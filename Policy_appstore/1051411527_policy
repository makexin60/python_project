FULL NOTICE
I. How and to whom does this Notice Apply?
Our Privacy Notice applies to all Trimble websites and to our web-based or mobile apps that reference this notice, either in the information provided with them or the contractual terms that govern your use of these apps. Some web-based apps may have a more specific privacy notice. Generally, Trimble Inc. and its affiliates are responsible for the processing of your personal information. However, some subsidiaries of Trimble may operate under their own privacy notices or a privacy notice which supplements this Trimble Privacy Notice.
This Privacy Notice applies to the processing of personal information submitted to us by, provided to us by, or otherwise collected by us from visitors and users of the various Trimble products, sites, services, attendees of Trimble events, customers and prospective customers and their representatives; subscribers to Trimble newsletters; and suppliers and business partners and their representatives. This Privacy Notice describes how we process personal data for our own purposes. We also process personal data on behalf of our customers subject to a written contract. We do not control the data processing or protection practices of our customers (who may be your employer, service provider to you or your business partner), which may differ from those set out in this Privacy Notice.

B. How Does Trimble Obtain Your Information
Information is collected directly from you through personal interactions, registrations for events or websites, or correspondence with us. Information is collected from your interactions with and use of our websites, apps, and products and services. We obtain information through our resellers and other channel partners. We complement information we receive directly from you with information from other sources, in accordance with applicable law. For example, we use data about the company you work for together with the information received from you to better understand the industry that you are working in. Furthermore, we obtain contact details, professional information, commercial information and behavioral data from business contact databases, publicly available resources, social networking websites and marketing service providers.
C. Some Processing Practices explained in Detail
Trimble ID
Trimble ID is our single sign on functionality. We process your contact details and login details such as user name and password. The purpose of this processing is to provide you access to our products and services to which you or your employer have purchased or subscribed.
Trimble Products, Software Services, Apps and Subscription Websites
Trimble offers various services to our customers. The data processed in the context of these services is processed generally on behalf of our customers (who may be your employer). When you use these services, Trimble will process the following data:
Usage Details. When you access our websites or use our apps, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the websites and apps, including location data, logs, back-end information and server calls, communication data, and the resources that you access and use on or through the websites and apps. The purpose for processing this information is to manage, secure and improve our products and services.
Device Information. Our servers may receive data from your browser or device when you visit one of our websites or use an app. That data can include your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located), device ID, operating systems, pages viewed, time spent, the type of browser and device you used, as well as the referring website, and if applicable, the search terms that led you to our website.
We require some of this usage and device information to provide you and our customers with certain functionality of our products, software, services, websites and apps.  If you do not want us to collect or process this usage and device information, do not use our products, software, services, access our websites, or download our app, or delete our app from your device if already downloaded.
Also, we use automated systems to analyze your use of our products, software, services, websites and apps using techniques such as machine learning in order to improve our products, software, services, apps and websites. This analysis may occur as the content is sent or received using an online feature of a Trimble app or website, or when the content is stored on Trimble servers.
Trimble app activation and automatic updates
When you are registered to use a Trimble product (software or hardware) for which we provide updates to you, we may process information about your Trimble product and any product on which you may have it installed (including your IP address), and your product serial number. Some of our apps connect to our servers and offer you the ability to install updates to the app, either in the background or upon your confirmation. We may keep track of information such as whether an update was successful or not. We may also use information collected through activation or app updates to validate that you hold a valid license to our product and confirm that it is genuine and properly licensed.
Trimble Emails and Marketing Automation
Trimble uses marketing automation platforms for sending emails. These platforms and other email clients track behavior related to those emails, including whether you have received or opened the email, opened an attachment or clicked a link in the email, or forwarded the email. If you do not want us to collect this information from future Trimble marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving Trimble marketing emails using the “Manage Preferences” or “Unsubscribe” link on the bottom of the email you received (either option may apply).
Stored Information and Files
Trimble may use cookies, web beacons or other tracking mechanisms to collect information about how you have used our websites and apps, and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the app or website. Depending on the website or app, we work to collect this information, depending on the website and the app, on an anonymous basis, or it may include references to you. We may also access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device. This may include, for example, cached image files.
Trimble online advertising
Trimble displays ads to you on our own websites and apps and through third parties’ (i.e. other companies') websites or apps, in various manners.  We collect information such as which ads are displayed, which ads are clicked on, and where the ad was displayed. If you download Trimble content offered on a displayed ad, identifiers relating to you and your computer usage will be collected as a part of that download process.  Certain US residents may have certain opt-out rights with respect to cross-context behavioral advertising and/or targeted advertising; for more information, see Section VII below.
Buttons, tools, and content from other companies
Sometimes our apps and websites link to other companies’ services via buttons, tools, or other content. We collect information about your use of these features. In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, or content, or view a Trimble web page or app containing them, information from your browser may automatically be sent to the other company. We encourage you to read that company’s privacy notice for more information about their privacy practices.
Trimble community pages
Trimble uses third party platforms for creating community sites for Trimble users, where, for example, 3D models can be shared. To become a member and receive access to a community site, you will be asked to set up a user account and to provide personal information as a part of a registration process.
Trimble social community
Trimble participates in social community sites and provides our information there (for example, our LinkedIn pages).
You may also be able to sign-in to a Trimble app or website using a social networking account, such as a Google account. When you use these sign-on features, we may collect information on you from the relevant social vendor for providing account access, including a unique identifier, email, first and last name.
Trimble places paid ads on social sites like LinkedIn or Facebook for engaging marketing thought leadership. Related content may also be offered. We require personal information as a part of webform submissions to provide access for downloading those materials.
Trimble for education
Trimble often offers a free version of some of its software to students as a part of a higher-education curriculum. In those instances, Trimble takes every precaution to protect the privacy of students with regards to personal data. At a minimum Trimble:
Confirms the student downloading software is 14 years of age or older;
Verifies all student data collected is used for the sole purpose of software registration and is not used for marketing purposes;
Uses third party education sites like G Suite for schools to protect the privacy of students (please refer to G Suite for their privacy policy with regards to students)
III. For what Purposes do we use this information?
Trimble uses the information we collect about you (including Usage Information) in a number of ways, such as:
Providing you with our apps and websites for which you have registered or which you have purchased or licensed, as well as any products, software, services, support, or information you have requested, purchased or licensed from us;
Performing our obligations to our clients which have purchased or licensed products, software and/or services used by you;
To deliver you services, products, and support as necessary to perform the contract governing your use of our applications or to communicate with you;
Improving our products, software, services, websites and apps and their user experience by analyzing their use to deliver a more personalized experience;
Generating de-identified and/or anonymized information about you or other users, and information that does not identify any individual or device, which may be used by us, our affiliates, and others without restriction;
Diagnosing problems in our products, software, services, apps and websites and notifying you of fixes;
Tailoring a website, app, or Trimble ad to your likely interests;
Providing you with functionality and/or marketing specific to your location;
Communicating with you with regards to your business relationship with us, for example, when a contract is established or performed, or notifying you when subscriptions expire;
Keeping you informed about our company, our product updates, new app releases, special offers, and similar information;
Conducting market research about our customers, their interests, and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;
Using your personal and behavioral data, to improve user experience of our products, software, services, websites and apps and to identify other persons that respond similarly;
Implementing cybersecurity initiatives, including reducing fraud, software and IP piracy, and protecting the confidentiality of your information;
As further described in supplemental privacy notices provided by us.
Monitoring usage and interaction statistics of our products, software, services, websites or apps, and/or to perform data analytics in order to assess and enhance our products, software, services, websites and/or apps; and
Monitoring and/or process automatic crash reporting or other technical issues.
IV. On what basis does Trimble collect and process this information?
For personal information collected about you in the EU, our basis for processing is the following:
In order to communicate adequately with you and to respond to your requests, we need to process information about you and therefore have a legitimate interest in processing this information.
In order to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners, and to process purchases and downloads of our products and services, we need to process information about you as necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.
We process personal information for marketing and sales activities based on your consent where so indicated on our sites at the time your personal information was collected, or further to our legitimate interest to market and promote our products and services.
We rely on our legitimate interest to analyze, develop, improve and optimize our sites, products and services, and to maintain the security of our sites, networks and systems.
In order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, or to process an opt-out request.
V. Data Transfers
A. Data Access
Trimble relies on other companies for a variety of reasons. We work with third party service providers, such as specialist companies in the area of processing credit card payments, providing software solutions, providing hosting services, or supporting our business processes. Some of these third party providers have access to your personal information in order to provide services to you on our behalf, in order to help us manage or improve our products and services, and/or in order to provide you with a satisfactory user experience. Under our contracts with these service providers, they are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes (but may be permitted to use and disclose anonymized and de-identified information provided you are not identified as the source of the information).
Trimble may also share your personal information:
With our affiliates (i.e. other companies of the Trimble group of companies) for the same purposes described in this privacy notice;
With third party providers (i.e. contractors or agencies) hired to deliver Trimble marketing programs on behalf of Trimble;
With our resellers or other authorized sales partners for the purpose of following up on your requests or marketing communications;
In legal proceedings in which we are a party or a third party, in compliance with lawful requests;
When we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to protect ourselves against fraud, for reasons of cyber defense, or otherwise protect the property and safety of Trimble, our affiliates, our customers and users;
If a company buys us or merges with us or we sell a part of our business and transfer customer information as part of this business: and
When you agree to the sharing.
B. Does Trimble transfer my personal information across national borders?
We may transfer your personal information across national borders to other countries in compliance with applicable laws.
If you reside within the European Economic Area your relationship is with Trimble Europe BV. When Trimble Europe BV transfers your personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom or Switzerland to a non-EEA country, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, and your consent.
We also receive some data in reliance on other compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
If the content or data that you store on or through Trimble software, services, apps or websites contains the personal information of individuals from the EEA, you agree that you have the legal authority to transfer the personal information to Trimble, including the transfer to countries such as the United States where the privacy protections and rights of authorities to access personal data may not be equivalent to those in the EEA.
The information above applies to Trimble users that have agreed to the Trimble Privacy Notice. More information is available for our business customers that want to learn more about European data transfers.
C. Is my personal information displayed anywhere on Trimble’s websites or applications?
There are places within Trimble’s websites and apps that allow you to upload or otherwise share content, models, comments, and to communicate with others. Sometimes you can limit who can see your contributions, but some places can be seen by other users of the app or website. Before sharing, make sure you understand with whom you are sharing your information. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and apps, your email address, user name, or name may be included and displayed with your message.
To remove content you have shared on our websites and apps, please use the same app or website feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact the
Trimble Office of Data Protection
.
VI. Data Retention, Storage and Security
A. Retention periods
Your personal data will be retained as long as necessary to provide you with the services requested. When we no longer need to use your personal data to comply with contractual or statutory obligations, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it, except as required under applicable legal or regulatory obligations, e.g. statutory retention periods which can result from tax requirements and other compliance requirements and usually contain retention periods up to 10 years, or if we need it to preserve evidence within the statutes of limitation, which is usually up to 7 years.
B. Is my personal information secure?
We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information. However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and Trimble cannot ensure or warrant the security of your personal information.
We restrict access to your personal information to our authorized employees, agents, and/or third party providers as necessary to fulfill our legal and business obligations and to provide you with our products, software, websites, services and apps.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) user log-in credentials (i.e. a user ID and password) for access to certain parts of our services or apps, you are responsible for keeping these user account credentials confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.  You are solely liable for the protection of user account credentials and for all use of your user account credentials.
Please note that we do not have any control over or responsibility for information or communications you share through our products, software, services, websites or apps, including for any third party websites accessed or linked through them.
C. Where does Trimble store my personal information?
Your personal information and files are stored on Trimble servers and the servers of our third party providers we hire to provide services to us. Your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide, and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world.
VII. What Rights and Choices do I have for my personal information? May I close my account with Trimble?
We strive to provide you with choices regarding your personal information. This section describes mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your personal information.
A. US Residents’ Privacy Rights and Choices (including under the California Consumer Privacy Act)
Subject to certain limitations, residents of California and certain other US states have rights relating to their personal information as further explained below and on the
Your Privacy Choices (for US residents)
page of the Trimble Privacy Center. If you seek to exercise your rights through an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you've provided your agent with a power of attorney, or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you're an authorized agent seeking to make a request, you will need to provide verification of your agency authorization.
Employees and candidates of Trimble should view the appropriate candidate/applicant/employee privacy notice located in the
Trimble Privacy Center
.
California residents should also review the
California Notice at Collection
which is incorporated by reference into and is made a part of this Privacy Notice.

through this page
, or by phone by calling 1-800-TRIMBLE. You may be required to verify your identity in connection with your exercise of this right.

B. Global Privacy Controls and “Do Not Track” Signals
Certain Internet browsers and browser extensions support the ability to transmit Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signals. If your browser is configured to send a GPC signal, our website will process that signal and respond by automatically opting you out of any tracking cookies that constitute a “sale” or “sharing” where required by applicable privacy law. GPC signals apply only to your device and Internet browser; if you visit our website from a different device or browser, you will need to reset your GPC settings. For more information about Global Privacy Controls and to learn how to implement it on your browser, please visit
globalprivacycontrol.org
.
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals in Internet browsers. Given a lack of support and adoption, Trimble does not respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, please visit
allaboutdnt.com
.
C. Certain Other Statutory Rights
You may have additional statutory rights under applicable law with regards to your personal information, including:
The right to access – this means you can request that we provide you with a copy of the personal information Trimble holds about you;
The right to correct – this means that you may ask us to correct any mistakes in that information, update your preferences, and/or to delete certain personal information.
NOTE: Many of our software, services, websites and apps allow you to edit your personal information by accessing "my account," "my profile," or a similar feature of the app or website. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our websites and apps by logging in and using the deletion functions available.  Please further note that in order to correct any information provided as part of your user profile from your company you will need to contact your company’s system administrator.

If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.  By using our website or app, you represent that you are not younger than 13.  If you think that we have collected personal information from a visitor or user under the age of 13, please contact the
Trimble Office of Data Protection
.

We will not make consumer data available to third parties.
If you have any questions about these rights or you need assistance with requesting any of these rights, please contact the
Trimble Office of Data Protection
. Please note that we need to retain certain information about you for legal and internal business reasons, such as fraud prevention.

Our privacy commitment
At Trimble, we are committed to your privacy. We know that we must earn your trust—and keep it—every time you use Trimble products and services to transform the way the world works. To make good on that promise, we’ve created this Privacy Center, where you’ll learn all about our approach to your privacy.
The Trimble Office of Data Protection works to ensure that your personal data is collected, shared and handled the right way. Please read our complete Privacy Notice for details on what this means to you. We start with a commitment to:
Being transparent in how and when we collect - and use your personal data
Simplifying our policies so they are easy to understand
Making sure you have control of your data at all times
Trimble's products and services are intended for commercial use, however, we often make our products available for students as a part of their higher learning curriculum. Due to the increased focus on the security and protection of student information, we make sure that our privacy practices comply with federal and global regulations.
This Privacy Center and our Privacy Notice does not cover other organizations' sites that may be accessible via links from our sites. These sites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to read them. We may often modify our Privacy Notice to update legal, technological and other developments. In that event, the changes will appear at this location.
Our customers have trusted us with their personal information for over 40 years, and we are committed to ensuring that you feel just as secure today. Your trust is our top priority. If you have a privacy question or concern, please contact Trimble Office of Data Protection.

Our privacy commitment
At Trimble, we are committed to your privacy. We know that we must earn your trust—and keep it—every time you use Trimble products and services to transform the way the world works. To make good on that promise, we’ve created this Privacy Center, where you’ll learn all about our approach to your privacy.
The Trimble Office of Data Protection works to ensure that your personal data is collected, shared and handled the right way. Please read our complete Privacy Notice for details on what this means to you. We start with a commitment to:
Being transparent in how and when we collect - and use your personal data
Simplifying our policies so they are easy to understand
Making sure you have control of your data at all times
Trimble's products and services are intended for commercial use, however, we often make our products available for students as a part of their higher learning curriculum. Due to the increased focus on the security and protection of student information, we make sure that our privacy practices comply with federal and global regulations.
This Privacy Center and our Privacy Notice does not cover other organizations' sites that may be accessible via links from our sites. These sites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to read them. We may often modify our Privacy Notice to update legal, technological and other developments. In that event, the changes will appear at this location.
Our customers have trusted us with their personal information for over 40 years, and we are committed to ensuring that you feel just as secure today. Your trust is our top priority. If you have a privacy question or concern, please contact Trimble Office of Data Protection.

Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.
Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.
Get Involved
GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
