Privacy
Welcome to MiraTrex!
Your privacy is critically important to us. At MiraTrex we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our services.
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.
MiraTrex, Inc. (“MiraTrex”) operates MiraTrex.com and produces applications available for download on the iTunes App Store. It is MiraTrex’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites or apps.
Website Visitors and App Customers
Like most website or app operators, MiraTrex collects non-personally-identifying information that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MiraTrex’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MiraTrex’s visitors use its website.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to MiraTrex’s websites choose to interact with MiraTrex in ways that require MiraTrex to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MiraTrex gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with us by purchasing our products, for example, are asked to provide additional information, including personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, MiraTrex collects such information only to fulfill the purpose of the customer’s interaction with MiraTrex or its apps. MiraTrex does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
MiraTrex discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MiraTrex’s behalf or to provide services available at MiraTrex’s websites or its apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. MiraTrex will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MiraTrex discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when MiraTrex believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MiraTrex, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a MiraTrex app and have supplied your email address, MiraTrex may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with MiraTrex and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MiraTrex takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
