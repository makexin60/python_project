Purposes & Features
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Illustrations
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Illustrations
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 3
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Illustrations
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Number of Vendors seeking consent: 3
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Illustrations
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.
Number of Vendors seeking consent: 3
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Illustrations
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.
Number of Vendors seeking consent: 0
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Illustrations
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Number of Vendors seeking consent: 0
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Illustrations
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 3
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Illustrations
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 0
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Illustrations
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Illustrations
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 3
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Illustrations
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.
Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 0
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Illustrations
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Number of Vendors seeking consent: 3
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Illustrations
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Number of Vendors seeking consent: 3
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Illustrations
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Number of Vendors seeking consent: 2

Last updated:

Appcues is committed to protecting the privacy of all its users.
In order to ensure that our customers and users are informed of our data handling policies and their rights pertaining to their personally-identifiable information (PII), we maintain this privacy policy, which details our practices around information collected through the Appcues platform. In this privacy policy, PII refers to information that can be used to identify you (such as your name, email address, or other contact information) and other information that is linked to your personal identifiers (such as login information).
1. Overview

2.1. End-user PII

2.4. Customer Aggregate Data

5. Other Uses of Data

5.2. Transfer of Ownership
6. Changes to this Privacy Policy
7. Contact Information
1. Overview
Our approach to data security and privacy includes but is not limited to:
At-rest and in-transit encryption of all customer and end-user data;
Customer control, via
Identity Verification
, of the amount of PII handled by Appcues;
A
Share Responsibility Model for Security and Privacy
; and
Establishment of the
Appcues Trust Center
and implementation of the measures identified there.
2. Kinds of Information We Collect
Appcues processes four different categories of data, which reflect the different levels of sensitivity in context. However, there are several common traits about how we handle the data, regardless of type:
We never sell data to third parties.
In limited cases, we provide it to third-party services for usage strictly within the Appcues product or business; for example, to provide analytics graphs in the Appcues Studio application.
All PII is subject to the protections of applicable data protection laws
; for example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation as to PII that originates from the European Union.
2.1. End-user PII
This data can be used to identify a specific user. Examples of end-user PII include:
User profile data passed to Appcues by the customer, using the `Appcues.identify()` SDK method;
Environment information that is collected by default in the Appcues SDK when associated with a particular user; and
Browsing history data that is collected by default in the Appcues JavaScript SDK (e.g., current page URL, current page title).
We use End-user PII to customize and deliver Appcues experiences.  We do not share End-user PII except as described in this privacy policy or as directed by our customers. For example, enabling third-party integrations with Appcues, which necessarily involve sharing information in order for the integration to work, is up to the discretion of the customer.
Customers may opt out of browser and browser history information by contacting Appcues Support.
2.2. End-user Appcues Data
This data pertains to how end users are interacting with Appcues experiences; for example, whether a flow was shown to a given user, whether a user has interacted with a tooltip, etc. This category also includes user responses to in-Appcues forms or surveys. This data stream is available for CSV download on the Appcues Studio application.
We do not actively collect PII for use in this category, and no PII is required in this category in order to use Appcues.
Note, however, that form or survey responses may add PII to this data
.
We use data in this category to customize and deliver Appcues experiences, as well as display analytics on the Appcues Studio application.
Customers may also configure Appcues to send certain data upstream to other services.
‍Please refer to the Shared Responsibility Model for further information.
2.3. Customer PII
This data includes business-relationship information, such as the name and email address of each of a customer's team members who are authorized to use the Appcues platform. We collect customer PII through the Appcues Studio application.
Appcues does not handle or store financial data about customers (e.g., credit card information). Instead, we use a fully PCI DSS compliant payments processor.
We use this type of data mainly in the Appcues Studio application and Builder, and within the Appcues business.
2.4. Customer Aggregate Data
This category includes customer-wide, aggregated statistics such as active user count, number of Appcues experiences shown, how many Appcues experiences are published at a time, etc.
This data does not contain PII.
We use data in this category mainly in the Appcues Studio application and Builder, customer emails, and within the Appcues business.
3. Controlling Your Data
If you have interacted with Appcues content, then Appcues may have some data relating to you and your activity on that app or website. The types of data that we might have are described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this privacy policy. Appcues provides you with certain choices and means for exercising your rights to your PII, such as accessing, correcting, amending, deleting or limiting the use and disclosure of your PII. For example, if we wish to use or share PII we have collected from you for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which we originally collected your PII or for which you later provided consent, then we will ask you for your consent before such use or sharing, and we will provide you with an effective way to opt out of such use or sharing. A further description of your rights and our commitment to compliance with applicable law is set forth below in Section 4. To exercise your rights, please contact us at the address listed at the bottom of this privacy policy and, where applicable, please provide your account ID and user ID along with a description of the nature of your request so that we can verify and act on your request. Please keep in mind that where Appcues is acting as a service provider to your organization, PII collected by us in connection with our services is controlled by your organization, as described at the end of Section 4 below.
4. Security and Compliance
4.1. Encryption
Appcues is committed to the privacy of information as it passes over our network, as well as to preventing unauthorized access to customer or end-user data. Among other technical and organizational measures we have implemented to protect data, we use industry-leading encryption to protect all external traffic in transit (via
HTTPS/TLS
) and at rest (using
AES-256
and an automated key rotation system).
4.2. Data Retention
We delete end-user and customer data promptly upon verified request by the applicable customer or end user, except to the extent required by applicable law or to perform or enforce the terms of applicable contracts. Some data may remain in archival backups, which are deleted in the ordinary course of business.
Requests for data deletion may be addressed to
support@appcues.com
.
4.3. ‍Shared Responsibility Model
Appcues invests heavily and continually monitors the Appcues platform to protect the security and privacy of our customer data. However, if our customers use certain Appcues features, they will have a responsibility to take action to fully protect the security and privacy of the data managed by Appcues. This is commonly referred to as a shared responsibility model. The
Shared Responsibility Model
describes the shared responsibility of certain Appcues features and their benefits.  Please refer to the
Appcues Documentation
for more information. As new capabilities are introduced, or responsibilities are identified, the Shared Responsibility Model documentation will be updated or expanded.
4.4. EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, with UK Extension
Appcues complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the “EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (the “UK Extension”), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the “Swiss-U.S. DPF” and, collectively, the “DPFs”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Appcues has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Principles set forth in each of the foregoing (collectively, the “DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of PII received from the European Economic Area (that is, the EU Member states, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, collectively, the “EEA”) in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar in reliance on the UK Extension, and from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and any such DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
Under the DPFs, we are responsible for the processing of PII we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We comply with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of PII, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to PII received or transferred under the DPFs, we are subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose PII in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Appcues is committed to addressing inquiries and resolving complaints about our collection and use of PII. If you have such an inquiry or complaint, please first contact us using the contact information specified at the bottom of this privacy policy.
In compliance with the DPFs, we have committed to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of PII transferred to us in reliance on the DPFs to an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you live in the EEA, UK or Switzerland and have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html
.  Under certain conditions, more fully described on the
DPF website
, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
4.5. Other Applicable Law
You may have rights under other applicable data protection laws. For example, if you are a resident of California, then under California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “CCPA”), you may have specific rights relating to your PII. Your rights depend on the nature and purpose of the collection and use of your PII and may include the right to be informed about categories of PII we collect, categories of the sources of PII, and categories of third parties with whom we share PII.  This information is provided in the applicable sections of this privacy policy. You may also have the right to request information about the specific PII we may have about you, and you may do so by contacting us as set forth below.  In some cases, you may have the right to request that we delete PII we may have about you. We will respond and, where applicable, comply with your requests free of charge and within the timeframe required under applicable law.
We do not share PII for direct marketing (including cross-context behavioral advertising) purposes, and, as noted above, we do not sell PII for any purpose. Therefore, the elements of CCPA or other applicable law relating to the sale or “commercial” use of PII do not apply to us. Similarly, we do not track users over time across third-party, non-customer websites, and therefore we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated “do not track” signals.
We recognize the evolving privacy landscape and the growing list of states with data privacy laws that provide rights similar or in addition to those under CCPA.  We respect the privacy rights of all of our users, and we do not discriminate against our users based on their data-privacy choices or the exercise of their rights under applicable laws. We are committed to complying with all data protection laws to the extent they apply to us, and to assisting assist our customers in their compliance obligations as applicable and appropriate. You do not need to establish an account with us or be a registered user in order to send us a request, but if you already have an account with us, we may communicate with you about your request through your account. To exercise your rights, please contact us at the address listed below. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your request.
Please note that your rights under certain data protection laws depend in part on the nature of your relationship with us.  For example, if we are processing your PII in the role of a service provider to your organization as our customer, then your organization is responsible for the instructions it gives to us regarding your PII, and if you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please direct your inquiry to your organization. Because we may only access and use our customer’s data (which may include your PII) in accordance with instructions from the applicable customer, if you are a customer user and you make your request directly to us, we will refer your request to that customer, although we will support them as required by applicable data protection laws in responding to your request.
5. Other Uses of Data
5.1. Enforcement
All policies and practices described in this privacy policy are subject to our obligation to  comply with applicable law, including any lawful request by public authorities. We may disclose any information necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of service or other applicable agreement, or as otherwise required by law
5.2. Transfer of Ownership
If Appcues merges with or is acquired by another company, our data, including your PII, may be transferred to the other company, and the terms of this privacy policy may be subject to change.
We use the information you provide about yourself when doing business with us only to provide the service that you have requested, including customer service, during the term of your or your organization’s agreement with us. We do not share this information with outside parties, other than the service providers described above, without your permission.
Finally, we never use or share PII provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses, except under the circumstances described in this privacy policy.
6. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Any changes we make will be effective immediately as of the date the modified privacy policy is made available through our services or on our website. By continuing to access or use our services after we have posted a modification to this privacy policy, you are indicating that you agree to the terms of the modified privacy policy.

Appcues Responsibilities
Customer Responsibilities
As described in the
Appcues Trust Center
, Appcues invests heavily and continually monitors the Appcues platform to protect the security and privacy of our customer data. However, if your organization uses certain Appcues features, you also have a responsibility to take action to fully protect the security and privacy of the data managed by Appcues.  This is commonly referred to as a shared responsibility model. This document describes the shared responsibility of certain Appcues features and their benefits.  As new capabilities are introduced, or responsibilities are identified, this page will be updated or expanded.
Appcues Responsibilities
Appcues maintains comprehensive documentation regarding the security of the Appcues platform and the Appcues Security Program in our
Trust Center
.  Security is ever-evolving, and Appcues regularly makes updates or improvements documented there.  A few notable aspects of our security program include:
All customer data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
Documentation is maintained to ensure an Appcues installation is compatible with
Content Security Policies
.
A SOC-2 audit and report is performed annually by a professional 3rd party auditor.
A Penetration Test and report is conducted annually by a professional 3rd party security research firm.
Within 48 hours of discovering any security incident, notice will be sent to impacted Appcues account administrators.
For accounts enabled for
HIPAA compliance
, Appcues also ensures all data is processed according to HIPAA regulations.
Customer Responsibilities
The following items are not required to operate Appcues, but by following these responsibilities, customers can improve their security posture using Appcues.
Customers are responsible for what data they send to Appcues. While Appcues implements many controls to secure customer data while in transit and stored, Appcues cannot determine the sensitivity of the data you send.  Appcues also cannot control what data you export from Appcues or send to 3rd party integrations. To limit the data received by Appcues, you can use Appcues
Ingest Filtering
.
If the data you send to Appcues or the Experiences you display are sensitive (e.g. contains PII or confidential information that must be shown only to the appropriate user),  you can leverage
Identity Verification
to digitally sign your UserIDs to ensure that only intended users can see Appcues experiences.   This is required if you want
HIPAA compliance
to protect PHI.
To process data deletion requests according to GDPR, CCPA, or other similar privacy laws, Appcues requires you to confirm the identity of the user, and once confirmed, forward the request to Appcues by contacting
support@appcues.com
.  Appcues cannot handle requests directly from your end users since we cannot verify their identity.
Customers that use content integrity tags should follow the guidance in the Appcues
Content Integrity Tags
documentation.
