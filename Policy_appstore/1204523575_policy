VIALTO PARTNERS PRIVACY STATEMENT
1. Introduction
Vialto Partners is strongly committed to protecting personal data. This privacy statement describes why and how we collect and use personal data and provides information about individuals’ rights in relation to the personal data that we collect and use. It applies to personal data provided to us, both directly by individuals themselves and indirectly by others. We may use personal data provided to us for any of the purposes described in this privacy statement or as otherwise stated at the point of collection of the personal data.
As used in this privacy statement, the terms “Vialto Partners”, “us”, and “we” refer to the Vialto Partners network and/or one or more of the entities within the Vialto Partners Network (collectively, “Vialto Entities” and each individually, a “Vialto Entity”) that may process your personal data. Each Vialto Entity in the Vialto Partners network is a separate legal entity. The “data controllers” of your personal data may be one or more of the Vialto Entities or, with respect to individuals associated with our corporate clients, may be your employer. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, “data controller(s)” refers to the entity (or entities) that determine the purposes and means for processing your personal data, or that have a similar role or status under your applicable local privacy laws and regulations (“Applicable Local Law”).
To see a list of Vialto Entities and the countries and regions in which Vialto Entities operate, please refer to the list of Vialto Entities available at
www.vialto.com/about
.
Vialto Partners processes personal data for numerous purposes. Our policy is to be transparent about
why
and
how
we process personal data.
To find out more about our specific processing activities, please refer to the
“Our processing activities”
section of this privacy statement. In addition to the information contained in the main body of this privacy statement, please refer to the section of Appendix A (Categories of Individuals about Whom We May Process Personal Data) of this privacy statement applicable to you for additional information about our collection, use and retention of your personal data. Additionally, if relevant to you, please refer to Appendix B (Jurisdiction Specific Provisions) of this privacy statement for additional information that may apply to you based on the jurisdiction in which you reside.
2. Our legal grounds for processing your personal data
Your Applicable Local Law may require us to set out in this privacy statement the legal grounds on which we rely in order to process your personal data. In such cases, we may rely on one or more of the following legal grounds (in each case, to the extent it is a valid legal ground under the Applicable Local Law):
our legitimate interests in the effective delivery of information and services to you and in the effective and lawful operation of our businesses and the legitimate interests of our clients in receiving professional services from us as part of running their organisation (provided these do not interfere with your rights);
our legitimate interests in developing and improving our businesses, services and offerings and in developing new Vialto Partners technologies and offerings (provided these do not interfere with your rights);
to satisfy any requirement of law, regulation or professional body of which we are a member (for example, for some of our services, we have a legal obligation to provide the service in a certain way);
to perform our obligations under a contractual arrangement with you or to takes steps at your request prior to entering into a contractual arrangement with you;
if you have consented to us processing your personal data for the relevant purpose. Given that Vialto Partners can typically rely on another legal basis for the processing of personal data, we do not generally process personal data on the basis of consent. Consent will only serve as the legal basis for processing of personal data where (i) no other legal basis can be relied on, or (ii) where Applicable Local Law requires explicit consent to be obtained for the processing of personal data for the relevant purpose to be permitted; or
other legal grounds for processing as defined by Applicable Local Laws.
3. Transfers and disclosures of personal data
Cross-border transfers
If we process your personal data, your personal data may be transferred to, and stored outside of, the country where you are located. The country(ies) to which your personal data is transferred or in which your personal data is stored may not have laws that provide specific protections for personal data or may not have laws that provide an equivalent level of protection for personal data as the Applicable Local Laws of the country in which you are located, and your personal data may be subject to access by the courts, law enforcement or national security authorities of such jurisdiction.
Other Vialto Entities
For details of Vialto Entity locations, please see
www.vialto.com/about
.
We may share personal data with other Vialto Entities where necessary in connection with the purposes described in this privacy statement. For example, when providing professional services to a client, we may share personal data with Vialto Entities in different territories that are involved in providing services to that client.
Third Party Providers
We may transfer or disclose the personal data that we collect to third party vendors, contractors, subcontractors, and/or their subsidiaries and affiliates. Third parties support the Vialto Partners network in providing our services and help provide, run and manage our IT systems. Examples of third parties that we may use include, without limitation, providers of: identity management, data hosting and storage services, email hosting, website hosting and management, cookie management, SMS and email communication tools and platforms, data analysis, data backup, security, cloud storage services, customer service request management, document management, secure file transfer services, customer relationship management services and vendor management services. The servers powering and facilitating our IT infrastructure are located in secure data centres around the world, and personal data may be stored in any one of them.
Our third party providers may use their own third party subcontractors or vendors that have access to personal data (sub-processors). It is our policy to use only third party providers that are bound to maintain appropriate levels of security and confidentiality, to process personal data only as instructed and/or agreed in writing by Vialto Partners, and to flow those same obligations down to their sub-processors.
Other disclosures
We may also disclose personal data under the following circumstances:
to our professional advisers (such as law firms, auditors, consultants or other professional advisors) as necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights, obtain advice or as otherwise necessary or relevant in connection with the running of our business. Personal data may be shared with these advisers as necessary in connection with the services they have been engaged to provide;
when explicitly requested by you;
where your employer has retained Vialto Partners to provide professional services to you, we may disclose personal data to your employer (or any affiliate thereof if requested by your employer);
when required to deliver publications or reference materials requested by you;
when required to facilitate conferences or events hosted by a third party;
to law enforcement, regulatory and other government agencies and to professional bodies, as required by and/or in accordance with applicable law, regulation or our professional obligations. Vialto Partners may also review and use your personal data to determine whether disclosure is required or permitted;
where our services are being transitioned to a new provider, to your employer to facilitate such transition or directly to such new provider; or
in connection with a corporate reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or capital (a “Corporate Event”), we may disclose your information to the acquiring entity or the target entity, as applicable, and to our consultants, outside counsel and other advisors assisting in such Corporate Event.

request deletion of your personal data;
restrict the processing of your personal data;
object to the processing of your personal data;
