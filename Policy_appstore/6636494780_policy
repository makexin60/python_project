If you do not provide the information we need, or help us keep it up to date, we may not be able to provide you with our products and services.
Sometimes we need your consent to use your personal information. With direct marketing for example, we need your consent to make you aware of products and services which may be of interest to you. We may do this by phone, post, email, text or through other digital media. When we use sensitive personal information about you, such as medical or biometric data, we ask for your consent. Before you give your consent, we tell you what information we collect and what we use it for. You can remove your consent at any time by contacting us.

Where the third party is a data processor, we require that these third parties provide a sufficient guarantee that the necessary safeguards and controls have been implemented to ensure there is no impact on your data rights and freedoms.
We also have to share information with third parties to meet any applicable law, regulation or lawful request. When we believe we have been given false or misleading information, or we suspect criminal activity we must record this and tell law enforcement agencies, which may be either in or outside Ireland.”

our Data Protection Notice.
International Transfer of Data
We may transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) to help us provide your products and services. We expect the same standard of data protection is applied outside of the EEA to these transfers and the use of the information, to ensure your rights are protected.

PLEASE NOTE that this Privacy Statement is subject to the Terms and Conditions of use of the New Ireland website. We recommend that you read the Terms and Conditions of use. If there is a conflict between the Terms and Conditions of use and this Privacy Statement, the Terms and Conditions of use shall prevail. Except as otherwise provided, terms used herein and defined in the Terms and Conditions of use shall have the same meaning that is given to them in the Terms and Conditions of use.
The contents of this Privacy Statement are subject to change and to being updated without notice from time to time.

We will only ask for personal information from which you can be identified (such as your name, address, email address etc.) where the information is required for a specific purpose e.g. to reply to any queries or questions that you may have. This gathering of information is consistent with our normal work practices. All information provided to us by you will be treated with the utmost confidentiality in accordance with all applicable legislative and regulatory standards. If you ever decide that you no longer wish us to keep or use information or you want the information to be revised or updated, please feel free to contact us.

Disclosure of Information

We have received authorisation from you so to do or
We are required to do so by law
For the purposes of verification, fraud prevention and detection and risk management we will exchange information with reputable reference sources and clearing house services.
Security of Information
At www.newireland.ie we understand how important the security and confidentiality of your information is to you. Keeping customers’ information secure is a top priority for New Ireland. Our goal is to protect your information on the Internet in the same way as we would our normal business information.
However, public internet email is a communication channel which cannot be guaranteed to be secure. As such, there are no guarantees that any email or its contents:
will be delivered within a reasonable timeframe or at all,
comes from the purported sender,
has not been intercepted by a third party,
are unaltered from the time of transmission.
As a result New Ireland cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of information relating to you passing over the Internet.
Internet Fraud
A number of financial organisations and their customers have recently been the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account/policy details of the customers. Some of these hoax e-mails have encouraged or facilitated contact with hoax websites that purport to be (but are not) the website of the relevant financial organisation. In all cases, we would advise you to be cautious as regards disclosing your personal details. In particular, you should note that we will only ever request your personal details if:(i) you are seeking to initiate e-mail contact with us via this website; or (ii) you initiate a request for a particular service via this website and we require certain personal details to provide you with the requested service e.g. where the requested service is a request for a telephone call from a sales advisor, or a request for a pensions information pack or other product information etc.
Hyperlinks
Some of the pages on this website contain hypertext links to websites not maintained by New Ireland. You are reminded that different terms and conditions of use will apply to you as a user of such websites. In addition such websites may not attain the same privacy standards that New Ireland maintains.

What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that our website asks your browser to store on your device in order to retrieve information to perform certain functions and remember visits to our website. These cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies to assist with our marketing and advertising efforts. A third-party cookie is one set by a domain other than the one you are visiting.
There are two distinct types of cookies. First are called “session cookies” and these last for the duration of your visit and are deleted from your computer or device when you close your browser. The second type of cookies used are called “persistent cookies” which are saved for a defined period of time on your computer or device or until they are forcibly deleted.

We use Matomo as our First Party Analytics provider to track user’s behaviour and performance on our website. By default a cookie-less version of Matomo is used which you can disable. This means:

this data is never shared with third parties;
users aren’t tracked across websites;
a user cannot be tracked across days within the same website (no user profiles can be generated when cookies are disabled);
When a user consents to Performance tracking Matomo will use cookies, Matomo will use them to generate an anonymised user profile to help us understand how users interact with our websites. This data is never shared with third parties.
Disabling First Party Analytics (Matomo)
You may choose to prevent this website from aggregating and analysing the actions you take here. Doing so will protect your privacy, but will also prevent the owner from learning from your actions on the website and creating a better experience for you and other users.
Disable First Party Analytics
Davy uses hCaptcha
We use hCaptcha as a human verification tool during the private site login and account set up functions. This measure is to assist in preventing automated or scripted attacks. This feature is provided by hCaptcha and does not collect your personal data.
