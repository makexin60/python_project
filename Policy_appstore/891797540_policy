This app has been my go to for my non-Audible audiobooks. Does not lose my place and a very easy to use web interface for uploading books (fantastic as a zip file).

Especially after itunes turned into apple music , all audibooks kicked out to ibooks. Ibooks doesnt provide a good listenning experience. this program fills the gap and does a great job.

The only audiobook player I found that works and is updated regularly. Works great when bringing your own files.
