Our Vehicles
Connected car and telematics data
Our vehicles may be equipped with telematics devices such as pre-installed event data recorders, global positioning devices, OnStar® and other communications systems that may be connected to the Internet or cellular services. We (and at times the vehicle manufacturer and other authorised third parties) may collect information from these telematics devices, other services and technologies, and use and share it as described below or as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy. This information is associated with the vehicle only and maintained without being linked to an individual. This information will be linked to an individual only for the purposes and in the situations described below. Any information that is linked to you will be treated as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for informing passengers and other drivers that vehicle data is collected and used as described in this section.
You may also choose to accept or purchase optional devices that enable you to collect certain vehicle data.  Please refer to the manufacturer's terms and conditions and privacy policy.
The use of telematics devices and other pre-installed services and technologies are subject to our rental terms and conditions and, in some cases, the vehicle manufacturer's and/or technology provider's terms and conditions and privacy policy.  For OnStar, information is available at
www.onstar.com
.  For other vehicle manufacturers, please visit
here
.  Some or all of these features may be turned on at all times, even when other services or other media in the vehicle are turned off.  If you are unsure whether your rental vehicle contains telematics devices or technologies or systems, please speak to a member of our team at the rental location.
Depending on your type of rental, we collect and use vehicle data as follows:

We will also use, disclose and have access to this information.
We retain vehicle information based on retention periods in accordance with our business needs and legal requirements.  We may use and store this data after the expiry of our contract with you.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of such information. You should delete all such personal information and other data from these systems or devices before the vehicle is returned to avoid subsequent occupants of the vehicle accessing this information.
If you download a mobile app made available by a vehicle manufacturer or other third parties and register or enrol the vehicle in that app, your use of the app may result in the sharing of telematics data and other information (including location information and personal information) with the vehicle manufacturer or other third parties. Your use of these apps is strictly governed by the third-party mobile apps' terms and conditions and privacy policies. Before the vehicle is returned, you should either remove the app from your mobile device or delete the vehicle from the app.

We (and at times the vehicle manufacturer and other authorised third parties) may collect information from these telematics devices, other services and technologies, and use and share it as described below or as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy. This information is associated with the vehicle only and maintained without being linked to an individual. This information will be linked to an individual only for the purposes and in the situations described below. Any information that is linked to you will be treated as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for informing passengers and other drivers that vehicle data is collected and used as described in this section.
You may also choose to accept or purchase optional devices that enable you to collect certain vehicle data.  Please refer to the manufacturer's terms and conditions and privacy policy.
The use of telematics devices and other pre-installed services and technologies are subject to our rental terms and conditions and, in some cases, the vehicle manufacturer's and/or technology provider's terms and conditions and privacy policy.  For OnStar, information is available at
www.onstar.com
.  For other vehicle manufacturers, please visit

.  Some or all of these features may be turned on at all times, even when other services or other media in the vehicle are turned off.  If you are unsure whether your rental vehicle contains telematics devices or technologies or systems, please speak to a member of our team at the rental location.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of such information. You should delete all such personal information and other data from these systems or devices before the vehicle is returned to avoid subsequent occupants of the vehicle accessing this information.
If you download a mobile app made available by a vehicle manufacturer or other third parties and register or enrol the vehicle in that app, your use of the app may result in the sharing of telematics data and other information (including location information and personal information) with the vehicle manufacturer or other third parties. Your use of these apps is strictly governed by the third-party mobile apps' terms and conditions and privacy policies.

We participate in and have certified our compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the "Frameworks"). We are committed to treating all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, the U.K. and Switzerland in reliance on these Frameworks and their applicable principles.
To learn more about the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's website (
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/
) . With respect to information received or transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by U.S. public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Enterprise Holdings is responsible for the processing of personal data that it receives under the Frameworks and subsequently transfers to third parties acting as an agent on its behalf. Enterprise Holdings complies with the Frameworks' applicable principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, the U.K. and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that you feel we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at

Under certain conditions, as more fully described on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website (https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
