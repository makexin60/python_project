Legal Bases for Processing
In connection with our European Services, we will only collect, use, share, or otherwise process your personal data in accordance with one of the below lawful bases:
-	Performance of a contract:
This is where the processing is necessary for a contract we have with you, or you have asked us to take specific steps before entering into a contract, such as providing you with a quote. This lawful basis covers the following purposes:
o	Providing our services to you.
o	Providing customer support and account administration and communicating with you and about your engagement with us.
o	Managing payments for the services we provide you which includes billing process through our Website.

Our legitimate interests include the following purposes:
o	Performing service enhancement activities. Our legitimate interest is making services and features more relevant and improving our services and user experience.
o	Ensuring proper administration of our business. Our legitimate interest is ensuring the continuity of our service.
o	Preventing, detecting and fighting fraud or other illegal or unauthorized activities, as well as checking your identity and credentials. Our legitimate interest is preserving the security of our service.
o	Providing you with marketing communications about our services. Where consent is not required, as you or the company you represent are an existing customer who purchased or negotiated to purchase a similar service or product in the past, we may send you marketing communications based on our
legitimate interest
pursued by us or our service providers acting on our behalf or by a third-party. Our legitimate interest is promoting our business and to provide you with offers of relevant services.
-	Consent:
We may provide and send you marketing communications based on your consent. You may be given the option to explicitly consent to share your data with selected third parties for marketing purposes or to sign up for related products and services. This will be via a separate notice via the Website or App. We will never assume that we have your consent unless you have explicitly opted in, and you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.

o	Establish, exercise or defend legal claims in suspected or actual legal proceedings when investigating, for example, a civil claim.
Data Retention
We retain personal data about you for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in these Disclosures, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.The criteria used to determine the period for which personal data about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal data:
Legitimate Interests: Where we are processing personal data based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
Consent: Where we are processing personal data based on your consent, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the underlying agreement with you, subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your data erased (please see the Your Privacy Rights section below).
Contract: Where we are processing personal data based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.
Legal Obligation: Where we are processing personal data based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation.
Legal Claim: We may need to apply a ‚Äúlegal hold‚Äù that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data.
