The Credit Union's principal operating system is provided by Progress.
International transfer
CLCU does not currently transfer personal data to any recipients outside of the EEA European Economic Area unless.
-  members use online identity validation software,
-  requested to do so by the subject or
-  in the course to the recovery of a debt where connected parties are outside of the EEA.
If a service provider to the Credit Union is international in nature, or sub processes with entities that are not within the EU, we will take steps to ensure that personal data is retained in the EU and that any further processing that may expose such data to international transfer is subject to the protections provided by a lawful basis of transfer.
Responsibility of Members and others who provide personal data to us
You warrant that personal information provided to us by you that relates to third parties (e.g., family, guarantors, nominees) for the administration and delivery of services being provided, or while engaging with us in any other way, has been obtained fairly and lawfully and that such information is accurate. You also warrant that third parties introduced by you are aware of the purpose for which their personal data is being used and that their privacy rights have been upheld.
Information relating to children and vulnerable persons
The processing of personal data relating to children receives special attention under Data Protection Regulation and we shall treat this information with particular care. Children are defined as under 16's in Ireland. Information obtained about children shall comply with the requirement for parental consent and shall receive additional consideration while planning an operational process.
Special (Sensitive) Data
CLCU recognises special categories of data, specifically personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religious of philosophical beliefs, trades union membership, genetic or biometric data, or a subject’s health or sexual life. The processing of these categories of information shall typically require consent. We may also process Special data where there is a legal/regulatory obligation, there is a legitimate interest or where it is in the public interest.
Health data may be processed for the processing of an insurance or mortgage product under Irish law. Such processing will not normally require your consent.
Nominations
Irish legislation enables the nomination of successors to a deceased member's property in their Credit Union account and provides for special treatment independent of the deceased persons estate. This is a unique facility available to Credit Unions and all members are entitled to a nominate successor(s). A Member's nomination together with a record of revocations (the revoking of a nomination) shall be retained confidentially by the Credit Union. Personal data relating to nominations will be retained for up to six years following the completion of the nomination process.
CLCU will request confirmation of a Nominee’s identity, relationship to the member, and payment details to administer a valid nomination following the death of a member. Nomination information may be transferred to advisors, auditors, administrative staff and recognised oversight authorities for the administration of this facility and will always be bound by confidentiality obligations.
Confidentiality & security
CLCU have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security to protect personal data from alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or destruction, and from use for unauthorised purposes. Furthermore, we have taken measures to ensure that contracts with all third parties that provide technical and processing services include terms that specify appropriate technical and organisational security measures to prevent accidental, unauthorised, or unlawful disclosure or processing of personal data.
Debit Card
If we issue you with a debit card, transact Payments Malta Limited (which is an authorised e-money institution) will also be a controller of your personal data. In order for you to understand what they do with your personal data, and how to exercise your rights in respect of their processing of you personal data, you should review their privacy policy which is available at
