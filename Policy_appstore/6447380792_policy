Privacy
Put simply, none of your data is viewable by us. If an app requests your location, access to your images, music or health data, it's just with Apple's APIs and for the functioning of the app. None of this data leaves your device.

            Any data that is synced through Apple's iCloud service is also not viewable by us.
Debugging Data
We use Apple's built in service for crash data. We can only view your type of device, version of iOS and the date when the crash occurred. Also the steps which were taken before the app crashed. However no personal identifiable information is viewable by us.

            If you have other questions regarding your privacy don't hesitate to
