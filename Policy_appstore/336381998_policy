Overview
This section provides an overview of Forter and the Forter Services and a summary of the information provided below in the full version of this Privacy Policy. The full version of this Privacy Policy contains more detailed information regarding our privacy practices.
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at privacy@forter.com.
Who we are and what we do
Forter is a global company that provides fraud and abuse detection and trust-based products and services (the “
Forter Services
”) designed to help e-commerce merchants (our “
Merchants
”) detect and prevent fraud and abuse on their websites, mobile applications and other digital assets (the “
Merchant Sites
”), using our proprietary machine learning technology. In order to provide the Forter Services to our Merchants, we need to collect and process certain information about individuals who visit and interact with their Merchant Sites as end users (“
End Users
”), which information may include data that identifies or can be used to identify End Users, including name, address, telephone number and email address, and transaction, behavioral, device and connection data, as well as other information about End Users that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data (such data, “
Personal Data
”). Our proprietary machine learning technology uses this information to detect and prevent fraud and abuse on the Merchant Sites in real time. You can learn more about our products
here
.
How the Forter Services work
Our Merchants provide us with data and information about End Users and their interactions on their Merchant Sites through our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We also collect behavioral, device and connection data directly from End Users through standard tracking technologies (our JavaScript and mobile SDK), which are embedded on the Merchant Sites (collectively, “
End User Data
”). End User Data may include Personal Data. We do not collect any “special categories” of personal data about End Users (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, or information about your health or genetic or biometric data).
Once we have collected relevant End User Data, we process this data through our machine learning platform to return a recommendation to our Merchants as to whether to approve or decline a transaction or other event (e.g., an account signup or login event or abuse of a Merchant’s policies), or make a recommendation (e.g., for additional verification), on a particular Merchant Site. In addition to these decisions, we provide our Merchants with aggregated reporting and insights into transactions and other relevant events on their Merchant Sites.
Our recommendations, reporting and insights are used by our Merchants to assist them in detecting and preventing fraud and abuse on their Merchant Sites. It is ultimately up to our Merchants to decide what action to take or not to take using the information and insights we provide.
We also use End User Data (including Personal Data) across our network of Merchants to improve our modeling and algorithms and to provide more accurate recommendations for all of our Merchants. While we use End User Data for such purposes, we never share End User Data between our Merchants.
Overview of our privacy practices
We collect End User Personal Data when you interact with the Merchant Sites, through our APIs and standard tracking technologies, as further described below.
We rely on our and our Merchants’ legitimate interests in detecting and preventing fraud and abuse as the legal basis for our processing of End User Personal Data, as further described below.
We do not rent or sell your Personal Data, and we do not share your Personal Data with third parties, other than with select trusted third party service providers, to provide the Forter Services, to comply with applicable law or the request of a governmental entity, in connection with certain corporate transactions, and in connection with litigation and compliance monitoring, as further described below.
We employ industry best practices and regularly commission third party audits and certifications to ensure the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data and to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access and improper use.
Full Services Privacy Policy
Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes what Personal Data Forter collects in connection with the Forter Services from End Users, how we use your Personal Data, who we share it with, how we safeguard your Personal Data, certain rights you may have with respect to your Personal Data, and how to contact us about our privacy practices.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
What type of information we collect from End Users
We collect your Personal Data when you interact with the Merchant Sites through our APIs and standard tracking technologies, as further described below. We also collect certain information from third party sources, as further described below.
1. Information provided by our Merchants
Our Merchants provide us with data and information about End Users and their interactions on their Merchant Sites through our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) (described below). Our Merchants ultimately decide what Personal Data to send to us for use in connection with the Forter Services. Our legal and product teams work closely with our Merchants to assess the scope of Personal Data that will be shared with us through our APIs, and ultimately only send such Personal Data that is necessary for us to provide the Forter Services used by a particular Merchant.
While the exact nature and scope of Personal Data sent to us by our Merchants through our APIs will vary depending on the particular Forter Services provided, Personal Data sent by our Merchants via our APIs typically includes the following:
Contact information:
this includes information such as your name, phone number, email and mailing address.
Transaction data:
this includes information about a transaction you have completed on a Merchant Site, including your name, email address, billing and shipping mailing addresses, items purchased, price paid, order status and chargeback information. We also receive basic information about your payment and billing method, but do not collect or keep your complete credit card details.
Account information:
this includes information about your account and preferences on a Merchant Site.
Browser, device and connection data:
this includes information about the personal computer or mobile device you use to access the Merchant Sites. Such information may include technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information such as the browser used to access the Merchant Site, the device model and operating system, unique device identifiers, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you accessed the Merchant Site.
2. Information we automatically collect when you visit a Merchant Site
We use standard tracking technologies (described below) to automatically collect certain behavioral, device and connection data while you are interacting with a Merchant Site.
Our Merchants ultimately decide what pages on their Merchant Sites to embed our tracking technologies. Our legal and product teams work closely with our Merchants to assess the scope of Personal Data that will be automatically collected by us through our tracking technologies, and our tracking technologies are ultimately only placed on the Merchant Sites where such placement is necessary for us to provide the Forter Services.
While the exact nature and scope of Personal Data that is automatically collected by us through our tracking technologies will vary depending on the particular Forter Services provided, Personal Data collected through our tracking technologies typically includes the following:
Browser, device and connection data:
this includes information about the personal computer or mobile device you use to access the Merchant Sites. Such information may include technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information such as the browser used to access the Merchant Site, the device model and operating system, unique device identifiers, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you accessed the Merchant Site.
Behavioral data:
this includes information regarding your activity on a Merchant Site, such as the time and frequency of access, the referrer page domain, pages viewed.
We may use the following standard tracking technologies on our Merchant Sites. Which of the below technologies a Merchant ultimately integrates with depends on the nature of the Forter Services provided.
JavaScript:
a JavaScript code is a tiny snippet of code inserted into the content of a Merchant Site. This allows Forter to collect the information described above.
Mobile SDKs:
mobile SDKs (or ‘software development kits’) are blocks of code embedded into the mobile version of a Merchant Site. This allows Forter to collect the information described above.
Information collected from third party sources
In some cases, we may combine or enhance the information we collect about you (via our APIs and tracking technologies) with information we receive from third parties. For example, we may receive information from third parties regarding the type of phone associated with your phone number (e.g., mobile or landline), geographic coordinates of your billing and shipping address, and complementary details about your phone number and address.
How we use your information and legal bases for processing
We only use End User Personal Data (i) to provide the Forter Services to our Merchants and (ii) to improve the Forter Services to provide more accurate recommendations for our Merchants. We may also use End User Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations. We never share End User Data between our Merchants.
We rely on the following legal bases to process End User Personal Data: (i) our legitimate interest in providing the Forter Services and improving the detection and prevention of fraud and abuse on the Merchant Sites; and (ii) our and our Merchants’ legitimate interest in detecting and preventing fraud and abuse on the Merchant Sites and ensuring a secure customer journey on the Merchant Sites for our Merchants and End Users.
We may also process End User Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
Automated decision-making
The proprietary machine learning technology that powers the Forter Services relies on the automated processing of End User Personal Data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to detect and prevent fraudulent and abusive behavior on the Merchant Sites. This means that our recommendations to our Merchants as to whether to approve or decline a transaction or other event on a Merchant Site as part of the Forter Services is typically made without human review or intervention. All automated decision-making by Forter is done in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
Who we share your information with
We do not rent or sell your Personal Data, or share your Personal Data with third parties, except as described below. All third party service providers we use are evaluated by both our legal and security teams prior to engagement, to ensure such providers implement and maintain appropriate measures to protect your Personal Data.
We may share your Personal Data with the following third parties:
Forter Affiliates:
we may share your Personal Data between and among Forter Ltd and its affiliates. Those affiliates are listed under “

Trusted third party service providers:
we may share your Personal Data with trusted third-party service providers that we have engaged to assist us in performing the Forter Services (e.g. data hosting providers), as necessary for such third parties to provide services to us. Prior to sharing your Personal Data with our third-party service providers, we ensure that such third parties commit to protecting the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data.
Data enrichment providers:
we may share End User Personal Data with trusted third parties (e.g., location data or identity verification providers) for data enrichment purposes. Enriching End User Personal Data allows us to make more informed recommendations about your activity on the Merchant Sites. When we share your Personal Data with our data enrichment providers, we require that such data is only used for the purpose of providing a service to us and not for any other purpose. We also ensure that such third parties commit to protecting the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data.
We may also disclose your Personal Data to third parties if we believe disclosure of such data is necessary to: (i) comply with applicable law or a request from a court, regulator, or other governmental entity; (ii) enforce our contractual rights and our policies, including in connection with investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (iv) enforce our intellectual property or other legal rights.
Additionally, we may share your Personal Data with third parties in connection with an actual or contemplated corporate transaction involving Forter, such as a merger, acquisition, divestiture, reorganization, financing or sale of our assets, as well as in connection with an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving us.

Client Privacy
Privacy Policy With Respect to Data Received From Clients
INTRODUCTION
Accertify, Inc. (“Accertify”) provides a hosted software data management tool that enables merchants to process and manage data associated with their consumer transactions. Accertify also provides other related offerings to its merchant clients. In connection with providing its services, Accertify receives personally identifiable information (“personal information”) from its merchant clients about a variety of online and offline consumer transactions (“transaction data”). This policy sets forth Accertify’s general privacy and security practices with respect to this personal information. While this policy sets forth Accertify’s general privacy and security practices, the detailed obligations and commitments of Accertify to our merchant clients is set forth in the contractual arrangements with merchant clients. In the event of a conflict between this policy and a merchant contract, the merchant contract prevails.
This policy does not describe how personal data is collected and processed by our merchant clients who obtain personal information directly from consumers. Consumers should review the privacy policies of the business entities with which they directly share their data to learn about such entities’ privacy practices.
For information about Accertify’s privacy and security practices relating to visits to the Accertify website, please review the
Accertify Website Privacy Statement
.
Accertify also has registered branch offices in Spain and Australia, as well as employees and commonly-owned affiliate entities that provide services to our clients from England, Mexico and India all of which also adhere to all aspects of Accertify’s written agreements with our clients, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”).
NATURE OF THE DATA RECEIVED
Accertify receives transaction data from its merchant clients, which generally are merchants selling goods or services on the Internet and in other card-not-present scenarios. Accertify does not conduct or fulfill consumer transactions, and, except as otherwise disclosed, Accertify does not collect or receive personal information directly from consumers. Rather, Accertify processes transaction data that consumers have provided to Accertify’s merchant clients.
Transaction data may relate to the purchase and sale of goods or services, website registration, chargeback requests, unauthorized use of a credit card or other form of payment, payment requests or other events relating to a merchant client’s website, property, or resources. This transaction data may include personal information, including but not limited to, a consumer’s name, billing address, telephone number(s), email address, IP geolocation information, device identification information, credit card number, behavioral analytics or other payment information.
The determination of which data elements a merchant client should provide to Accertify is made by the merchant client in consultation with Accertify personnel. Accertify only accepts data elements from merchant clients if the data are rationally related to the performance of the applicable service that a merchant client purchases from us. In general, Accertify does not accept data from merchants prior to execution of a definitive services agreement. Accertify advises merchant clients not to send data to Accertify in any manner that is outside of Accertify’s hosted software platform.
USE OF THE DATA RECEIVED
Accertify processes personal information to help its merchant clients prevent fraud related to card-not-present purchases, online scams, and policy abuse; address other transaction data management challenges; manage chargebacks, and obtain payment gateway services. Accertify may also process personal information received from its merchant clients to develop and provide other similar types of services to its merchant clients. For purposes of providing these services, Accertify retains records of commercial transactions and other interactions between Accertify’s merchant clients and individual consumers, which may contain personal information provided by a consumer in completing a transaction. Additional data elements may be added to the transaction record, through the use of third-party data services if those data services are elected by merchant clients. At the direction of our merchant clients, Accertify also collects information from consumers through data scripts placed on a merchant’s website.
The period for which personal information is retained is determined by the contract between Accertify and each individual merchant client and may vary based on the type of Accertify service.
However, specific elements of a transaction (such as an email address or phone number), believed to have been used in a fraudulent manner will be retained for longer periods consistent with Accertify’s agreements with its individual merchant clients. Consumers should contact the business entities with which they directly share their data to learn how long their transaction data may be retained. Accertify has put in place mechanisms to protect the accuracy and integrity of personal information.
In addition, subject to its agreements with merchant clients, Accertify may apply statistical analytics to aggregate data received from merchant clients, in order to identify patterns or anomalies that are useful in predicting the likelihood of fraud in any given transaction.
In certain cases, when agreed to by our merchant clients, Accertify may transfer transaction data from merchants to our corporate affiliates.
DISCLOSURES TO THIRD PARTIES
Accertify shares transaction data with third parties only in the following limited circumstances: (1) personal information may be accessible to third-party service providers processing data on behalf of Accertify; however, any such service providers are required by contract to implement privacy and security safeguards consistent with this policy, including the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF; (2) personal information may be disclosed to third parties as directed by the merchant client which sent the information to Accertify, including to third-party services used to validate data elements; (3) Accertify may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;  and (4) personal information may be provided to a third party to the extent Accertify enters into a transaction for the acquisition of all or substantially all of Accertify’s assets.
In addition, as part of one or more of Accertify’s discrete service offerings, such as RiskID or Accertify Index, elements of data may be retained and accessed in a limited manner by other clients of Accertify solely for the purpose of validating a consumer’s identity (specifically, to validate elements of data independently collected by such client) and only as directed by the merchant client that sent the information to Accertify. Accertify faces potential liability when we onward transfer to third parties.
EU-U.S. DPF, THE UK EXTENSION TO THE EU-U.S. DPF, AND THE SWISS-U.S. DPF
Accertify complies with the EU-U.S. Data DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Accertify has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Accertify has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Program Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit

CCPA Privacy Policy
Welcome! This is where you can learn about Criteo, the technologies and services we offer to our partners, and our data collection and privacy policies.

Our activity
Criteo helps brands, e-commerce sites and other advertisers (“Advertisers”) promote their products and services. We do that by enabling Advertisers to tailor their campaigns and/or offers to audiences that they want to reach with content that they wish to promote, which in turns means that you may receive advertising that may be of interest to you on the websites, mobile applications and other platforms of our partners (the “Publishers” or “Partners”).
How do our services work?
Criteo does not use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc.
When you browse an Advertiser’s website or mobile application that uses our technologies, that technology allows us to collect a limited amount of data relating to your browsing, such as the products you have viewed, put in your shopping cart and purchased.
Find out more about the type of data collected by Criteo
. This navigation data is linked to a unique identifier, namely an identification cookie or any other similar technology (such as mobile advertising identifiers and non-cookie technologies) depending on your navigation environment.
When you browse a Publisher’s website or mobile application that also uses our technologies, the Publisher notifies us, either directly or through an advertiser exchange, that an advertising space is available to offer you personalized advertising. The Criteo technology, working with our Advertisers, then may decide to purchase that advertising space.
The advertising you see from our partners when using our technology is based on our recommendation algorithms.
Practical example
Here is one way our technology allows us to provide you with ads that may be of interest to you:
When users visit an Advertiser website using our technologies, data relating to their browsing events are collected.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
The user with the cookie identifier 123f94d8-a745-4f8b-a1d0-bf6fbbd60058 (let’s name it “Criteo ID 123” for convenience) viewed product A on 01/01/2018 at 13:37 while browsing www.example-advertiser.com.
Our technologies compare these data with the aggregated data available on the Advertiser’s website.
Example of aggregated data available:
In general, users who purchased Product A on www.example-advertiser.com also purchased Product B on this website
In general, Product C is popular on this website
When users browse a Publisher website, we are informed of the availability of advertising spaces.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
An advertising space with the following characteristics (size, visibility, etc.) is available on www.example-publisher.com that the Criteo ID 123 is about to browse
Then our algorithms determine the relevance for buying the advertising space and displaying a personalized ad on it.
Example of decision that would be taken by Criteo: Buy the advertising space available on www.example-publisher.com and display an ad featuring the following products:
Product A, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 showed interest in it during a recent session
Product B, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 is likely to be interested in this product since he/she has viewed product A during a recent session
Product C, because this product is popular.
If you disable Criteo services, we will not display any personalized ads to you. On the other hand, the advertising space may be purchased by another company to display personalized or non-personalized ads. If you want to disable Criteo services,

Please note that the use of our technologies on our partners’ websites and mobile applications is governed by their privacy policies, which can be accessed directly from their websites and/or mobile applications. We require them to provide you with complete and appropriate information and, to the extent required by law, to obtain your consent before any of your personal information is available to us.
Our technologies are able to work in a similar fashion:
on a webpage by relying on cookies, which are supported by most web browsers;
on a mobile application by relying on the mobile advertising ID provided by mobile operating system vendors (e. g. Google and Apple);
on an browser which default settings limit the use of third-party cookies and inter-site tracking, such as Safari, if you provide consent for our services to co-exist with these default settings;
and in a transversal way between the different environments listed above. Find out more about
how our services work from one environment to another (“cross-device linking”)
.
In order to provide you with ads that are better tailored to your interests, we may receive and process audience and segments information derived from the data you accepted to share with trusted third party partners. These partners may send us information regarding your shopping habits (e.g. interested in clothing, furniture or electronics), the points of interest that are near you based on non-precise geolocation information (e.g. stores that are geographically close to you) or the products you have been purchasing in a brick and mortar store of the advertisers that are using our services to manage their online marketing campaigns. In such case, Criteo will only process geolocation information and identifiers (such as cookie IDs and Mobile Advertising IDs) that do not allow us to know who you are.
We believe that the personalization of ads is beneficial to you and the Internet ecosystem in that it contributes to the promotion of a free and open Internet by allowing Publishers to monetize the content they create, while allowing you to benefit from ads that may be more interesting to you than non-personalized ads that would be displayed to you.
Our privacy pillars
We have developed our services and technologies taking great care to respect your privacy.
Data minimisation
We undertake never to use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc. Without ever being able to identify you personally, our technologies are able to recognize your devices and/or browsers on the basis of an identifier consisting of a series of characters (identifier contained in a cookie or other). However, these data are qualified as personal data by European regulations and personal information by Californian law. As such, they are the subject of our greatest vigilance in terms of security and respect for your privacy.
Privacy by design
Our product teams develop every feature with privacy in mind; it’s the cornerstone of Privacy by Design, Criteo’s long-standing practice and commitment to ensuring industry-leading privacy, security and safety for consumers and marketers.
Key elements include:
As required by the GDPR, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer since 2013 along with a team of privacy experts.
These experts sit within the Product and R&D organization. They perform ongoing Privacy Impact Assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks.
The Data Privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces codes of conduct, and is integral to ensuring that we build best-in-class products and services.
We regularly review and document our internal policies, amend existing privacy policies as necessary, and enforce these policies with our partners and vendors.
Criteo's commitments
Our ads do not require:
To collect data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, your postal address, or your email address in plain text.
To collect sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health or sexual orientation …) to create segments or target ads to users. For the sole purpose of serving ads on a Publisher’s properties that could possibly reveal sensitive information (eg. a medical website), we may collect the URL of the website or the name of the mobile application.
To collect irrevocable identifiers, such as the hardware identifiers of the devices you use (UDID or MAC address, etc.).
To collect data related to your precise geolocation in real time.
