Privacy Overview
This is a snapshot of how 1 Second Everyday, P.B.C. treats personal information and data with the 1SE app.
Limited collection of your data
Our default position is to collect as little information as possible. We may collect and keep data about you, like your email address, location, and individual snippets only when you allow us to. We also collect non-personal data like de-identified and/or aggregated information data with our analytical partners (like Apple, Flurry, and Firebase). This is to help us build a better 1SE and provide the best experience to you. Our privacy policy has a whole section on what we collect and why, in a user friendly table. You can
view the table here
.
It's your data
If you would like to download, change, or delete your data please take a look at our step-by-step guides for
How to download your data
,
How to change your data
, and
How to delete your data
. You can also opt-out of certain uses and disclosure of your Personal Information, as described in Section 5 of our Privacy Policy.
Retain data only for as long as necessary
We don't want to hold onto personal data any longer than is needed. To help prevent this, we have a data retention schedule for various types of data we collect. This is primarily for when someone doesn't use 1SE for longer than a year. Of course, we'll make multiple attempts to notify the user before any action is taken. Our privacy policy has a friendly table that shows our data retention schedule and you can
view it here
.
Best practices for security
We take multiple steps to ensure your data is secure. First, we regularly perform security audits on our key systems. Next, access to critical systems are limited to only a few team members. Lastly, 1SE data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We'll also make sure that the other businesses we work with protect your data.
Privacy FAQ
No matter where you're located, 1 Second Everyday, P.B.C. believes in your Privacy.
Who has access to my videos, journal, and other personal data?
No one will ever access your backed up files without permission or unless required by law. Our support or engineering team will only view your data if you give us explicit permission to, for example, help in a technical support situation.
Do you monetize how I use 1SE, my videos, or any of my personal data?
Nope.
Do you listen to my videos, record without me knowing, or other creepy things without my permission?
No
Are you going to share my 1SE videos on social media?
No. You own your videos. We only share someone's 1SE video if they give us permission to do so, like for a hashtag challenge or if they have shared publicly on their social media channels. We will always ask and receive permission before sharing on our own social media channels.
Where is my data stored?
1SE uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers. These data centers are exclusively within the US right now.
How secure is my data on 1SE?
We use the same security and encryption standards as government agencies and Fortune 100 companies and limit team access to our systems using CIS20 guidelines.
Is my data encrypted?
Yes. In transit end to end using SSL and while at rest at using 256-bit AES.
Will my account be deleted after a period of inactivity?
If your account is inactive for 18 months, we will delete your account and all data associated with it. Multiple notifications will be sent to the account holder before this happens though. This is a part of our data retention policy found in our
privacy policy here
.
What can I do to take control of personalized advertisements I receive on other platforms?
You may opt-out of personalized advertisements by following the instructions for
Android
and
iOS

1 Second Everyday Privacy Policies
.
If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will post the new privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated and notify you by an in-app or website alert the first time you use the app or website after we make the change. We will consider your continued use of our Services as consent to the updated privacy policy, to the extent allowable by law.

Third-party links
This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.
2. The data we collect about you
Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It also includes information from which a device or household can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
The types of personal data we may collect (directly from you or from third-party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with 1SE and the requirements of applicable law.
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:
Identity Data
includes first name, maiden name, last name, and username or similar identifier.
Contact Data
includes account identifier, email address, and telephone numbers.
Journal Data
includes project titles, your videos, photos, moods, GPS coordinates for videos and photos, and written journal entries used to make a snippet in a project.
Social Data
includes your connections with other 1SE users, entries that you post, comments, and reactions within Crowds.
Transaction Data
includes details about purchases from you, product SKUs, other details of products, and services you have purchased from us.
Technical Data
includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.
Profile Data
includes your username and password, profile picture, purchases or orders made by you, subscription status, birthday, account preferences, feedback and survey responses.
Usage Data
includes information about how you move around our website, metrics on how you're using specific features of our products and time spent using our services.
Marketing and Communications Data
includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and your communication preferences.
We also collect, use and share
Aggregated Data
such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
We do not knowingly collect any
Special Categories of Personal Data
about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offenses. However, the content of pictures, videos, or text that you post on our website or through our service might lead someone that you share that content with to draw conclusions related to special categories of personal data. If needed, our legal bases under GDPR and UK GDPR for the processing of such images and text (e.g., the processing we do to help you make and share your videos) are performance of a contract with you, your explicit consent, and your public sharing of the data.
If you fail to provide personal data
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

Marketing/promotional offers from us
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, Profile, and Marketing and Communications Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers of ours may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us for our products, services, and offers if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
Opting out
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:
Contacting customer support at
support@1secondeveryday.com
to be removed from marketing emails; or
Logging into your account at
https://me.1se.co/
and requesting to delete your account; or
Click the "unsubscribe" option in the footer of our emails.
If you opt out of receiving marketing messages, we will still communicate with you as needed about your product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience, or other transactions.
Cookies
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
5.
Disclosures of your personal data
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the App User's Personal Data Usage Table and Website User's Personal Data Usage Table above.
External Third Parties as set out in the
Glossary
.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Note that if you share your personal data on our Site or through our Services by making public postings or sharing content such as videos or journal entries, we cannot control what other users you share that data with will do with it and even after we delete our copies of it, it may still be viewable in cached or archived pages or as copies made by users.
6. International transfers and Location of Servers
1SE is based in the United States, many of our external third parties are in the United States, our website is hosted by servers in the United States, data associated with our marketing emails is stored in Ireland and Germany, and we operate our business globally. International transfers of your data may be necessary for us to fulfil our contract with you but some countries, including the United States, may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country. If you are located, for example, in European Economic Area or Switzerland (collectively, "
Europe
"), your personal data will be transferred to the United States to our offices and our servers, which are not or may not be considered to provide an adequate level of protection under your local data protection laws. We provide appropriate protections for cross-border transfers as required by applicable law. For transfers from Europe to the United States, or other non-European jurisdictions, we have implemented the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, and other approved mechanisms to protect personal data, as required by applicable law, including obtaining explicit consent or transferring because transfer is necessary for the performance of our contract with you. You may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us.
7. Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
8. Data retention
How long will you use my personal data for?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
If you have questions about retention periods for different aspects of your personal data, please contact us at
privacy@1secondeveryday.com

Request access to your personal data
Request correction of your personal data
Request erasure of your personal data
Object to processing of your personal data

Right to withdraw consent

No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we need from you
We will use your ability to access your account or your email address as verification of your identity for allowing you to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We will need information about the kind of request you are making.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you within a month and keep you updated.
10. Glossary
LAWFUL BASIS
Legitimate Interest
means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
Performance of Contract
means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
Comply with a legal obligation
means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
THIRD PARTIES
External Third Parties
Service providers acting as processors based in the United States, Germany, and Ireland who provide IT and system administration services.
YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Your legal rights depend on where you live, but we don't want to use your personal data in ways you don't want us to. If a legal right exists for our users in one country, we may also be able to fulfil the same kind of request for users in other countries. For example, the U.K. and the E.U. give users rights to have us correct or erase your personal data. If your country does not, we will generally still try to do it if you ask us to and there's no conflict for us with some other obligation.
To make a request or exercise a legal right, contact
privacy@1secondeveryday.com
or login to the
user dashboard
.
If you live in the U.K. or the E.U., you have the right to:
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
