Your Rights
You have certain rights relating to your personal data under applicable data protection laws (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, etc.) or based on your use of our Offerings. Such rights include:
Access.
You can ask us to confirm if we are processing your personal data, provide you with details about such processing, and give you a copy of your personal data.
Erasure
. You can ask us to erase your personal data if certain conditions are met. We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal data if the processing of your personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Objection.
You can object in writing to any processing of your personal data, which is done on the basis of our “legitimate interests,” if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. If you object in writing to our processing of your personal data, we shall then have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms. In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. We will then cease the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Portability.
You can ask us to provide your personal data to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it 'ported' directly to another data controller, but only where our processing is based on your consent and the processing is carried out by automated means.
Rectification.
You can ask us to update or correct certain information; we may verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.  For certain information you may be able to update or correct information by updating your personal setting within the Offerings.
Restriction.
You can ask us to restrict (i.e., keep but not use) your personal data, but only where: its accuracy is contested (see "Rectification" above), to allow us to verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or you have exercised the right to object, and verification of any overriding grounds is pending. We can continue to use your personal data following a request for restriction where we have your consent to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims, or to protect the rights of another.
Withdrawal of Consent.
You can withdraw your consent where processing is based on a consent you have previously provided.  Your withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing done prior to your withdrawal of consent taking effect.  If you have questions about how to withdraw a consent you had provided, please complete this
form
.
Exercise of Rights.
To exercise your rights, please contact us using this
form
or using the contact details provided under the "How to Contact Us" section below. We do not discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choices and rights and will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny the Offerings to you; charge you different rates (including through penalties or discounts/benefits); provide a different level or quality of Offerings; or suggest you may receive such different treatment.  We will process any requests in accordance with applicable laws within a reasonable period of time.  In order to properly process a request we may need to verify your identity before taking any request-related actions. If needed, we will contact you via email with reasonable instructions to verify your identity before processing your request. You can appeal any decisions made regarding your rights.
Personal Data Retention
We keep your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in our notices (see "How We Use Personal Data" in the applicable notice) or, if applicable, in accordance with the relevant terms in an agreement between you and Smartsheet. We will keep your personal data longer if required for tax or accounting purposes, to ensure we would be able to defend or raise a claim, to resolve disputes, to enforce our contractual rights, or where we have a legitimate need - though we will generally not keep personal data for longer than seven years following the last date of communication with you. Where personal data is no longer required, we anonymize or dispose of it in a secure manner.
How We Protect Personal Data
We are committed to implementing and maintaining reasonable and appropriate technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal data. However, no company, including Smartsheet, can guarantee the absolute security of Internet communications. For more information on our practices, please see our
Trust Center
webpages.
Children's Personal Data
Our Site is not directed toward children under 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If you are under 18, please do not use the Site or Offerings or share personal data with us. If you learn that anyone younger than 18 has unlawfully provided us personal data, please contact us. See also our
Acceptable Use Policy
.
International Transfers
Smartsheet’s primary processing activities are in the United States, as detailed on the
Data Residency
page of our
Trust Center
. Personal data we collect will be transferred to, used, and stored in the United States or other jurisdictions in which Smartsheet, our affiliates, or service providers are located; these locations (including the United States) may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal data as the one in which you live.  By providing us with your personal data, you agree to such transfer and/or processing. Smartsheet assesses the circumstances involving all cross-border data transfers and has suitable safeguards in place to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this notice. In the event of such a transfer, we ensure that: (i) the personal data is transferred to countries recognized as offering an equivalent level of protection; or (ii) the transfer is made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as the applicable standard contractual clauses.
Data Transfer Mechanism for EU and UK Personal Data
Smartsheet relies on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses alongside the United Kingdom International Data Transfer Addendum (collectively, the “
SCCs
”) as its appropriate data transfer mechanism for EU and UK personal data. Where applicable, the SCCs are incorporated as part of Smartsheet’s standard DPA as detailed below.
Smartsheet and its affiliates participate in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("
EU-U.S. DPF
"), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("
Swiss-U.S. DPF
") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, "the
Data Privacy Framework
"). We are committed to complying with the Data Privacy Framework Principles with respect to personal data transferred to the United States from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov
. Smartsheet’s commitments under the Data Privacy Framework Principles are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements (please see our
Trust Center
for additional information). Smartsheet is and will remain liable for the processing of personal data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf (see "How We Share Personal Data" in the applicable notice). We comply with the Data Privacy Framework Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. If there is a conflict between the terms of this notice and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles will govern.
In addition, Smartsheet has implemented intercompany agreements for transfers of personal data between our affiliated companies, which require all of our affiliates to protect personal data they process in accordance with applicable data protection law. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards where legally required with our third party service providers and partners; please see our
Subprocessors
page for additional details.
Sensitive Data Collection
We do not collect Sensitive Personal Data. Sensitive Personal Data defined under the respective U.S. states (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or "CCPA") includes social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, state identification cards, passport numbers, your precise geo-location, racial or ethnic origins, religious or philosophical beliefs, union memberships, the contents of your mail and email (unless Smartsheet is the intended recipient of that content), or genetic data. We do not collect account log-ins, financial information, debit or credit card numbers in combination with your security codes or passwords. If we had any reason to collect Sensitive Personal Data, we would do so according to your rights and choices as described in the section "Your Rights" above, and with a clearly defined business purpose.
Additional State Privacy Rights
Some U.S. states, such as California, provide you more rights in addition to the rights outlined here. For more information about your specific rights in these states, see this
page
.
These rights do not remove any rights you have as described in the section "
Your Rights
" above. You may exercise these rights by contacting us as described in the section "
How to Contact Us
" below. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. We may request additional information to verify your identity, such as email verification.

We may amend, update, or revise this notice from time to time to reflect changes to our privacy practices, changing technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons. If we make any material changes that affect the way we treat your data, we will notify you by email, through the Site or Offerings, or by other legally acceptable means. We encourage you to periodically review this notice for the latest information on our privacy practices.

To Our Service Providers.
We use third party service providers to process your personal data (e.g., your contact information, billing information, account data, and device data) to assist us in business and technical operations. Smartsheet has data processing agreements with such service providers limiting their use of and access to personal data to specific purposes. They provide services relating, but not limited to fraud detection and prevention, billing, customer support, internet and connectivity, marketing (through direct mail, email, lead generation, etc.), event organizing, security, and user experience.
To Infrastructure Hosting Providers.
We use third parties for the infrastructure used to host content and personal data we process, including cloud providers. Smartsheet has data processing agreements with such service providers and their use of and access to personal data is limited to specific purposes.

affiliates

As Custom Audiences

We share a hashed (scrambled) version of your email address, name, city, state, or similar information with advertising partners to assist us in reaching you with more relevant advertisements outside of the Site (and to measure the success of such campaigns). These partners are not permitted to retain, use, or disclose this information for their own third-party marketing purposes. If you would  like to opt out of custom audiences, complete this
form
.
As Required by Law.
We disclose  information about you if we believe we must do so to comply with the law or a subpoena, bankruptcy proceeding, or similar legal process.

To Protect Rights.
We disclose information about you, such as your name, contact information, and billing information, to enforce our agreements with you or to protect the rights and safety of Smartsheet, our customers, our users, and the general public, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
As Aggregate and Anonymized Information.
We share aggregate or anonymized information about you with our third party service providers for our internal business purposes which includes marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes (e.g. we may provide information for our earnings reports, such as the number of active users.)

Plugins and Social Media Widgets.
Our Site includes social media features and widgets (“
widgets
”), such as a “share this” button or other interactive mini-programs. Widgets are used to provide you specific services from other companies (e.g., displaying the news, opinions, music, etc.). Personal data such as your email address is collected through widgets. Widgets set cookies to enable them to function properly. Widgets displayed on our Site are not hosted by Smartsheet, and are therefore subject to the privacy policies of the third party company providing the widget rather than this notice.

Privacy Notice Homepage
Scope
Our Offerings permit users to share and manage information by uploading and submitting data, images, files, or other content that can be shared, stored, and accessed through the Offerings ("
Customer Content
"). This Offerings Notice covers user account information and usage data when a user is interacting with the Offerings. This Offerings Notice does not cover Customer Content, including any personal data contained within such content, nor does it cover the use of any third party integrations with the Offerings (as discussed further below). For information relating to how we process Customer Content, please review our
Data Processing Addendum
.
Personal Data We Collect
We collect certain personal data such as account data, user profile data, and usage data in order to provide the Offerings. See this
table
for additional categories of personal data that we collect.
How We Use Personal Data
We use your personal data when we have a lawful basis to do so, and as illustrated by this
table
. For example, we use your personal data to provide the Offerings, for customer support, for personalization, for marketing, for analytics and improvement, and at your instruction.
How We Share Personal Data
We will not sell your personal data to a third party or allow a third party to use personal data we provide for its own marketing purposes. We share information about you with your consent, at your request (including when you use '
Integrations or Notifications
'), or as follows:
At Your Direction
. If you choose to use certain products and features, such as sending electronic communications from the Offerings, including but not limited to email notifications, update requests, confirmations, at-mentions or other in-application features. By using these electronic communications, your personal data (e.g., your name, your email address, and possible other personal data contained within the Customer Content being sent) will be shared with your intended third party recipients.
To Other Users of the Offerings
. Some of the features and functionality of the Offerings involve disclosure of your personal data to other users of the Offerings. For example, your name, email address, and profile image are displayed when a user views the sharing information on a container, such as a sheet, report, or dashboard; views the history details on a container (e.g., your email, access/edits, date and time stamp, etc.); or accesses your in-application profile. Organizations and other users, as Controller, control the disclosure of content with other users of the Offerings. When acting as Processor, we follow instructions from customers, including their users, with respect to how data is shared with other users of the Offerings.
To Organizational Users
. When you use the Offerings on behalf of an organization (e.g., your employer) or in connection with your organization's domain (e.g., you are registered using your employer's domain), your use is subject to our
Acceptable Use Policy
and your organization’s policies regarding the use and protection of personal data. With respect to personal data contained in Customer Content, we are processing Customer Content as a Processor on behalf of your organization, who is the Controller. As such, your organization’s system administrator has the ability to access any Customer Content, including any personal data contained therein. Smartsheet is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers. We also share personal data with your organization about your use of the Offerings that includes technical details (e.g., metadata) relating to your content or usage of the Offerings. If you have questions about how your data is being accessed or used by your organization, please refer to your organization's privacy policy and direct your inquiries to your organization’s system administrator. Please note that if you lose access to your account (e.g, change of employment), you may lose access to content associated with that account.
To an Organization.
If you use Smartsheet on behalf of an organization (e.g., your employer) or in connection with an organization's domain, that organization can: (i) access information associated with your use of the Offerings including usage and other data (e.g., who has accessed, shared, amended, created, edited, or deleted Customer Content) and the contents of the communications and files associated with your account; (ii) control and administer your account, including controlling privacy-related settings (e.g., in-app profile settings including choices relating to displaying a profile image); and, (iii) access and control content (as noted above, Customer Content is outside the scope of this Offerings Notice). If you have questions about how your data is being accessed or used by an organization, please refer to the organization's privacy policy and direct your inquiries to the organization’s system administrator. Please note that if you lose access to your account (e.g., change of employment), you may lose access to any content or data associated with that account.
To Resellers.
If you sign up for certain products or services (e.g., free trials), we will share your personal data with a Smartsheet reseller so they can contact you about our Offerings. We will disclose sharing of your personal data with resellers, and will, where required by law, obtain your consent or allow you to opt out from such sharing. If you purchase Offerings through a reseller (regardless of location), we will share certain information about your account and usage with the reseller (or their affiliate) in furtherance of their relationship with you. Resellers are independent data controllers of your personal data, a full list of resellers is available
here
.
To Payment Processors
. We use third parties (identified as Business Operations Subprocessors on our
Subprocessors
page) to assist in processing payments from customers. Smartsheet has data processing agreements with such payment processors that limit their use of and access to personal data. If you use an additional third party to facilitate your payment obligations, we will share certain usage and billing-related information about your account with such third parties for billing and business administration purposes. Payment processors are independent data controllers of your personal data, please see their respective privacy notices for more information about their privacy practices.
To Our Service Providers.
We use third party service providers to process your personal data to assist us in business and technical operations. Smartsheet has data processing agreements with such service providers limiting their use of and access to personal data to specific purposes. They provide services relating to, for example, customer relationship management, communication, fraud detection and prevention, billing, customer support, internet and connectivity, marketing, security, training, and user experience.
To Infrastructure Processors.
We use third parties for the infrastructure used to host personal data we process, including cloud providers. Smartsheet has data processing agreements with such service providers limiting their use of and access to personal data to specific purposes.
To Affiliates.
If you purchase one of our affiliates’ services through Smartsheet, we will share your personal data with the affiliate to provision and service your account.
In Transactions Involving Third Parties.
We will make services, software, and content provided by third parties available for use on or through the Offerings; if you engage with a third party provider of such features, you will be notified or otherwise made aware of personal data being shared related to those transactions with that third party.
As Required by Law
. We may disclose your personal data if we believe we must do so to comply with the law or a subpoena, bankruptcy proceeding, or similar legal process.
To Protect Rights.
We will disclose your personal data, such as your name, contact information, and billing information, to enforce our agreements with you or to protect the rights and safety of Smartsheet, our customers, our users, and the general public, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
As Aggregate and Anonymized Information.
We will share aggregate or anonymized information about you with our third party service providers for our internal business purposes, which will include marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes (e.g., we may provide information for our earnings reports, such as the number of active users).
In a Business Transaction.
If Smartsheet is involved in a dissolution, reorganization, financing, public offering of securities, merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information will be transferred to providers, advisors, accountants, attorneys, the acquiring entity, or other third parties as part of the transaction (provided that we inform such individuals that they must use your personal data only for the purposes disclosed in this notice), and will also be reviewed as part of the due diligence review for the transaction (e.g., we need to provide a list of all customer accounts and payment histories).
Integrations; Notifications; Forms; Linked Websites
Connectors and Integrations.
Our Offerings will provide access via connectors and integrations (“integrations”) to your third party accounts such as Microsoft, Tableau, Slack, or Facebook. Integrations can be used to pull and/or push information from or to the Offerings, and to enable the applicable third party to receive notifications, such as sheet updates, from the Offerings. Any information you authorize to be transferred from the Offerings to an integration is governed by the third party’s privacy statement, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any third party you authorize to receive information from the Offerings.
Sending Notifications.
Our Offerings allow you to send notifications (e.g., update requests) to other individuals through email, SMS, and other third party messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Facebook Messenger, and Microsoft Teams). You may update your preferences with respect to notification delivery through the Offerings’ personal settings. Any information you authorize to be transferred from the Offerings is governed by the third party’s privacy statement, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any third party you authorize to receive information from the Offerings.
Forms.
Our Offerings include a feature that allows users to publish online forms which allow individuals to submit data to the Offerings. While the data contained and provided by an individual is considered Customer Content and therefore not subject to this Offerings Notice, Smartsheet collects usage data (e.g., IP address, submission date and time, browser type, etc.) that could be considered personal data. For more information on what usage data is and how we use and collect it, please visit our
Privacy FAQs
.
Links to Other Websites and Third Party Content.
Our Offerings include features which allow you to link to other websites and embed (e.g., iframes) content from third party sources with privacy practices that may differ from ours. Any information you submit to a website not belonging to Smartsheet or any of its affiliates is governed by that site’s privacy statement, not this one.
Mobile Application; Geolocation Data
If you choose to download certain Offerings, for example, the Smartsheet mobile application (“
mobile app
”), we will receive additional personal data from your mobile device, in accordance with your preferences. The mobile app may have access to your device’s camera or its geographic location depending on the features you enable in the Offerings (e.g., mobile barcode scanning). Through your device settings, you have the ability to configure what functionality (e.g., your device’s camera or mobile location) the mobile app can access and we will only access this information with your authorization. The mobile app will also gather information related to your use of the mobile app (e.g., device identification, login credentials, language, and time zone); device event information (e.g., crashes, system activity, and hardware settings); and information regarding your interaction with the mobile app, which we use to provide and improve the mobile app. If you use the Offerings on behalf of an organization, information obtained by the mobile app will be accessible to your organization. For additional information about your use of the mobile app, see the
Mobile End User License Agreement
.

In addition to “Your Rights” described
here
, you have the following choices in relation to your use of the Offerings:
Closing Your Account.
If you wish to close your account, you may do so following these
instructions
or by contacting
Support
.

to access or update your account profile information.

General Questions
Is Smartsheet a data processor or a data controller?
A processor is an entity that only processes, or uses, stores, transmits, etc., personal data in accordance with the instructions of a controller.
A controller, by contrast, is an entity that determines the purposes and the means of the data processing. In other words, the controller decides why and how to process personal data. Determining what personal data is to be used for, whether to disclose the data (and, if so, to whom), and how long to retain the data are all decisions that can only be made by a controller.
An organization doesn't have to be just a controller or just a processor; it can fulfill different roles in respect to different data. For example, a cloud hosting provider may be a processor of the data it hosts for its customers but will be a controller of data about its own employees and it may be a controller of certain kinds of account data about its customers.
How does this apply to Smartsheet?
The same is true for Smartsheet. As a SaaS provider, Smartsheet acts as both a processor and a controller.
How do Smartsheet AI tools work?
Smartsheet AI tool uses large language models with your Smartsheet data, providing powerful, context-aware AI features with a focus on data privacy.
Learn more in our
AI whitepaper
and
help article
.
Is my data used to train public AI models?
We do not own your AI Data and do not use it to train public models.
Learn more in our
AI whitepaper
.
Can my organization unsubscribe from all marketing and sales communications?
Yes. Smartsheet can unsubscribe a customer account from receiving marketing and sales communications. Please have your account sys admin submit the unsubscribe request to
this form
.
Customer Content
What is Customer Content?
As covered in Section 12 of the
Smartsheet User Agreement
, “Customer Content” means any data, file attachments, text, images, reports, personal information, or other content that is uploaded or submitted to the application by Customer or Users and is processed by Smartsheet on behalf of Customer.
Who is the controller of Customer Content?
Smartsheet customers are controllers of Customer Content uploaded to the Smartsheet application. Where Smartsheet is a data processor, Customers control the data submitted and contained in Customer Content. The data processed will vary according to the Customer’s use-case.  Customers remain responsible for ensuring that submission of any special categories of Personal Data complies with applicable laws.
How does Smartsheet process Customer Content?
As covered in the
Smartsheet User Agreement
, Smartsheet may process Customer Content only: as required by applicable law; as requested by Customer in writing or as allowed by Customer via a Service’s access controls; or as necessary to provide, support, or optimize the application or prevent or address technical problems with the application or violations of this Agreement.
What subprocessors does Smartsheet utilize to process Customer Content?
Subprocessors for Smartsheet applications are documented on
this webpage
.
How can I be notified when Smartsheet adds a new subprocessor?
Customers wishing to be notified of changes to the Smartsheet subprocessor list can fill out
this form
.
Where is Customer Content hosted?
Currently, the Smartsheet platform is hosted from the United States (US) or from the European Union (EU). When customers choose the EU region as the hosting location, customer content will be processed in the EU region (Germany as primary, with backup in Ireland). For more information on data access and data transfers to the US, please refer to the
Smartsheet Trust Center
.
Where is Customer Support located?
Smartsheet's platform is web hosted and available across the globe. In order to provide support in a timely manner, Smartsheet may utilize support staff outside of the customer’s selected hosting region, and support may be provided from the US, UK, Philippines, Costa Rica, or Australia. Users may choose to access the Smartsheet application from many locations so data may be processed outside of the selected region at the direction of your users. For more information, please refer to the
Smartsheet Trust Center
.
How does Smartsheet protect Customer Content?
Smartsheet has implemented technical, organizational, and administrative measures to protect data that Smartsheet processes. Many of these measures have been reviewed by independent third-party auditors and found to meet the standards of SOC2, ISO 27001:2013, ISO 27018:2019, and ISO 27701:2019. For more information, please refer to the
Smartsheet Trust Center
.
Does Smartsheet use the data I upload to the application for marketing or sales purposes?
No. Data entered or uploaded to the application by our customers is referred to as Customer Content. Smartsheet only uses Customer Content as described in Section 2.2 of the
Smartsheet User Agreement
. Customers occasionally refer to the
Smartsheet Privacy Notice
when trying to answer this question. However, our Privacy Notice does not apply to Customer Content therefore any references in the Privacy Notice to marketing or sales activities do not apply to the data entered or uploaded to Smartsheet.
Usage Data
What is Usage Data?
Usage Data generally refers to any analytical, statistical, learned, technical, or usage information collected and processed by Smartsheet. Smartsheet collects and processes Usage Data to provide insight into how the Services are used by a customer or individual, to accurately bill customers for their use of the Services, to troubleshoot problems that arise on the network, prevent fraud and abuse, and to comply with Smartsheet’s legal and accounting obligations. We rely upon this data to run our business, secure the Services, and enable product improvements. Examples of Usage Data include, but are not limited to, diagnostic reports, page response times, and service usage metrics.
Importantly, Usage Data is not Customer Content, which is defined in the
User Agreement
.
Does Usage Data include customer data that is uploaded into the Services (i.e. Customer Content)?
No. Usage Data does not include or reveal Customer Content, including any personal data therein. Customer Content remains owned and controlled by a customer, in accordance with Smartsheet’s
User Agreement
.
Who owns Usage Data and why?
Smartsheet is the owner and controller of Usage Data because we solely determine why and how Usage Data is collected and processed. Smartsheet’s use and collection of Usage Data is subject to applicable law and limited to the purposes described in our DPA and our
Offerings Notice
. Smartsheet does not allow for customer-ownership or joint-ownership of Usage Data.
Why does Smartsheet need to be a controller of Usage Data?
Smartsheet processes service Usage Data to accurately bill customers for their use of the services, to troubleshoot problems that arise on the network, prevent fraud and abuse, pay taxes and comply with laws. We rely upon this data to run our business, secure the services and for product enhancements.
Smartsheet is a controller because we determine why and how Usage Data needs to be processed. This doesn’t mean that Smartsheet can do what it likes with your data, though: we are constrained by what the law allows and the terms of our contract with you. Smartsheet can’t, for example, sell your end-user data or process it for any reason other than what is strictly necessary for the operation of the service.
Smartsheet also determines how long Usage Data needs to be retained: once we no longer have a need to process the data for the purposes outlined above, we follow our retention practices and securely dispose of the data. So while Smartsheet needs to act as a controller of Usage Data, it is only for limited purposes and for a limited time.
Why is Usage Data collected and used?
Usage Data is collected and used by Smartsheet to provide, support, secure, and defend the Services. The insights derived from Usage Data are essential for Smartsheet’s continuous maintenance, enhancement, and improvement of the Services.
Does Usage Data stay in a customer’s selected hosting region?
As a data controller, Smartsheet transfers usage data and account information to its primary business functions in the United States from other data regions. These functions include most of our finance, marketing, sales, and support, all of which rely on usage data and account information to provide, secure, support, and optimize Smartsheet’s service for our customers. By consolidating such data and information, Smartsheet creates efficient and high-performing functions and limits the data footprint and threat vectors. Accordingly, Smartsheet doesn’t offer data residency options regarding usage data and account information. More information about data hosting can be found in Smartsheet’s
Data Residency
help article.
Is Usage Data identifiable?
Smartsheet uses Usage Data in an identifiable form or in a form that can be reasonably identifiable for its internal business purposes, including, but not limited to, account management and support services.
Does Smartsheet share Usage Data, identifiable or otherwise, with third-parties?
Smartsheet discloses Usage Data to business service providers that Smartsheet has entered into agreements with that contain appropriate confidentiality and data protection provisions. These disclosures are limited in nature and may include identifiable Usage Data if reasonably necessary for Smartsheet to perform its business functions, such as account management and support services. Except where reasonably necessary, any disclosure of Usage Data would otherwise be as de-identified or aggregate data (as those terms are generally defined under applicable data privacy laws) as to not allow any unauthorized third party from identifying a particular customer or user to which the data relates.
How is Usage Data collected?
Usage Data is collected by Smartsheet in accordance with its
Privacy Notice
.
How long is Usage Data retained?
Smartsheet determines how long Usage Data needs to be retained based on the purposes for its collection. This period may vary based on the type of Usage Data collected. Any collection of Usage Data is therefore limited to the purposes for collection and retained in accordance with Smartsheet’s data retention policies.
Can access to, or a copy of, Usage Data be requested?
Smartsheet customers can access some Usage Data in reports available within the Admin Center. For information on how System Administrators can configure the application, access reports, and manage accounts, please visit our
System Admin information page
.
Additional Usage Data may be available upon written request. Usage Data of a particular organization or customer will only be shared with an individual within the same organization or domain.
Who can I contact if I have additional questions about Usage Data?
For questions about Usage Data, please feel free to reach out to legal@smartsheet.com.
Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
Does Smartsheet sign DPAs with customers?
The terms and conditions of Smartsheet's
Data Processing Addendum
(DPA) are automatically incorporated in our
User Agreement
to meet the needs of our customers who require specific terms for the processing of Customer Content that includes personal information. Our DPA incorporates both the EU and UK Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) and has been carefully tailored to account for our subscription service's unique operational and technical controls and to address the applicable privacy obligations and legal responsibilities of both parties, particularly with respect to both the GDPR and applicable US data protection laws, such as the CCPA.
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF). For the time being, Smartsheet intends to continue to offer its DPA with the current SCCs as permitted for both new and legacy data transfers. Smartsheet will continue to monitor developments with respect to international data transfers and will make any reasonably required updates as we wait for further direction from the Commission.
What is the scope of the DPA?
Smartsheet's
Data Processing Addendum
(DPA) has been carefully tailored to account for our subscription service's unique operational and technical controls. The language in our DPA that addresses the applicable privacy obligations of both parties is in line with DPAs offered by the major service providers in the SaaS industry. The DPA has been carefully drafted to address the legal responsibilities of both parties under applicable privacy laws, particularly with respect to GDPR and CCPA, so that even customers subject to stringent privacy laws can accept the terms without negotiation. All underlying legal and commercial terms (including terms describing Smartsheet's operational practices) have already been established in the agreement governing your use of and access to the services.
Additionally, as a data processor, Customers control the data submitted and contained in Customer Content. The data processed will vary according to the Customer’s use case. Customers remain responsible for ensuring that submission of any special categories of Personal Data complies with applicable laws. Smartsheet treats all data submitted to the application the same and has built into the subscription service certain controls to account for common requirements.
What laws are considered in the Smartsheet DPA?
Smartsheet's
Data Processing Addendum
(DPA) has been carefully drafted to address the applicable legal responsibilities of both parties, particularly with respect to GDPR and CCPA, so that even customers subject to stringent privacy laws can accept the terms without negotiation. All underlying legal and commercial terms have already been established in the agreement governing your use of and access to the services and have been carefully drafted to take into account Smartsheet’s technical and operational realities as a SaaS provider.
For more information on Smartsheet’s current privacy and compliance practices, please visit our online
Trust Center
. Additionally, if you have any questions regarding Smartsheet’s existing processing activities or the data protection laws to which we can contractually commit to at this time, please feel free to review our
DPA
.
Will Smartsheet sign my organization’s DPA?
Smartsheet's
Data Processing Addendum
, the terms of which are automatically incorporated into our
User Agreement,
has been specifically tailored to depict our Subscription Service's unique operational and technical controls and our business model as a multi-tenant, data agnostic SaaS provider. In this capacity, Smartsheet treats all data from all customers the same and has built into the subscription service certain controls to account for compliance with applicable data privacy laws.
Smartsheet requires the use of its DPA because it most accurately reflects Smartsheet’s existing processes and capabilities, particularly as they relate to predominant Data Protection Laws, including the GDPR and applicable US data protection laws (such as the CCPA). While we understand that some customers may prefer to use their own DPA or supplementary data privacy terms, Smartsheet does not accept customer paper. This is designed to ensure accuracy and transparency regarding how data is transferred between the parties and processed by Smartsheet. For more information on Smartsheet's privacy practices generally, please visit the
Smartsheet Trust Center
.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
What is the GDPR?

As a data processor, will Smartsheet assist my organization in fulfilling its data subject requests?
As covered in Smartsheet's
Data Processing Addendum
, Smartsheet will provide reasonable assistance to Customer in relation to data protection impact assessments and consultations with Supervisory Authorities, taking into account the nature of Smartsheet’s Processing of Customer Personal Data and the information available to Smartsheet.
As a data controller, does Smartsheet fulfill data subject requests?
Yes, Smartsheet will comply with all legitimate and reasonable requests related to privacy rights. Please complete
this form
to submit your request to the Smartsheet Privacy Team.
What are the Standard Contractual Clauses?
The Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are a set of contractual commitments that are established by the European Commission to allow for lawful international transfers of personal data. The SCCs are meant to standardize the security and privacy practices of organizations moving personal data on individuals in the European Union (EU) outside the EU. Smartsheet executes SCCs with all vendors and our customers that require a data transfer mechanism.
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. For the time being, Smartsheet intends to operate under the current SCCs as permitted for both new and legacy data transfers. During this time, Smartsheet will be reviewing its policies and practices with respect to international data transfers and then making any reasonably required updates as we wait for further direction from the Commission.
Will Smartsheet sign Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Model Clauses?
Following the
Schrems II
decision and the invalidation of the Privacy Shield, Smartsheet updated updated its
Data Processing Addendum
to incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as the lawful transfer mechanism, the validity of which the European Court of Justice expressly upheld.
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Smartsheet intends to operate under the most recent SCCs as permitted for both new and legacy data transfers. Smartsheet will continue to monitor developments with respect to international data transfers and make any reasonably required updates as we wait for further direction from the Commission.
Are enhanced protections of EU personal data transferred to the US offered by Smartsheet?
Smartsheet has implemented technical, organizational, and administrative measures to protect data that Smartsheet processes. Many of these measures have been reviewed by independent third-party auditors and found to meet the standards of SOC2, ISO 27001:2022, ISO 27018:2019, and ISO 27701:2019. For more information, please refer to the
Smartsheet Trust Center
.
The EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)
What is the Data Privacy Framework (DPF)?
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. The decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection – comparable to that of the European Union – for personal data transferred from the EU to US companies under the new framework (replacing the Privacy Shield). To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov.
How does the Data Privacy Framework apply to Smartsheet?
Smartsheet and its affiliates participate in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the Data Privacy Framework). We are committed to complying with the Data Privacy Framework Principles with respect to personal data transferred to the United States from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov
. Smartsheet’s commitments under the Data Privacy Framework Principles are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Even though Smartsheet was not relying upon the Privacy Shield certification as a data transfer mechanism, Smartsheet maintained its existing certification, as we continued to uphold the commitments we made to the FTC and our customers about the processing of personal data under the Privacy Shield principles. As a participant in good standing, we were able to quickly transition to the Data Privacy Framework.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
What is the CCPA?
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is the first comprehensive data privacy legislation passed by a State. The CCPA went into effect in January of 2020. The law aims to outline acceptable collection, use, and storage of personal information. The CCPA also outlines transparency requirements for organizations selling personal information.
How does the CCPA apply to Smartsheet?
For more information on the privacy practices of Smartsheet, please refer to this
datasheet
.
Does Smartsheet sell personal information?
No. Smartsheet does not sell personal information. Please refer to our
Privacy Notice
for more information on how Smartsheet collects, uses, and shares personal information.
Does Smartsheet comply with other state privacy laws?
Smartsheet expects that more state laws will continue to come into effect and will continue to monitor and update its policies and practices accordingly. We expanded the definition of “Data Protection Law” under our agreements to include any federal or state data protection laws in effect and applicable to Smartsheet’s Processing of Customer Personal Data in the United States.
Integration and Forms
Why is the Smartsheet Privacy Notice included in the footer of Smartsheet Forms?
The Smartsheet application includes a feature that allows customers to publish online forms which allow individuals to submit data to the Smartsheet application. The data collected via the form and provided by an individual is considered Customer Content. As users submit forms, Smartsheet may collect usage data (e.g., IP address, submission date and time, browser type, etc.) that may be used for Analytics and Improvements; Protecting Legal Rights and Preventing Misuse; and to Comply with Legal Obligations, as further outlined in our
Privacy Notice
.
Why do the Microsoft integrations with Smartsheet ask for permission to share data to a third-party service?
Connectors and Integrations can be used to pull and/or push information from or to the Smartsheet application, and to enable the applicable third-party to receive notifications, such as sheet updates, from the application. For example, while customers are setting up integrations in Microsoft products (e.g., Outlook, Teams) they will be presented with a prompt from Microsoft (
help article
) to allow sharing of data with a third-party service. In this context, Smartsheet is the third-party service and Microsoft is requesting to share data. Additionally, any information you authorize to be transferred from the application to an integration partner is governed by the third-party’s privacy statement. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any third-party you authorize to receive information from the Smartsheet application.
Audit and Certifications
What privacy certifications has Smartsheet achieved?
Smartsheet holds certifications to two global privacy standards: ISO 27018:2019 and ISO 27701:2019. For more information, please refer to the
