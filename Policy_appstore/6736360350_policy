6. Klarna’s profiling and automated decisions that significantly affect you.
6.1 Klarna’s profiling of you as a customer.
“Profiling” means an automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal matters, for example, by analysing or predicting your personal preferences, such as buying interests. At the same time, we compare your data with what our other customers, with similar use of our services, have preferred.
The purpose of Klarna’s profiling and the personal data types used for each occasion and for each profiling are described in detail in
section 4
above. You can match the below descriptions with the purposes in section 4 above using the numbers in brackets “
[x]
”. The profiling for these purposes does not have a significant impact on you as a customer.
We use profiling for the following purposes:
to deliver our customised services, which customise their content and recommendations based on what we think is most interesting or relevant to you (this applies to the Klarna mobile application, its various functions such as the product expert and shopping assistants, when you interact with our customer service assistant and the order different payment methods appear at Klarna’s checkout), (Purposes [19, 38, 47, 50 and 57] in section 4)
to determine which is the most efficient way to contact you about your outstanding debt (looking at different channels, for example by sms or email, or the timing of such communication), (Purpose [25] in section 4) and
to deliver customised marketing to you across both our own and external platforms and services.  (Purposes [13 and 43] in section 4)
Our services utilise machine learning models and artificial intelligence models in order to provide you with as relevant content as possible.
If you have any questions about how the profiling process works, please contact us. Contact information is available in
section 12
. You may object to our marketing profiling at any time by contacting us (and we will then cease profiling for marketing purposes). You may also end our profiling for our services by terminating the service.
6.2 Klarna’s automated decisions that significantly affect you.
Automated decisions with legal effect, or automated decisions that similarly significantly affect you, means that certain decisions in our services are completely automated, without our employees being involved. These decisions have a significant effect on you as a customer, comparable to legal effects. By making such decisions automatically, Klarna increases its objectivity and transparency in the decision to offer you these services. At the same time, you have the right to object to these decisions at all times. You can read about how to object to these decisions at the end of this section 6.2. When doing these assessments we utilise machine learning models and artificial intelligence models in order to ensure as high quality as possible in our decisions.
Automated decisions that significantly affect you also mean that profiling is performed based on your data before the decision is made. This profiling is made to assess your financial situation (before the decision to offer or grant credit, or initiate a payment), to identify whether your use of our services involves a risk of fraud or money laundering or to decide whether you are liable for a purchase. We profile your user behaviour and financial standing and compare this data with behaviours and conditions that indicate different risk levels for us.
The different user behaviour and conditions are evaluated and weighted into our automated decision-models, so that we end up with a totalling score, which then results in either accepting or rejecting your use of our Services. We can also choose to request further identification from you, if we are not sure who you are.
When does Klarna take automated decisions that significantly affect you?
The personal data types used in each decision are described in section 4. You can match the below descriptions with the purposes in section 4 above using the numbers in brackets
“[x]”
.
We make this kind of automated decision when we:
decide to approve your application, or to offer you,  to use a credit service.
decide
not
to approve your application, or
not
to offer you, to use a credit service.
These automated credit decisions are based on the data you provide to us, data from external sources such as credit bureaus' credit worthiness reports, and Klarna’s own internal information about you if we have lent you money before. In addition to information about you, Klarna’s credit model includes a large number of other factors, such as Klarna’s internal credit risk levels and our customers’ general repayment rates (based on, for example, the current product category).  (Purposes [24 and 31] in section 4).
decide whether you pose a risk of fraud, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates possible fraudulent conduct, that your behaviour is not consistent with previous use of our services, or that you have attempted to conceal your true identity. Automated decisions whereby we assess whether you constitute a fraud risk are based on information you have provided yourself, data from fraud prevention agencies (see section 7.2.3. for details of which ones we use), and Klarna’s own internal information. Klarna continuously develops our fraud models to keep our services secure, and closely investigate how fraudsters operate on different markets (for example which merchant categories or products are mostly subject to fraud attempts). (Purposes [5, 21 and 41] in section 4).
decide whether there is a risk of money laundering, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates money laundering. In relevant cases, Klarna also investigates whether specific customers are listed on sanction lists. (Purposes [20, 29 and 34] in section 4).
decide whether you are liable for a purchase that you have disputed as “unauthorised” based on whether the information you provide, or we have about the purchase, point towards potential fraudulent behaviour or not. This by comparing what has happened in your case to other transactions indicating fraudulent behaviour. (Purpose [46] in section 4).
See
section 7
for more information about whom we share information with as regards profiling during automated decisions.
If you are not approved under the automated decisions described above, you will not have access to, or will not be able to use Klarna’s services, such as our payment methods. Klarna has several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate and fair. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can always contact us, and we will determine whether the procedure was performed appropriately. You can also object in accordance with the following instructions.
Your right to object to these automated decisions
You always have the right to object to an automated decision with legal consequences or decisions which can otherwise significantly affect you (together with the relevant profiling) by sending an e-mail message to
privacy@klarna.co.uk
. A Klarna employee will then review the decision, taking into account any additional information and circumstances that you provide to us.
7. Who do we share your personal data with?
When we share your personal data, we ensure that the recipient processes it in accordance with this notice, such as by entering into data transfer agreements or data processor agreements with the recipients. Those agreements include all reasonable contractual, legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure that your information is processed with an adequate level of protection and in accordance with applicable law.
7.1 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna will always share your personal information, regardless of the service you use.
7.1.1 Suppliers and subcontractors.
Description of the recipient
: Suppliers and subcontractors are companies that only have the right to process the personal data they receive from Klarna on behalf of Klarna, i.e. processors. Examples of such suppliers and subcontractors are software and data storage providers, payment service providers and business consultants, providers of machine learning/artificial intelligence functionality and Klarna Group companies.
Purpose and legal basis
: Klarna needs access to services and functionality from other companies where it cannot perform them itself. Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to access these services and functionality (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights.
7.1.2 Klarna Group.
Description of the recipient

Purpose and legal basis
: This is required for Klarna to be able to provide you with its services and functionalities. Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to access and provide these services and functionalities (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights.
When you shop in a foreign store (meaning a store located outside of the UK/EEA area) that has an agreement with another company within the Klarna Group, the disclosure of your personal information between Klarna companies is required in order for the two Klarna companies to manage your payment and enable the foreign store to administer your purchase. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract (Article 6 (1)(b) UK GDPR).
The receiving Klarna Group company will handle your personal data in accordance with the privacy notice that applies in your country (see
list
). You can read more about how Klarna safeguards your personal data when transferred outside of the UK/EEA in
Section 8

7.1.3 A person who holds a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
Description of the recipient

7.1.4 Authorities.
Description of the recipient
: Klarna may provide necessary information to authorities such as the police, financial authorities, tax authorities or other authorities and courts of law.
Purpose and legal basis
: Personal data is shared with the authority when we are required by law to do so, or in some cases if you have asked us to do so, or if required to manage tax deductions or counter crime. An example of a legal obligation to provide information is when it is necessary to take measures against money laundering and terrorist financing. Depending on the authority and purpose, the legal bases are the obligation to comply with the law (Article 6(1)(c) UK GDPR), to fulfil the agreement with you (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR), or Klarna’s legitimate interest in protecting itself from crime (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR).
There is also a requirement under UK law to withhold tax due on the payments. You will not need to do so, or take any action based on the agreement we have with the UK tax office (the HMRC), as we will disclose the necessary information to the UK tax office to support this agreement. If you have any questions regarding these arrangements, please contact the tax office.
7.1.5 Divestment of business or assets.
Description of the recipient:
In the event that Klarna sells business or assets, Klarna may hand over your personal information to a potential buyer of such business or assets. If Klarna or a significant part of Klarna’s assets is acquired by a third party, personal information about Klarna’s customers may also be shared.
Purpose and legal basis
: Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to perform these transactions (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights.
7.2 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna shares your personal information when you use Klarna’s payment methods, Klarna at a store, or choose to pay by debit or credit card in Klarna’s check-out at a store.

Purpose and legal basis:
In order for the store to be able to perform and manage your purchase and your relationship with the store or its group companies, e.g. by confirming your identity, sending goods, handling questions and disputes, in order to prevent fraud and, where appropriate, send relevant marketing. The store’s privacy notice applies to the processing of your personal data that has been shared with the store and that the store processes. Normally, you will find a link to the store’s privacy notice on the store’s website. The legal basis for sharing data with stores is partly the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR) insofar as the data sharing takes place to perform the contract between you and the store, and partly based on Klarna’s and the store’s legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR) or your consent (Article 6(1)(a) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See section 2 for more information about your rights.
7.2.2 Payment service providers, checkout providers, card networks and financial institutions.

Purpose and legal basis
: Some stores use payment service providers and check-out providers with whom they share your information for managing your payment and purchase. This sharing takes place in accordance with the stores’ or the checkout providers’ own privacy notices. The store may also let Klarna share your information with the payment service provider they use for processing your payment. Some payment service providers also receive your information from Klarna, or collect and use your information independently, in accordance with their own privacy notices or to prevent fraud. This is the case, for example, for digital wallet suppliers. In addition, Klarna may share your information with your card network and with other financial institutions when managing your payment method or conducting transactions with your account to complete the transactions. Sharing with payment service providers, checkout providers, card networks and financial institutions is performed to enable a payment method or to conduct transactions initiated by you and it is done to fulfil the agreement with you (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR).

7.3 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna shares your data when you use one of Klarna’s payment methods involving the provision of credit or when you use the Klarna card, pay with Instore, pay with Klarna through digital wallets, or the One-time Card Shopping Service.
7.3.1 Credit information bureaus.
Description of the recipient:
If you apply to use a service from Klarna that involves us providing credit (see section 4.3 on which services from Klarna involve credit), we will share your personal data with credit information bureaus. Sharing does not take place in the event of small amounts or where we already have sufficient information.
Purpose and legal basis:
Your personal information is shared with credit bureaus in order to assess your creditworthiness, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud. This data sharing constitutes a credit report.
If you apply to use a credit Service (see Section 4.1 above for a specification of our credit Services), your personal data may be shared with Credit Reference Agencies (“CRAs”) to assess your creditworthiness in connection with your application, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud.
For Klarna card, Pay Later in 30 days or Pay in 3 instalments, this sharing constitutes
soft credit searches
(or “soft credit lookups”) which does not affect your credit file nor credit score. The search is only visible to you and Klarna. In order to perform these credit searches, Klarna will send the CRAs your name, address, date of birth, phone number, as well as bank account number and sort code if relevant, in order to receive the lookups on you.
However, if you apply for one of our Financing products (fixed term loans or revolving account),
a hard credit search
(or “a hard credit lookup”) is performed in addition to soft searches. This is due to our Financing products constituting regulated credit products under UK credit legislation. This hard credit search will be recorded on your credit file and may impact your credit score as follows:
The CRA will keep a record of our enquiry against your name and which may be linked to your representatives (“associated records”). For the purposes of any application for Services from us, you may be assessed with reference to “associated records”. Where any search or application is completed, or agreement entered into, involving joint parties, we may record details about this at the CRAs. As a result an “association” will be created that will link your financial records.
Details of which CRA we have used for a specific search are available on request.
In addition, if you open an agreement with one of our Financing products, Klarna Card, Pay Later in 30 Days or Pay in 3 instalments, we will share further information on your agreement with the CRAs. This will occur on a monthly basis until the agreement is closed. This will include details of your outstanding balance, payments made and any default or failure to meet the terms of your agreement. These records will remain on the CRAs’ files for 6 years after our agreement with you is settled or terminated, whether settled by you or, if applicable, your business or by way of default. This and other information about you (or, if applicable, your business and those with whom you are linked financially) may be used to make credit decisions about you in the future.
The ways in which CRAs use and share personal data are explained in more detail at;
https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain
and
https://www.experian.co.uk/crain
. The CRAs will process your information in accordance with their own privacy notices and you can find out which ones we cooperate with

8. When can we transfer your personal data outside of the UK and the EEA, and how do we protect it then?
We always strive to process your personal data within the UK or EEA area. But in certain situations, such as when we share your information within the Klarna Group or with a supplier, subcontractor or store which operates outside the UK/EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the UK/EEA. Klarna always ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data according to the UK GDPR, even when the data is transferred outside of the UK/EEA. Your rights in respect to your personal data (described in detail in
section 2
), are not affected when data is transferred outside of the UK/EEA. More information about the recipients Klarna shares your data with you can find in
section 7
.
When you shop with a store placed in a country outside of the UK/EEA area, our sharing of your personal data with that store means that your personal data will be transferred to this country outside of the UK/EEA area.
Certain suppliers of Klarna use Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”) when they transfer personal data outside of the UK/EEA area within their own company group. Such BCR have been approved by an EU or UK data protection authority and ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data when it is transferred.
If you want more information about our safety measures you can always contact us. You can find our contact information in
section 12
. You find more information about which countries are deemed to have an “adequate level of protection” on the
European Commission’s website
, and you can read more about the European Commission’s standard clauses
here
, and about binding corporate rules (“BCR”)
here
. The Information Commissioner's Office has information about data transfers
here
.
Safety measures which Klarna uses when transferring personal data outside of the UK/EEA
Countries outside of the UK/EEA may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the UK GDPR). Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring:
if the European Commission or UK authority has decided that the country outside of the UK/EEA to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the UK GDPR. This means for example that the personal data is still protected from unauthorized disclosure, and that you may still exercise your rights in regards to your personal data, or
the European Commission’s standard clauses (with required UK addendums) have been entered into between Klarna and the recipient of the personal data outside the UK/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the UK GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country outside the UK/EEA, or
that the transfer is covered by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, with the UK extension. This is an opt-in certification scheme for US companies, administered by the US Department of Commerce. This Privacy Framework includes a set of enforceable principles and requirements that must be certified to by the US company, ensuring that your data is still being sufficiently protected.
Despite the above, if the store where you choose to shop is located in a country outside the UK/EEA, our data sharing with that store (and with the Klarna entity that store has contracted with) means that your personal data will be transferred to and processed in this country outside the UK/EEA. Click
here
to access the privacy notices for other Klarna entities in the Klarna Group. Otherwise it would not be possible to administer your purchase. Klarna primarily relies on the European Commission’s standard clauses (with required UK addendums) to ensure the protection of your personal data for such data transfers, but as set out above, countries where the foreign store is located may have laws preventing the efficient protection by the standard clauses. Even if this is the case, your personal data will still be transferred to the foreign store (or the foreign store’s local Klarna entity), as long as the data transfer is necessary to administer your specific purchase.
9. How long we store your personal data
How long Klarna stores your personal data depends on the purposes for which Klarna uses the personal data:
Personal data used for the contractual relationship between you and Klarna is generally stored for the duration of the contractual relationship and thereafter for a maximum of up to 10 years based on statutes of limitations rules.
Personal data that Klarna is under a legal obligation to retain, for example under anti-money laundering laws or bookkeeping laws, is generally retained for 5 and 7 years respectively.
We process the recordings of telephone conversations for a time period of 90 days for quality assurance purposes. We will also retain recordings of inbound and outbound calls for up to three years, as well as Klarna employees’ notations from these calls for up to six years, in order to document what has been discussed and decided on the call.
Personal data which is not used for the purposes of your contractual relationship with Klarna or where Klarna does not have a legal obligation to retain the data is only retained as long as necessary to fulfil the respective purpose for our data processing (usually 3 months). More information can be found in the table in
section 4
.
In some limited cases, the personal data may need to be stored for a longer period because of capital adequacy laws which Klarna has to comply with.
The legal obligations referred to above means that Klarna cannot delete your personal data, even if you request us to delete it, as described in
section 2
. If we don’t have a legal obligation to retain the personal data, we instead have to make an assessment if we may require the personal data in order to protect Klarna from legal claims.
Please note that just because we have a legal obligation to store your personal data, this does not mean that we are also permitted to use this data for any other purpose. Klarna will make an assessment for each specific purpose of how long we may use your personal data. You can read more about this in
section 4
.
10. How we use cookies and other types of tracking technology
To provide a tailored and smoooth experience, Klarna uses cookies and similar tracking technologies in our multiple interfaces, such as our website, the Klarna mobile application and at the checkout of a store that uses Klarna.

11. Updates to this Privacy Notice
