Last Modified: February 12, 2025
The following are the terms and conditions for use of Apryse Software Inc.’s (“

”, and “
our
”) Xodo website and services (the “

”). Please read them carefully. BY USING THE SERVICES OR CLICKING ON THE "I AGREE" BUTTON, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OF USE (the "
Terms
"). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.
1. YOUR ACCOUNT
An Apryse account gives you access to the Services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of users. The different account types allow users to work within different features, and file number limitations. Our Services user types are as follows:
Not registered
Xodo Free (for web)
Xodo Pro (for web)
Xodo PDF Studio (for desktop)
Xodo Document Suite (cross platform)
Users are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on their account and must keep their account password confidential and secure. You shall notify Apryse immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. Apryse will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by Apryse or another party due to someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else’s account at any time. In the event that access to your account is suspended or terminated, Apryse shall not be liable to you or any third party for suspension or termination of your account.
By subscribing for Xodo Document Suite, users will also get access to Xodo applications which are downloadable onto desktop and mobile devices and the full suite of available features within those applications. Note that a separate account for such applications will need to be created, which can be linked to the Xodo Document Suite account. Use of the Xodo applications on desktop and mobile devices will be governed by a separate set of terms which can be found on the application store for the relevant device.
2. USE OF THE SERVICE AND USER CONDUCT
Any actual or attempted commercial use of any Services by you, such as charging or attempting to charge third parties a fee to convert the third parties' documents by running them through the Services or reselling Services accounts to others, is expressly prohibited. You may use the Services for your personal needs or, if you have a Xodo Pro, Xodo PDF Studio or a Xodo Document Suite account, your internal business needs. For clarity, ‘internal business needs’ means the use of the Services for the benefit of your organization's internal operations and work environment. You agree that your use of the Services will at all times comply with all applicable local, provincial, state, federal, national and international laws and regulations, and that you are solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur under your account, including the content of documents you submit to the Services for conversion, editing or viewing. Apryse is not obligated to provide any technical support for your use of the Services. The terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time are incorporated into these Terms by reference and apply to the Services. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any message or information you send using the Services may be read or intercepted by others.
(i) Restrictions on Use
You agree not to attempt to decompile, disassemble, modify, reverse engineer or translate the software used within the Services or otherwise attempt to learn the source code of any software or Services we provide to you. You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, format, or create derivative works of any technology used to provide the Services.
Furthermore, the following actions are prohibited while using the Services or functionality we provide to you as part of the Services:

(ii) Age Restrictions
You may only use the Services if you are 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your home jurisdiction to lawfully enter into and form contracts in accordance with applicable local laws) or older, or if you are underage, if a verifiable parental or authorized guardian consent and agreement to these Terms for your use of our Services has been provided to us. If you are a parent and you learn that your child is using our Services and you don’t want them to, please contact us.
3. DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, DURABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THAT STORED DOCUMENTS WILL BE PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. WHILE APRYSE ATTEMPTS TO ENSURE YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES IS SAFE, APRYSE CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ITS SERVER(S) ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH, SO THEY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE DISCLAIMERS DO NOT OVERRIDE THE LEGAL PROTECTIONS (INCLUDING ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES) THAT ARE GRANTED TO CONSUMERS BY THE LAWS OF THE EU.
APRYSE DOES NOT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT ITS LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR APRYSE’S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE EXCLUSIONS BELOW ARE NOT ALLOWED, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE OR OUR BREACH OF THE TERMS. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT.
IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, IN NO EVENT SHALL APRYSE OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, AND AGENTS ("
APRYSE PARTIES
"), BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF INFORMATION), ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, INABILITY TO USE OR RELIANCE UPON THE SERVICES, EVEN IF APRYSE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
INDEPENDENT OF, SEVERABLE FROM AND TO BE ENFORCED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER ENFORCEABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISION OF THE TERMS, IN NO EVENT WILL APRYSE PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU (INCLUDING LIABILITY TO PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARE BASED ON OR DERIVED FROM A RIGHT OR RIGHTS CLAIMED BY YOU), WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE TERMS, THAT EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTH PERIOD, OR USD $10.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO EU CONSUMERS WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES WILL APPLY TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION AND WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGARDLESS OF THE SUCCESS OR EFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER REMEDIES.
4. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify and hold Apryse, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, harmless of and from any claim, demand, or damage, including reasonable attorneys' fees, asserted by any third party due to or arising out of your content or your use of or conduct with regard to the Services.
5. MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION
Apryse reserves the right to discontinue offering all or part of the Services or to modify the Services at any time, without any liability to you or anyone else in its sole discretion. For changes to paid offerings that, in Apryse’s reasonable discretion, result in a material diminishment of value to you, we will make reasonable commercial efforts to notify you of such modification or discontinuation. If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the Services at any time, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using the Services. Apryse in its sole and exclusive discretion, may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if: (a) you violate the Terms either in letter or in spirit; (b) If you fail to make timely payments of fees for the Services; (c) if we are required to do so by law (for example, if providing software to a specific region becomes unlawful); and (d) if we choose to discontinue the Services, in whole or in part (such as if it becomes impractical for us to provide Services in your jurisdiction). If you are a user of a free account, Apryse may terminate the Services with or without cause upon 30 days’ notice to you. Upon termination of the Services, your right to use the Services immediately ceases. If we discontinue any Services in its entirety, then we will provide you with a pro rata refund for any unused fees for the discontinued Services that you may have prepaid. Termination of your account shall not relieve you of any obligation or liability accruing prior to such termination, nor preclude Apryse from pursuing all rights and remedies it may have under these Terms, at law or in equity, with respect to breach of these Terms.
6. CHANGES TO TERMS
Apryse reserves the right to change the Terms at any time and to notify you by posting an updated version of the Terms on the website or other reasonable means as Apryse deems appropriate. If you do not agree to these changes, then you must stop using the Services. If you do not stop using the Services then your use of the Services will continue under the changed terms. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by all of these Terms as amended by us from time to time.
7. SANCTION AND EXPORT RESTRICTIONS
Any use of the Services shall be in compliance with all relevant international, U.N., Canada, USA or EU sales, export or import restrictions and regulations and you agree to comply with them. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to embargo, or that has been designated by the United States as a “terrorist supporting” country; and that you are not listed in any Canadian, United States or EU sanction list of prohibited or restricted parties and you comply with relevant sanctions and embargos.
8. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws (procedural and substantive) of California as if made and performed by and between parties situate in such jurisdiction and without regard to any conflict of laws doctrine. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any part of any transaction which may result from these Terms and the same is strictly excluded from these Terms. You and Apryse submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Santa Clara County, California and waive any objection as to venue in such courts. Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Apryse may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for interim or injunctive relief pending resolution of the dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries (including those in the EU) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This section does not override such laws.
9. BILLING AND RENEWAL
If you decide to purchase a paid subscription to any of the Services (or any particular features of the Services), you will be charged the stated fee in advance on a monthly or yearly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase. We may change the price for the paid subscription, including recurring subscription fees (for periods not yet paid), from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you at least 30 days in advance. Such notice may be provided by an email to you or in the form of an announcement on the Service. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Services after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you may reject the change by unsubscribing from the paid subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
We will automatically bill the subscription fee to your plan, price and payment method selected until your subscription is cancelled or terminated. If you do not terminate your subscription, it will be automatically renewed. You and Apryse may cancel or terminate your subscription at any time. Any cancellation will take place from the next billing period, i.e. any cancellation will only cancel future billings. We do not provide refunds except in cases requested by mandatory law or where otherwise explicitly communicated to you.
10. OWNERSHIP OF IP
We (and our licensors) remain the sole owner of all right, title, and interest relating to or embodied in the Services, including all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto. We reserve all rights not granted under these Terms. We may use feedback you provide in connection with your use of the Services as part of our business operations without any obligation or restriction of any kind. Further, all graphics, logos, domain names, trademarks and trade names relating to the Services (collectively, the “
Marks
”) are the property of Apryse and its licensors. Apryse and its licensors retain all rights, title and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Marks. You are prohibited from using any of the Marks.
We do not claim any ownership rights to your content.
11. USE OF E-SIGNATURE FEATURES
Certain types of documents or agreements may be excluded from general electronic signature laws (for example, wills, trusts, court orders, or family law matters), or may have specific regulations that are applicable to them. You are solely responsible for ensuring that the documents you use with the Services are appropriate for electronic signatures, and Apryse is not responsible or liable for any such determination or use.
Consumer protection laws or regulations in some jurisdictions may impose specific requirements for electronic transactions involving consumers; you are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with all such laws or regulations and Apryse has no obligations to make such determination or assist with fulfilling any such requirements.
12. FILE STORAGE
If file storage is provided, the following terms will apply:
Apryse uses TLS encryption. Apryse shall have in place and shall comply with documented written policies and procedures, periodically reviewed, covering the administrative and technical safeguards in place and relevant to the access, use, loss, alteration, disclosure, storage, destruction and control of information. Such policies and procedures will include encryption of data in storage and in motion over public networks, virus detection and firewall utilization. Furthermore, users’ information is stored with logical separation from information of other customers.
Apryse shall not access users' stored files, except to respond to service or technical problems or at users' request or except as compelled by law.
In the event of unauthorized access to your files, Apryse will endeavour to promptly notify you of such unauthorized access.
Upon request made within 30 days after the effective date of termination of your use of your account, Apryse will make available to you for download your files in their native format. After such 30-day period, Apryse shall have no obligation to maintain or provide any files and shall thereafter, unless legally prohibited, delete all files in its systems or otherwise in its possession or under its control.
13. MISCELLANEOUS
13.1. Event Outside Our Control.
We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under these Terms that is caused by any act or event beyond our reasonable control, including failure of public or private telecommunications networks.
13.2 Assignment.
We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation without consent. You may only assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.
13.3 Waiver and Severability.
The failure of Apryse to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
13.4 Entire Agreement.
These Terms and our Privacy Policy are the entire agreement between Apryse and you regarding the use of the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Apryse and you regarding the same. Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 6 (Changes to Terms), no amendment to or modification of these Terms will be binding unless in writing, signed by an authorized senior executive of Apryse, and expressly referring to these Terms.
13.5 Interpretation.
The headings to, and the division of these Terms into Sections, Subsections, Paragraphs, and Subparagraphs are for ease of reference only and will not in any way affect or be used in interpreting any of the provisions of these Terms. Unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to a Section, Subsection, Paragraph, Subparagraph or Schedule by number or letter is a reference to the appropriate Section, Subsection, Paragraph, Subparagraph or Schedule in these Terms. In these Terms, the singular of any term includes the plural and vice versa and the use of any term is equally applicable to any gender and where applicable to a corporate entity; and the conjunction “or” will be understood in its inclusive sense (and/or).

.
The information collected cannot typically be used to identify you personally. However, if you have specifically informed us of your identity (for example by registering for something or providing us with your contact information), it may be possible for us to link certain information to information that identifies you personally.
3.2.2. Digital Markers (including Cookies), Online Tracking Technologies, Online Interest Based Advertising
A digital marker is created by a website visitor’s Internet browser to maintain certain pieces of information for the website to reference during the same or subsequent visits. Examples of digital markers are cookies or HTML5 Web storage. Among other things, digital markers can allow a website to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the website, and track what information is viewed on a website.
We use sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of our websites. Digital markers are created when you visit our websites. Sessional markers exist while you remain on our websites, and persistent markers continue to exist after you have left our websites.
For information on the digital markers (including cookies) we use and the purposes for which we use them see the applicable Cookie Notice for the Apryse website(s) you may visit.
Similarly, we or our third-party service providers/advertisers may also use "web beacons", "pixel tags" or other tracking technologies, which are typically small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor behaviour and collect certain data regarding the actions of our visitors online.
These digital markers and other technologies may be used to track across time, sites, and devices. For example, these technologies can be used to analyze your online traffic patterns, to enhance your experience when using our products, to store information during your session, to personalize our websites for you based on your preferences and selections, to target advertising or content to you (as described further below), and to collect information about you and your usage of our websites or apps for other marketing and business purposes. You may adjust your privacy preferences regarding the use of digital markers, including cookies, and similar technologies through your browser. However, disabling cookies may impair your user experience and disable certain features of our websites.
Data about your activities online may be collected for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests, either by us, or third parties. We may work with third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content.
We and these third-party vendors, including Google and LinkedIn, may use third-party technologies (such as the LinkedIn Insight Tag) together with our own first party technologies in order to analyze ad impressions, your use of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services. The information collected may also include information about your visits to our websites, include the pages you have viewed and what content you have seen. These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.

5. HOW IS PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA LAWFUL?
We are allowed to process your personal data based on the following legal bases:
Legitimate Interests
– We are permitted to process your personal data if it is based on our ‘legitimate interests’ i.e. we have good, sensible, practical reasons for processing your personal data which is in our interests as set out in the section above. To do so, we have considered the impact on your interests and rights, and have placed appropriate safeguards to ensure that the intrusion on your privacy is reduced as much as possible.
You can object to processing that we carry out on the grounds of legitimate interests. See the section headed "Your Rights" to find out how.
Contract
– It is necessary for our performance of the contract you have agreed to enter with us. If you do not provide your personal data to us, we will not be able to carry out our obligations under the terms of your contract.
Legal obligation
– We are subject to legal obligations to process your personal data for the purposes of complying with applicable regulatory rules and to make mandatory disclosures to government bodies and law enforcement agencies.
Consent:
If you use our websites and products with our UK and European companies: sometimes we want to use your personal data in a way that is entirely optional for you, such as when you give consent for us to place cookies on your device or when you subscribe to our newsletter. On these occasions, we will ask for your consent to use your information. You can withdraw this consent at any time.
If you use our websites and products with our Canadian companies: by using our products and providing personal data to us, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data as specified in this notice. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your personal data in specific circumstances, in which case we may ask for your consent in writing (including by electronic means) although in some circumstances we may accept your oral consent. Sometimes your consent will be implied through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily provide the information.
For any other jurisdictions where consent may be required, we will obtain your permission in accordance with applicable laws.
6. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
We may share your personal data with any member of our corporate group, which means our subsidiaries, our parent company and its subsidiaries.
We do not sell or rent personal data to marketers or unaffiliated third parties. We may share your information with selected third parties including:
Our other group companies, business partners and suppliers when this is necessary to provide our services to our users or for the performance of any contract we enter into with you;
advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. Such disclosures are typically aggregate information about our users and analyses of our server logs, traffic, or information relating to customer leads, including details regarding usage of our websites or apps and general information about our audience, and are not generally considered to be personal data;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our products;
our service providers who provide certain services on our behalf such as data hosting or processing services. We will use contractual arrangements to protect personal data disclosed to these service providers;
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets or (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process, in accordance with applicable law;
if Apryse or substantially all of its assets (or any group company or its assets) are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers and users of its products will be one of the transferred assets, in accordance with applicable law;
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or as we believe in good faith may be reasonably necessary to comply with any law, regulation, rule, court order, or other lawful requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities (including in response to law enforcement or national security requirements), or in order to enforce or apply any terms of use applicable to a specific product, and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Apryse, our customers, or others;
as otherwise may be required or permitted by applicable law.
7. WHERE DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND HOW DO WE KEEP IT SECURE?
7.1 WHERE DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
Apryse is based in Canada, other group companies are based in other jurisdictions, including in the US, New Zealand, Europe and the UK. The information (including any personal data) we collect is transferred, maintained, stored, and processed in Canada, the US, Europe and the UK and other countries outside Canada where our or our service providers’ facilities may be located. Regardless of where you are located, we carry out these transfers in compliance with applicable laws.
If you are based in Canada, you understand and agree that we may store and process the information you provide to us in Canada and other countries. The data protection and privacy laws in those countries may offer a lower level of protection than the data protection and privacy laws of your country. Also, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in Canada and foreign countries according to their laws.
If you are located in the UK, European Economic Area or Switzerland, your personal data is transferred outside of the UK, European Economic Area or Switzerland in order for our service providers to provide their services to us. The data protection and privacy laws in those other countries may offer a lower level of protection than the UK and European data protection laws. We ensure that we put mechanisms in place in order to transfer your personal data securely and in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If you want to know more about our international transfers, you can contact us.
7.2 IS MY PERSONAL DATA SECURE?
We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access and any other unlawful forms of processing. We aim to ensure that the level of security and the measures adopted to protect your personal data are appropriate for the risks presented by the nature and use of your personal data. Among the steps we take in order to protect your information are:
premises security;
restricted file access to personal data;
deploying technological safeguards like security software and firewalls to prevent hacking or unauthorized computer access; and
internal password and security policies;
Unfortunately, no transmission of information via the internet or storage of information is completely secure. Although we take commercially reasonable steps to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites or apps that we store.
7.3 RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA
Personal data will be retained in accordance with this notice for as long as may be necessary or relevant for the purpose of collection, or as may be required or permitted by applicable law, after which time it may be made anonymous or destroyed unless you further consent to its continued retention.
7.4 INTEGRATED SERVICES
You may be given the option to access or register for our products through the use of your username and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an "
Integrated Service
"), such as through the use of your Google account, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal data or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), and basic profile information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this notice. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand what information that Integrated Service makes available to us, and make any changes you deem appropriate before you submit any personal data to them. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our apps.
8. THIRD PARTY LINKS
Our websites and apps may, from time to time, contain links to and from third party websites including those of our partner networks and advertisers. If you follow a link to any of those websites, please note that they have their own privacy notices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those notices. Please check these notices before you submit any personal data to those websites.
9. YOUR RIGHTS
You may have the following legal rights under the applicable data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You can exercise these rights free of charge, by contacting us (please see "Contact Us"). We will respond to any rights that you exercise within a month of receiving the request unless the request is particularly complex, in which case we will respond within three months.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Please be aware that there are exceptions that apply to some of these rights, which we will apply in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Your data protection rights
What does this mean?

You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal data and what your rights are. This is why we are providing you this privacy notice.
Right of access
You have the right to obtain access to your personal data we process and certain other information (similar to that provided in this privacy notice).
You may ask for:
A copy of your information,
Details about why and how we process your personal data,
Whether we carry out any automated decision-making or profiling, and where we do information about the logic involved and the outcome or consequences of that decision or profiling.
To help us find the information, please give us as much information as possible about the type of personal data you would like to see.

Rights in relation to automated decision making
These rights are not applicable as we do not carry out any automated decision making.

You do not believe that we need your data in order to process it for the purposes set out in this privacy notice;
If you had given us consent to process your data, you withdraw that consent and we cannot otherwise legally process your data;
You object to our processing and we do not have any legitimate interests that mean we can continue to process your data; or
Your data has been processed unlawfully or have not been erased when it should have been.

You do not think your data is accurate. We will start processing again once we have checked whether or not the data is accurate;
The processing is unlawful but you do not want to erase your data;
We no longer need the personal data for our processing, but you need the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or

Right to object to processing
You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing based on our legitimate interests and processing for direct marketing.
Right to withdraw consent

Please contact us if you wish to withdraw your consent to anything we do with your personal data.
In order to exercise these rights, you may contact us as described in the Contact Us section below. We will comply with your request to the extent required by applicable law. If you feel that you have not received a satisfactory response from us, you may consult with the data protection authority in your country. In the UK, you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Information about how to do this is available on its website at
www.ico.org.uk

Tool Privacy
Most of our tools process your files entirely within your browser. This means that your file will never leave your own computer, meaning
no one has access to them except you

However, some tools require processing that is not possible within the browser, so we temporarily upload them to a server. Once they are processed, the file is removed from the server
after approximately 1 hour
. This ensures total privacy for all of your files, even for tools that upload them.
You can find a list of all tools below, and information about how your files are processed:
