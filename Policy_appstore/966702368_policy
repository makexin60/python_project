Public Content – Product Photos, Data and Other Public Information:
Our Services are primarily designed to help you track and manage your groceries. Our product database is in part crowd-sourced and most of the product information you provide us is information you are asking us to share with other users of the Service. This includes not only the photos and factual data of products (names, brands, ingredients, etc.), but also product ratings, reviews, etc. that result from your use of the Services. We may use this information to customize the content we show you and other users, including product offers or ads. Our default is almost always to make the product information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Pantry Check. Our Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. When you share information or content like photos via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
Tip:
When you submit grocery product photos and factual information to Pantry Check (for example: product names, brands, manufacturers, nutrition information, ingredients, etc.), it may be viewed all around the world instantly.
Private Content – Pantry Information:
You may provide us with your “Pantry Information” such as your product item inventory, product usage data, expiration alarms, preferences, favorites, grocery and other lists, search terms, automated scanner picture captures. We organize this information in your Pantry. A Pantry may have one or more Pantry Check users as members and only members of the Pantry control its member list. By default you are the only member of your Pantry. The Pantry Information may be directly visible only to the users that are members of the corresponding Pantry.
We may use your Pantry Information to provide additional services to you and members of your Pantry, customize the content we show you, including product offers.
We may earn commissions on product offers we refer you to purchase through services of our affiliates. For example, when you view olive oil on Pantry Check and we display a link to olive oil products on a third-party website, like Amazon, and you follow that link and make a purchase, we may earn commission fees.
Tip:
The Pantry Information like household inventory, product usage history, grocery lists, etc. is private and directly visible only to you and members of your Pantry. We may use it to provide you with additional services. We may use it to show you product offers or ads.
Location Data:
You may choose to provide us with your device approximate or precise GPS location data.
We use Location Data to provide additional services to you such as automatic grocery store look-up.
We do not store Location Data, except in cases where Location Data may be captured as part of Log Data, see section on “Additional Information We Receive About You” > “Log Data” section in our Privacy Policy.
Derived Data:
We may use your Optional Account Information, Public Content and Private Content (for example: product item inventory, grocery lists, prices, expiration dates, alarms, etc.), to derive
aggregate anonymized data – “Derived Data”
that is not directly traceable to you and does not include Personal Identifiable Information. We may use the Derived Data to provide additional Pantry Check services to you and other users as well as share it with our affiliates. We may provider or sell analytics services that are in-part or wholly based on Derived Data, to third parities and affiliates.
Tip:
Pantry Check may generate anonymized
Derived Data
that is not directly traceable to you and does not include Personal Identifiable Information. Some examples of Derived Data are grocery item prices, availability, popularity, shelf life and expiration dates, trends, etc.

Pantry Check may use that Derived Data to provide additional Pantry Check services to you and other users and share that Derived Data with Pantry Check’s partners and affiliates. We may also provide and or sell analytics services powered by Derived Data to third parties and affiliates.
