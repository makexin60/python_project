6. Interest-based advertising
We would like to suggest the movies that best suit your personal taste and show you where you can watch them. What we do, provided you have given us your consent: to personalize your experience, we collect, process and store your interactions with our website. This allows us to send you tailored or interest-based advertisements that are optimized for your profile. These ads may be displayed on JustWatch as well as on other websites you visit or apps you use (using retargeting technology). They may also be delivered in emails. If you do not give your consent, we will still show you ads on our website, but they will not be personalized.
In general, all your data is collected in anonymized or pseudonymized form, but we may also collect personal data for explicitly defined use cases. Subject to your consent, we process certain data with the help of third parties and share your data with our business partners. More details on this can be found below.

What we don’t do: we never collect sensitive information such as financial data. We never sell user-level information (e.g., “What movie titles did a particular user click on?”) unless it is in aggregate form (e.g. “What titles are popular with users?”).
7. Affiliate links
On our website, we include so-called affiliate links or other references (which may include, for example, search masks or widgets) to offers and services from third-party providers. If you click on the affiliate links or subsequently take advantage of the offers, we may receive a commission or other benefits from these third parties.
To be able to track whether you have taken advantage of the offers of an affiliate link that we have included, it is necessary for the respective third-party provider to learn that you have clicked on an affiliate link on our website. The assignment of the affiliate link is for commission accounting purposes only and will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In order to assign affiliate links, these can be supplemented by certain values that comprise a component of the link or that can be stored elsewhere, e.g. in a cookie. These values may include, in particular, the source website (referrer), the time, an online identifier of the operator of the website where the affiliate link was located, an online identifier of the respective offer, the type of link used, the type of offer and an online identifier of the user.
If you have given us your consent to use a third-party provider, the legal basis for the data processing is art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. However, the use of a third-party provider may also form part of our (pre)contractual services, in which case the legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.

Google Ads makes it possible to define the visitors to our website as a target group for the display of ads. We use Google Ads to display the ads that we place only to those users who have also shown an interest in their content (e.g. interest in certain movies and series).
Remarketing function allows us to present users of our website with interest-based ads on other websites within the Google advertising network (in Google Search or on YouTube, so-called "Google Ads" or on other websites).

Firebase supports our login process by processing so-called “instance IDs”, which include a time stamp. These IDs are assigned to a specific user and allow the linking of different events or processes. This data does not allow us to draw any conclusions about the specific user.

We use Floodlight to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, to limit the frequency with which you are shown a certain ad and to only display ads that are relevant to you and your interests. In particular, information about the ads you have clicked on, as well as your previous usage behavior on third party websites, is collected and stored. Google uses a cookie ID to record which ads are displayed in which browser and can thus prevent them from being displayed more than once. In addition, Google can use cookie IDs to record so-called conversions that are related to ad requests.

12. Social Media
12.1 Facebook
We have a so-called fan page on the “Facebook” social network and process user data in this context. We also use Facebook pixels on our website. The service provider is Facebook Inc, 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025; Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland.
We use our fan page to provide information about JustWatch and to communicate with users active there via the network. Furthermore, data may be processed through the use of Facebook for market research and advertising purposes. This is carried out, for example, on the basis of tracking, where interest- or behavior-based profiling or cookies may be used, among other things. However, remarketing and reach measurement are also used, for which purpose access statistics - which recognize returning visitors - are created, for example.
In this context, the following types of data may be processed: inventory data and contact data (e.g. name, address, email, telephone number), content data (e.g. entries in online forms, use of the message function), usage data (e.g. access to websites, clicks, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
With the help of the Facebook pixel (or comparable functions, for the transmission of event data or contact information by means of interfaces in apps), it is possible for Facebook to define the visitors to our online offer into a target group for the display of ads ("Facebook ads"). We use the Facebook pixel to display the Facebook ads that we place only to those users on Facebook and within the services of partners cooperating with Facebook (“
Audience Network
”) who have also shown an interest in their content (e.g. interest in certain movies and series) and transmit this information to Facebook (“Custom Audiences”). The Facebook pixel also helps us to make sure that our Facebook ads correspond to your potential interest and are not a nuisance. In addition, the Facebook pixel allows us to track the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, because we can see whether users were redirected after clicking on a Facebook ad (“conversion measurement”).
In this context, the following types of data may be processed: content data (e.g. entries in online forms, use of the messaging function), usage data (e.g. website access, clicks, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), and event data (Facebook). Event data includes, for example, visits to websites, interactions with content, installations of apps and purchases of movies. Event data is processed to create target groups for content and advertising information (Custom Audiences). Event data does not include specific content (such as comments written), login information, or contact information (e.g. names, email addresses, and phone numbers). Event data is deleted by Facebook after a maximum of two years.
With regard to data processing on our Facebook fan page and through the Facebook pixel, JustWatch GmbH and Facebook Ireland are joint controllers according to art. 26 GDPR. The legal basis for the processing of personal data is art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can assert your data subject rights with Facebook directly as well as with us. The primary responsibility under the GDPR for the processing of data lies with Facebook and Facebook fulfills all obligations under the GDPR with regard to the processing of data. You can view the joint processing agreement
here
. You can find Facebook's security terms
here
. When Facebook provides us with metrics, analytics, and reports (which are aggregated, i.e. without information on individual users and anonymous to us), this processing is not carried out under shared responsibility, but is based on a processing agreement, which you can view
here
.
We, as the operator, do not make any decisions regarding the processing of Insights data and any other information resulting from art. 13 GDPR, including legal basis, identity of the controller or storage period of cookies on user terminals.
The standard contractual clauses of the European Commission apply to the transfer of data to Facebook with the addition of the Facebook EU Data Transfer Supplement, available at
https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum
.
Although Facebook Ireland is the data controller according to the Facebook EU Data Transfer Supplement, we would like to point out that it cannot be ruled out that the information collected by the cookies will be sent to a Facebook server in the United States of America (USA) and stored there. In the USA, there is no equivalent to the general adequacy decision of the European Commission certifying an adequate level of data protection. By transmitting your personal data, there is a risk that US authorities will access and process it for their own purposes.
Please note that it is possible to link the data with other data (sometimes also on other devices). This risk exists in particular if you have a Facebook account and are logged in to Facebook. To avoid further data linking, we recommend that you log out of Facebook before visiting our website.
The legal basis for this processing and the transfer of your personal data to the USA is your consent pursuant to art. 6 (1) (a) and art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR. You have the option to withdraw your consent at any time
here
.

12.2 Instagram
We maintain an online presence on the Instagram social network and process user data in this context. The service provider is Instagram Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA.
We use Instagram to provide information about the company and to communicate with users active on the network. Furthermore, data may be processed through the use of Instagram for market research and advertising purposes. This is carried out, for example, on the basis of tracking, where interest- or behavior-based profiling or cookies may be used, among other things. However, remarketing and reach measurement are also used, for which purpose access statistics - which recognize returning visitors - are created, for example.
In connection with the use of our online presence on Instagram, the following types of data may be processed: inventory data and contact data (e.g. name, address, email, telephone number), content data (e.g. entries in online forms, use of the message function), usage data (e.g. access to websites, clicks, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
Instagram is a product of Facebook and the text relating to Facebook applies accordingly.
12.3 Twitter Retargeting/Conversion Tracking
We use Twitter retargeting/conversion tracking “Twitter Ads” on our website. The service provider is Twitter Inc, 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. Within the European Union, the responsible body for handling data subject rights is Twitter International Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07 IRELAND (“Twitter”).
Twitter Ads enables us to collect data from users who visit our website. Cookies and code are used that connect our website to other third-party platforms such as Twitter. In the process, a non-reversible and non-personal checksum (hash value) is generated from your usage data and transmitted to Twitter for analysis and marketing purposes. In addition, a so-called “Twitter pixel” may be used to track the actions of users after they have viewed or clicked on a Twitter advertisement.
In this context, the following types of data may be processed: content data (e.g. entries in online forms, use of the messaging function), usage data (e.g. access to web pages, clicks, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses). In “cross-device personalization” Twitter also attempts to identify and link all of a user’s devices. Since the data is stored and processed by Twitter, a link to the respective user profile on twitter.com is also possible.
Although Twitter Ireland is the data controller, we would like to point out that it cannot be ruled out that the information collected by the cookies will be sent to a Facebook server in the United States of America (USA) and stored there. In the USA, there is no equivalent to the general adequacy decision of the European Commission certifying an adequate level of data protection. By transmitting your personal data, there is a risk that US authorities will access and process it for their own purposes.
The legal basis for this processing and the transfer of your personal data to the U.S. is your consent pursuant to art. 6 (1) (a) and art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR. You have the option to withdraw your consent at any time
here
.
Detailed information about data processing on Twitter, the option to object (opt out) and the possibility of enforcing data subject rights against Twitter can be found here:
https://twitter.com/en/privacy
. In Twitter’s privacy settings, you can personalize Twitter’s data processing and thus determine, for example, whether the service should tailor advertising to you and whether it may also include other apps installed on your mobile devices in the personalization. You can also set whether Twitter can analyze your location and use it for advertising purposes. Settings:
https://twitter.com/personalization
.
12.4 TikTok
We use a conversion tracking tool for advertisers, TikTok Pixel, on our website. The TikTok social media application is an international video portal. The service provider for the European region is TikTok Technology Limited, 10 Earlyfort Terrace Dublin, D02 T380, Ireland (“TikTok”).
By using the TikTok pixel (or comparable functions, for the transmission of event data or contact information via interfaces in apps), it is possible for TikTok to define the visitors to our online offering into a target group for the display of ads. We use the TikTok pixel to display ads that we place only to users on TikTok who have also shown an interest in their content (e.g. interest in certain movies and series) and transmit this information to TikTok. We also use the TikTok pixel to ensure that our ads match your potential interest and are not a nuisance. In addition, the TikTok pixel allows us to track the effectiveness of TikTok ads for statistical and market research purposes, because we can see whether users have been redirected after clicking on a TikTok ad (“conversion measurement”).
In this context, the following types of data may be processed: content data (e.g. entries in online forms, use of the messaging function), usage data (e.g., access to websites, clicks, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g., device information, IP addresses), and event data. Event data includes, for example, visits to websites, interactions with content, installations of apps, and purchases of movies. Event data is processed to create target groups for content and advertising information (Custom Audiences). Event data does not include specific content (such as comments written), login information, and contact information (e.g. names, email addresses, and phone numbers).
With regard to the data processing by the TikTok Pixel, JustWatch GmbH and TikTok are joint controllers according to art. 26 GDPR. You can view the joint processing agreement

.
Although TikTok Ireland is the data controller, we would like to point out that it cannot be ruled out that the information collected by the cookies will be sent to a TikTok server in the United States of America (USA) and stored there. In the USA, there is no equivalent to the general adequacy decision of the European Commission certifying an adequate level of data protection. By transmitting your personal data, there is a risk that US authorities will access and process it for their own purposes. The transfer of data to TikTok is subject to the
Standard Contractual Clauses of the European Commission
.
Please note that a linking of the data with other data (partly also on other devices) is possible. This risk exists in particular if you have a TikTok account and are logged in to TikTok. To avoid further data linking, we recommend that you log out of TikTok before visiting our company website.

12.5 YouTube
We integrate video content from the “YouTube” service of the provider Google and process user data in this context. The service provider is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, parent company: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
We use YouTube to show you video content, especially movie or series trailers.
The use of video content from YouTube in particular involves the processing of metadata and communication data (e.g. device information and IP addresses). However, usage data (e.g. access to websites, clicks, access times), contact data (e.g. email, telephone numbers), content data (e.g. entries in online forms) or inventory data (e.g. names, addresses) may also be processed.
We use YouTube in extended data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information about the users of our website before they have consented to the processing or watch the video. The disclosure of data by YouTube, on the other hand, is not necessarily excluded by the extended data protection mode. Thus, YouTube establishes a connection to the Google DoubleClick network, regardless of whether you watch a video.
A connection with YouTube’s servers is only established when you have consented to the use of YouTube on the embedded preview image of the service. Before that, no cookies are stored by YouTube on your device. Please note that a linking of the data with further data (partly also on other devices) is possible.
This risk exists in particular if you have a YouTube account and are logged in to YouTube. To avoid further data linking, we recommend that you log out of YouTube before visiting our company website.
The information collected by the cookies is usually sent to a Google server in the United States of America (USA) and stored there. In the USA, there is no equivalent to the general adequacy decision of the European Commission certifying an adequate level of data protection. By transmitting your personal data, there is a risk that US authorities will access and process it for their own purposes.
The legal basis for data processing in the context of embedding and displaying the preview images is art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
The legal basis for this processing and the transfer of your personal data to the U.S. is your consent pursuant to art. 6 (1) (a) and art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR. You have the option to withdraw your consent at any time

12.6 Pinterest
We operate a company page on “Pinterest”. The service provider is Pinterest Inc., 808 Brannan Street San Francisco, CA 94103-490, USA.
We would like to point out that you use the offered Pinterest service at your own risk and that we are not aware of all the details of data processing at Pinterest at this time. This applies in particular to the use of the interactive functions (e.g. sharing, commenting).
We process the data you enter on Pinterest, in particular your username and the content published under your account, insofar as we include it in our services and make it available to our followers.
If you visit our website and are logged into your Pinterest account at the same time, Pinterest can directly assign your visit to our website to your Pinterest account. If you do not want Pinterest to assign your data to your account, you must log out of Pinterest before visiting our website.
The legal basis for the data processing is art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
Data collected when using Pinterest is processed by Pinterest and thereby transferred to countries outside the European Union. In the USA, there is no equivalent to the general adequacy decision of the European Commission certifying an adequate level of data protection. By transmitting your personal data, there is a risk that US authorities will access and process it for their own purposes.

15. Data processing when cooperating with our customers and partners
We collect and process the personal data of our customers and partners for the initiation and implementation of the contractual relationship in question. The legal basis for the data processing is art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.
Furthermore, we have a legitimate interest in processing the personal data of our customers and partners for the purpose of direct mail advertising. The legal basis for the data processing is art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
The following categories of data are affected: Name, function, address, e-mail address and other business contact data. In principle, the personal data is collected directly, unless it is provided by another body, in particular by public authorities or - if third parties are named as a reference to us - by these third parties. The personal data will be stored for as long as is necessary for the processing of the order, including invoicing, and/or insofar as statutory retention obligations prevent the deletion of the data.
The personal data is processed by service providers that we use for order processing. In this context, it may happen that the data is transferred to countries outside the European Union. We would like to point out that there is no general adequacy decision of the European Commission for the USA, which certifies that the USA has an adequate level of data protection. By transferring the personal data, there is a risk that US authorities will access it and process it for their own purposes.
16. How we store and protect your data
We process and store your data in highly secure data centers within the EU, operated by Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud Platform. These data centers are secured and certified to the highest standards (at least ISO 27001, 27017, 27018 and EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)) and protected by signed data processing addenda.
All information provided is encrypted both during transmission (TLS) and at rest. Access to personalized information by employees is limited and audited.
The processing and storage of information that may be personally identifiable is kept to the minimum necessary for the operation of the service (e.g., your mobile GPS location is rounded to the nearest hundred meters before our systems are prompted to find movie theaters near you). Where necessary, this type of information is subject to access control, strict retention, and pseudonymization.
17. Your rights and options
17.1 Managing tracking technologies and deleting cookies
Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to withdraw your consent or to object to the processing of your data via cookies. You can initially declare your objection by means of your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (which may also restrict the functionality of our online services). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, e.g. via the websites
https://optout.aboutads.info
and
https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
.
Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent: we use a cookie consent management procedure from Usercentrics GmbH, Sendlinger Str. 7, 80331 Munich, Germany, in the context of which the consent of users to the use of cookies, or to the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure, can be obtained and managed and withdrawn by users. In this context, the declaration of consent is stored in order not to have to repeat its request and to be able to prove consent in accordance with legal obligations. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (a so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable technologies), in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device.
You can also control certain tracking tools on your mobile devices. For your convenience, here are instructions that may work for your mobile device; however, please note that the setting features may vary from device to device.
