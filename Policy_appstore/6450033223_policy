This notice, together with any other documents referred to on it, sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
Our address is:

Our website is
https://shift.ms/
and is owned and operated by Shift.ms.
This privacy notice applies to personal data provided to us, both by individuals themselves or by others. We only use personal data in the way described in this Privacy Notice.
The personal data that is provided to us is provided either directly from the individual concerned, from a third party acting on behalf of an individual, or from publicly available sources (such as internet searches, Companies House).
Where we receive personal data that relates to an individual from a third party, we request that this third party inform the individual of the necessary information regarding the use of their data. Where necessary, reference may be made to this privacy statement.
We process personal data for numerous purposes, and the means of collection, lawful basis of processing, use, disclosure, and retention periods for each purpose are set out in the relevant sections below.
This Privacy Notice also describes how we may share anonymised data from our users with our subsidiary Realworld ms Limited (‘Realworld’).  Realworld has been established by us to undertake survey research for stakeholders involved in MS research and treatments, including pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and research bodies.  All profits from these activities not required to fund Realworld are for the purpose of Shift.ms funding its charitable activities.  As described below, we may use your personal data to send you surveys that have been prepared by Realworld

The UK General Data Protection Regulation (‘UK GDPR') defines personal data as 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'), by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person'.
The Controller
A controller is the individual or legal person who controls and is responsible to keep and use personal data held in electronic files and certain paper files. Shift.ms is the  controller as defined by the UK GDPR for personal data gathered through its website or mobile apps (collectively referred to as the ‘websites’) and its social media accounts.
Lawful Processing
The lawful bases for processing personal data are set out in Article 6 of the UK GDPR. At least one of these must apply whenever personal data is to be processed.  Additional requirements may apply in respect of special category personal data, such as health data, and Shift.ms takes these requirements into account in respect of any health data you provide. :
(a) Consent: you have given Shift.ms your freely, specific, informed or unambiguous consent for your personal data to be processed for a specific purpose.
(b) Contract performance: the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract you have with Shift.ms.
(c) Compliance with legal obligation: the processing is necessary for Shift.ms to comply with the law for tax, social security, and employment purposes (not including contractual obligations).
(d) Protection of vital interests: the processing is vital to an individual's survival.
(e) Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for Shift.ms' legitimate interests, or the legitimate interests of a third-party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data that overrides those legitimate interests.

Generally, volunteers’ personal data will only be kept as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and for a maximum of 12 months after the individual stops volunteering for us, unless it was provided to us for another purpose (such as receiving services from us or for a research purpose).

If you would like to find out more about the way we store, use, and share anonymised data, including with Realworld, please write to us at dataprotection@shift.ms.
Sharing Your Personal Data
We will only share personal data with others when we are legally permitted to do so.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the organisation, or other individuals. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of safeguarding or other statutory regulations we have to comply.  We may also disclose your personal data to  organisations with whom you and we have reciprocal agreements for providing services for education, research and/or professional development.  These other organisations may become the controller of your personal data and we or they will provide appropriate privacy notices to you so you are aware how your data is processed.
As mentioned, we may use your personal data to send out materials that have been prepared by Realworld.  Subject to your having consented for us to share your personal data with Realworld (see immediately below), Realworld does not have access to our personal data and the information Realworld receives from us is fully anonymised.  Your participation in any Realworld activity is entirely voluntary.
We may request your permission to share your non-anonymised personal data directly with Realworld, and if so, we will set out details of the project underlying such request and the terms on which such sharing is governed, including what happens should you withdraw your request.  You may accept or reject this request at your sole discretion.

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
Protecting Your Personal Data
The data that we collect from you will be processed on our servers in the UK. If we do need to transfer your personal data out of the UK we will ensure that the required safeguards are in place so that there is an equivalent level of protection to it being processed in the UK.
Security of Your Information
To help protect the privacy of your personal data we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personal data to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees' privacy responsibilities.
How Long We Store Your Personal Data For
We store your personal data in accordance with our data retention policy. This policy is reviewed and updated internally to ensure we do not store your data for longer than is necessary. We also review how and where we store any data to ensure that we meet our obligation to store data securely.
In addition, some of the data we hold may be subject to certain legal and regulatory obligations, which provide a minimum retention period for different types of data. The retention period varies depending on the data we hold.
If you wish to find out more about our data retention practices, please contact us at dataprotection@shift.ms.
