4. Profiling
4.1 In connection with our marketing activities, we analyse some of the information that we collect about our customers (together with information about customers that we collect from our loyalty and other partners) to determine what offers are most likely to be of interest to different categories of customers in different circumstances and at different times. We call this the creation of “segments”. To do this, we combine Personal Data that we have collected from customers directly together with Personal Data that we have collected from our affiliates and other partners, including Asia Miles, about our customers’ purchase history and interactions with us. From time to time, we will assess the Personal Data that we hold about you in order to assign you to a particular segment. We will use the segment that you have been assigned to in order to tailor our marketing communications to include offers and content that are relevant to you.
4.2 You have the right to opt out of our direct marketing, and the underlying analysis of your Personal Data that we use to tailor the direct marketing that we send to you, at any time. You can exercise this right, by contacting us in accordance with section 8.4 of the Privacy Notice.
5. Our decision-making processes
5.1 In connection with our business, we will use your Personal Data to make various decisions about you and your eligibility to access our services, to prevent abusive use of our services, to ensure security of our systems, or to detect fraud. Some of these decisions may be taken on an automated basis including, by matching your Personal Data against information in certain risk models that we have created based on the behaviour of other individuals and using your Personal Data to further enhance such models.
6. Export outside the EEA
6.1 Your Personal Data may be accessed by staff or suppliers, transferred, and/or stored outside the EEA, including to countries which may have a lower level of data protection than  under EU DP law.

7. Retention period
Our retention periods for Personal Data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which it was collected and any other permitted linked purpose. For example, we may retain: (i) certain transaction details (e.g. flight history) and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction with us has expired (which is typically between 6 to 10 years after the relevant transaction occurred, and in some cases much less than this); or (ii) certain data to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. Where Personal Data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (in which case we may further retain and use the anonymised data) or securely destroy the data.

Marketing
6.1        We may use Personal Data for marketing and promotional purposes, including (i) for sending or showing you updates on latest news, offers and promotions in connection with our products and services (and the products and services of our group companies such as Asia Miles and third parties) (ii) for sending or showing you joint marketing offers about our travel services and packages, loyalty programmes, contests and sweepstakes, duty-free sales and ancillary services such as travel insurance, hotel transfers and car rentals; or (iii) for tailoring and tracking your interactions with internet banner advertisement and links from third party websites to our website.
6.2        We may also use Personal Data to analyse our customers’ preferences and market trends and derive insights, which we may use to tailor the types of products and offers that we present to you. This may involve us combining Personal Data that we hold about your use of our services with information that we have collected about your web usage. We may also combine information that we have collected about you with information that we have collected about our other customers in order to derive these insights and establish market trends. We may provide these insights to our third party partners and Asia Miles for their marketing and promotional purposes. We also use advertising services and products provided by third party service providers (such as marketing agencies and social media platforms) for marketing and promotional purposes, which may involve us sharing Personal Data that we hold about you with them.
6.3        We may communicate marketing, promotions and research invitations to you by post, telephone, or online (including by email or through your mobile device or via online banner advertisement) and, as appropriate and where required, we will ask you for your consent, or otherwise provide you with the opportunity to choose not to receive marketing, at the time we collect your data.
6.4        We will provide an option to unsubscribe or opt out of further communication on any direct marketing communication sent to you. You may also opt out by contacting us as set out in paragraph 8 below.
6.5        Please note that if you choose to unsubscribe or opt out of marketing communication, we will still send you communications about your travel with us and any other services that we provide to you. Where you are a Cathay Membership Programme member or a Registered Account holder, you will also continue to receive administrative emails, account summaries and updates to our services.

Transmission, storage and security of your Personal Data
7.1        IT Security
No data transmission over the Internet, a website, mobile application or via email or other message service can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of data protection legislation.
All Personal Data we collect about you is stored on our or our subcontractors’ secure servers. We comply with our security policies and standards when accessing or using this information and restrict access to your Personal Data to those persons who need to use it for the purpose(s) for which it was collected. You are responsible for keeping any information that we send to you confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. In particular, where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website or mobile applications, we ask you not to share a password with anyone.
7.2        Exporting your Personal Data
Your Personal Data may be transferred outside the country in which you are located, including to countries with a lower level of data protection than in the country in which you are located.
7.3        Retention period
Our retention periods for Personal Data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which it was collected and any other permitted linked purpose. For example, we may retain: (i) certain transaction details (e.g. flight history) and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction with us has expired (which is typically between 6 to 10 years after the relevant transaction occurred, and in some cases much less than this); or (ii) certain data to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. Where Personal Data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (in which case we may further retain and use the anonymised data) or securely destroy the data.
7.4        Methods and Process of Destruction of Personal data
We will destroy personal data without delay when either the purpose of processing has been achieved or the period of processing and retention has expired.
If it is required to continue to preserve personal data pursuant to other laws and regulations even though the retention period of the personal data consented by the data subject has expired or the purpose of processing such personal data has been achieved, the personal data shall be segregated to ensure that the purpose of processing will be limited accordingly.
The procedure and methods for destruction of personal data are as follows:
Destruction Procedure: We select the personal data subject to destruction and destroy them with the supervision of our Data Privacy Officer.
Destruction Methods: We permanently delete personal data stored in the form of an electronic file using a technical method that renders the record irrecoverable. For other records, printed materials, written documents or recording media, we destroy them by shredding or incinerating them.
