Part II – Information on the processing of personal data
What types of data do we collect, how do we collect it and for what purpose?
A.   Interested parties, online offers
1.  Obligation to provide the data:
The provision of the data is not required by law or contract. The data subject is not obliged to provide the data. However, in the event that the data is not provided, full use of our website is not possible.
2.   Purposes and legal basis:
The processing of users’ personal data is based on our overriding legitimate interest. For the provision of this website, it is technically necessary that we process certain personal data (e.g. the IP address, log files). For your communication, it is necessary that we handle your respective personal data.
Within the framework of the necessary balancing of interests, we have weighed up your interest in confidentiality and our interests in providing this website and contacting you. In each case, your interest in confidentiality takes a back seat. Otherwise, we would not be able to provide you with this website with a secure IT infrastructure or respond to your contact request.
The processing of personal data is also necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures that take place at the request of the user, such as customer service, as well as the processing of the contract including billing.
You can register for our newsletter on our website by giving the corresponding consent. For this purpose, we collect the personal data that you enter in the registration form. Your consent is the legal basis for our data processing. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.
Cookies are data records that are stored by a web server on the end device (e.g. computer, smartphone, tablet) of the user. These are sent back either to our website (“first party cookie”) or to another website to which the cookie belongs (“third party cookie”) when our website is called up again with the same end device.
The storage of information in your terminal equipment or the access to information already stored in your terminal equipment is absolutely necessary so that we can provide the telemedia service expressly requested by you as a user (Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG).
Otherwise, the legal basis is generally your consent in each case if no specific legal basis is stated below. You can revoke your consent at any time, e.g. by deleting cookies set via the browser settings of your end device. Please note that for technical reasons, this procedure only applies to the specific end device used.
3.   Recipient:
Due to our global business activities, your personal data will also be transferred to affiliated companies, among others. “Affiliated companies” are legally independent companies that are affiliated with us under company law (cf. §§ 15 ff AktG) and/or are part of the same group of companies. For the purposes of data transfer, this refers to viversum GmbH (Germany), Ingenio Europe GmbH (Germany), Barges Technologies, Inc (USA), Horoscope.com Inc. (USA), Peer Labs LLC (USA) and Ingenio, LLC (USA).
We use service providers in the provision of our services and our presence. Data is therefore transferred, for example, to IT service providers, archiving service providers, external lawyers, external tax consultants and external auditors. These service providers are contractually or legally obliged by us to exercise the same care in processing personal data as we do ourselves.
We may be required to disclose information to courts, authorities, the government or the police.
4.  Data transfer to third countries:
Data is transferred to third countries outside the European Union (e.g. to the USA and the UK). This generally takes place on the basis of contractual regulations provided for by law and, where applicable, supplementary technical-organisational guarantees which are intended to ensure adequate protection of your data and which you can view on request. In certain cases, we may also base such data transfer on consent.
Due to our global operations, your personal data will also be transferred to, among others, affiliates outside the EEA. In some cases, employees of certain service providers may also be located outside the EEA.
We have entered into a data transfer agreement with our affiliated companies that governs the cross-border transfer of your personal data within the group. This agreement is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission, which you can view here
–
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&locale=de
.
Where third parties transfer your personal data outside the EEA, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection, for example by entering into data transfer agreements or by ensuring that third parties are certified under appropriate data protection regimes.
5.      Storage period:
IP addresses are anonymised after 24 hours at the latest. Pseudonymous usage data is deleted after six months. If we do not provide you with explicit information on the storage period of permanent cookies, the storage period can be up to two years.
We do not keep your personal data longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the data is processed. However, please note that we must retain personal data if there is a legal obligation to retain it, e.g. in accordance with Section 257 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and Section 147 of the German Tax Code (AO).
We store your data,
-if you have consented to the processing, at most until you withdraw your consent,
-if we need the data to perform a contract, at most for as long as the contractual relationship with you exists or statutory retention periods run,
-if we use the data on the basis of a legitimate interest, at most for as long as your interest in deletion or pseudonymisation does not outweigh this.
B.   Advisor
1.   Obligation to provide the data:
The provision of the data is not required by law or contract. The data subject is not obliged to provide the data. However, in the event that the data is not provided, an advisory service is not possible.
2.   Purposes and legal basis:
The processing of personal data of advisors is carried out for the initiation, implementation and execution of the corresponding advisor contract. This enables the identification of the advisor, the establishment of contact and the implementation of pre-contractual measures. The processing also serves the purpose of corporate communication.
The processing of personal data of consultants is carried out for the fulfilment of legal obligations for proper accounting in coordination with external tax consultants and/or auditors, as well as commercial and tax law retention obligations.
The processing of personal data of consultants is also based on our overriding legitimate interest. It is necessary for us to handle your personal data for the documentation and possible evidence to courts or authorities.
Within the framework of the necessary balancing of interests, we have weighed up your interest in confidentiality and our interest in enabling effective documentation and evidence. In each case, your interest in confidentiality takes a back seat. Otherwise, we would not be able to comply with any justifications we may have to state institutions.
3.   Recipient:
Due to our global business activities, your personal data will also be transferred to affiliated companies, among others. “Affiliated companies” are legally independent companies that are affiliated with us under company law (cf. §§ 15 ff AktG) and/or are part of the same group of companies. For the purposes of data transfer, this refers to viversum GmbH (Germany), Ingenio Europe GmbH (Germany), Barges Technologies, Inc (USA), Horoscope.com Inc. (USA), Peer Labs LLC (USA) and Ingenio, LLC (USA).
We use service providers in the provision of our services. A transfer of data therefore occurs to shipping service providers, IT service providers, accounting service providers, archiving service providers, external lawyers; external tax consultants and external auditors. These service providers are contractually or legally obliged by us to exercise the same care in processing personal data as we ourselves do.
In certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose information to courts, authorities, the government or the police.
4.   Data transfer to third countries:
Due to our global business operations, your personal data will also be transferred to, among others, affiliated companies outside the EEA. Similarly, employees of certain service providers may be located outside the EEA.
We have concluded a data transfer agreement with our affiliated companies which regulates the cross-border transfer of your personal data within the group. This agreement is based on the EU Commission’s standard contractual clauses, which you can view and, if necessary, download here

5.   Storage period:
We do not keep your personal data longer than is necessary for the purpose for which this personal data is processed. However, please note that we must retain personal data if there is a legal obligation to retain it, e.g. in accordance with Section 257 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and Section 147 of the German Tax Code (AO).

-if we need the data to perform a contract, at most for as long as the contractual relationship with you exists or legal retention periods run,
-if we use the data on the basis of a legitimate interest, at most for as long as your interest in deletion or pseudonymisation does not outweigh this.
Applicant data for a position as a consultant will be automatically deleted after 6 months if no contract is concluded.
C.   Customers
1.   Obligation to provide the data:
The provision of the data is not required by law or contract. The data subject is not obliged to provide the data. However, if the data is not provided, it is not possible to use our service or create a customer account.
2.   Purposes and legal basis:
The processing of personal data is carried out for the initiation, implementation and execution of the corresponding contract. This enables the identification of the customer, the establishment of contact and the implementation of pre-contractual measures. The processing of personal data is also necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures that take place at the request of customers, such as customer service.

Part IV – Use of cookies
General
Our website uses cookies and other identifiers. Cookies are text files that are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser on the user’s computer system. When a user accesses a website, a cookie may be stored on the user’s operating system. This cookie contains a characteristic string of characters that enables the browser to be uniquely identified when the website is called up again. We use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. Some elements of our website require that the calling browser can be identified even after a page change. When our website is called up again with the same terminal device, these are sent back either to our website (“first party cookie”) or to another website to which the cookie belongs (“third party cookie”). Some providers we use also process your personal data outside the EU/EEA.
We use Usercentrics as a cookie management tool. You will find an overview of cookies and identifiers in this tool.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the use of technically necessary cookies/identifiers is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR). The storage of information in your terminal equipment or the access to information already stored in your terminal equipment is absolutely necessary so that we can provide the telemedia service expressly requested by you as a user (Section 25 (2) no. 2 TTDSG).
In addition, the legal basis is generally your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR, § 25 para. 1 TTDSG). You can revoke your consent at any time, e.g. by deleting cookies set via the browser settings of your end device. Please note that for technical reasons, this procedure only applies to the specific end device used. This may restrict the functionality of our online offer.

5.      Use of Facebook Custom Audiences and Facebook Visitor Action Pixel
Furthermore, we use so-called retargeting technologies. This technology makes it possible to address internet users who have already shown interest in our offer, as well as internet users to whom this probably also applies, with advertising on the websites of our partners (e.g. Facebook). The display of these advertisements on our partners’ sites is based on cookie technology and an analysis of previous user behaviour. This form of advertising is pseudonymous. The use of retargeting technology is carried out in compliance with the applicable legal data protection regulations.
Specifically, we use Custom Audiences from Facebook on this website. For this purpose, so-called Facebook pixels are integrated on our websites, which mark you as a visitor to our website in pseudonymised form. If you are later logged into Facebook, a non-reversible and thus non-personal checksum (profile) from your usage data is transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. We also provide Facebook with hashed, i.e. pseudonymised, email addresses of our users.
With your consent, we use the “visitor action pixel” of Facebook Inc. within our website. With its help, we can track the actions of users after they have seen or clicked on an advertisement. This enables us to record the effectiveness of the advertisements on the aforementioned platforms for market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous for us, which means that we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by the respective platform provider, about which we inform you according to our state of knowledge.
Types of data processed
: Usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), location data (data indicating the location of an end user’s device), event data (Facebook) (“event data” is data that may be transmitted, e.g. via Facebook Pixel (via apps or other means), from us to Facebook and relates to individuals or their actions; the data includes e.g.. Event data is processed for the purpose of creating target groups for content and advertising information (custom audiences); event data does not include login data or interaction data, e.g. comments under an embedded post; event data also does not include contact information (i.e. data that (clearly) identifies data subjects, such as names, email addresses and telephone numbers).
Data subjects
: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
Purposes of processing
: Tracking (e.g. interest/behavioural profiling, use of cookies), remarketing, visit action evaluation, interest-based and behavioural marketing, profiling (creation of user profiles), targeting (determination of target groups relevant for marketing purposes or other output of content), cross-device tracking (cross-device processing of user data for marketing purposes).
Security measures
: IP masking (pseudonymisation of the IP address).
Legal basis

11.   Newsletter distribution through Emarsys (email marketing)
Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG is an Austrian company based in Berlin that provides the software and infrastructure for sending consent-based electronic messages. Emarsys is aware of its responsibility towards the recipients of such messages and has a zero-tolerance spam policy.
Analysis and performance measurement:
The newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a dispatch service provider, from their server.
The information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behaviour based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times. This analysis also includes determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients, but it is neither our intention nor, if used, that of the dispatch service provider to observe individual users. Rather, we use the analyses to identify the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.
A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible; in this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled or must be contradicted.
Prerequisite for the use of free services: Consent to send mailings may be made conditional as a prerequisite to avail of free services. If users wish to take advantage of the free service without subscribing to the newsletter, please contact us.

Opt-out/unsubscribe

12.   Mailchimp (email marketing)
We use the list provider MailChimp to send our newsletter.
The data stored during registration is transmitted to Rocket and stored by Rocket. The data entered during registration will not be transmitted to other third parties. After registration, MailChimp will send you an email to confirm your registration. Furthermore, MailChimp offers various analysis options on how the newsletters sent are opened and used, e.g. to how many users an email was sent, whether emails were rejected and whether users unsubscribed from the list after receiving an email. However, these analyses are only group-related and are not used by us for individual evaluation. MailChimp also uses the Google Analytics analysis tool from Google, Inc and may integrate it into the newsletters. Further details on Google Analytics can be found in this privacy policy under “Google Analytics”.

14.   Youtube
We use the provider YouTube, among others, for the integration of videos.  When you call up the Internet pages of our website that are provided with a plugin – for example, our media library – a connection is established to the YouTube servers and the plugin is displayed.

Part V – California, USA (CCPA)
This section applies only to you if you are a resident of the State of California in the U.S. and applies only to personal information for which we have a “business” (as defined in the CCPA) and not to personal information we collect from you as part of our services to you if you are an employee, owner, director, officer or contractor of a business, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit organisation or government agency. It applies to personal information we collect from California residents on or through our Services and in other ways (e.g., offline or in-person data collection).
Overview of the personal data we collect about you
For individuals residing in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires disclosure of the categories of personal information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from which we obtain personal information, and the third parties to whom we disclose that information. We are keen to keep the information simple for our users. The categories are set out below as required by the CCPA. Please see our Privacy Policy for examples and more information about how we collect and use information.
Depending on how you interact with us, we may collect the following categories of data as set out in the table below.
Any personal data we collect about you (as set out below) comes from the source categories below:
From you, including through your use of our Services
Automatically recorded by you
Our Group companies
Third parties (for example, if you give permission to social networks to share your data with us or if you have made that data publicly available online).
Categories of personal data we collect
Categories of third parties with whom we share this data
Identifiers (such as name, address or email address)
– Third parties (such as our service providers)
– Aggregators (such as analytics services)
Activities on the internet or other networks or devices (such as browsing history)
– Third parties (such as our service providers)
– Aggregators (such as analytics services)
Location data (for example, obtained by inferring your IP address)
– Third parties (such as our service providers)
– Aggregators (such as analytics services)
Classifications protected by law (such as gender and marital status)
Third parties (such as our service providers)
Other data that identifies you or can be linked to you in a meaningful way
– Third parties (such as our service providers)
– Aggregators (such as analytics services)
Categories of business purposes for our use of your data
All categories of personal data we collect about you (as detailed in the above) will be used for the following purposes:
Error detection, error reporting and activities to maintain the quality or safety of our services.
Auditing consumer interactions on our website
Other uses of which we will inform you
Rights and choices in California
Subject to certain limitations, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request the following from us:
Disclosure of the personal data we collect about you, deletion of all our data collected about you or stored by you. In addition, you may object to the sale of your personal information. As a California resident user, you also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.
This section describes how you exercise these rights and how we deal with requests made to us, in particular to verify your identity. If you would like more information about your rights under applicable law, or if you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
privacy@adviqo.com
.
Accessing and deleting your personal data
right to request access to your personal data
As a California resident user, you have the right to request that we disclose the categories of your personal information that we collect, use or sell. You also have the right to request certain partial disclosures of the personal information we collect about you. However, we are entitled to withhold information the disclosure of which poses too great a risk to you or your personal data (for example, in the case of financial data or passwords).
right to request the deletion of your personal data
You have the right to request that we delete all personal data that we have collected about you/from you.
However, we may withhold certain personal data under applicable law, including personal data necessary to fulfil the following purposes: Providing our Services; Protecting our business and system from fraudulent activity; Identifying and correcting errors that affect existing functionality; Exercising freedom of expression or other rights as necessary for us or others; Complying with law enforcement requests under a lawful process; For scientific or historical research; For our own internal purposes that are reasonably related to your relationship with us; or To comply with legal requirements. We need certain types of data to enable us to provide our services to you. If you want us to delete it, you may no longer have access to our services.
Users residing in California may exercise their privacy rights granted by the State of California by sending their request by email to
privacy@adviqo.com
.
Identification
Also, for security reasons, we may request supplemental information from you that is necessary to verify your identity when you apply to exercise your privacy rights in California.
If we have reason to believe that the security of your account has been compromised, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information requested, we will request further information from you to check against the records we hold to verify your identity.
If you would like to exercise any of the rights listed here and you do not have an account with us, please contact us by email at
privacy@adviqo.com
. We will then request further data to carry out the identity check, if possible.
Sale of personal data
The CCPA requires companies that “sell” personal information (as that term is defined in the CCPA) to give California residents the right to opt-out of such sales. adviqo does not “sell” your personal information as we understand and interpret the term.
Non-discrimination rights
Users residing in California have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising their rights as described in this section. We do not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
Part VI – Brazil (LGPD)
For users who are residents of Brazil, the following additional provisions apply:
Legal provisions regarding data processing equivalent to the GDPR can be found in Art. 7 LGPD.
Additional rights
In addition to the rights already set out, you have the right to request confirmation of the existence of the processing. Access to your data will be given, according to your choice, either in a simplified and printed form or in an electronic form, or by a clear and complete statement indicating the origin of the data, the non-existence of the data set, the criteria used and the purpose of the processing, subject to commercial and industrial confidentiality and within fifteen days from the date of your request. To request confirmation or access to your data, please submit a request to the following email address:
privacy@adviqo.com
, or use the contact details provided above and indicate the form in which you wish to receive the information requested.
You also have the right to request the anonymisation of data that is not necessary or excessive, or data that has been processed in breach of the provisions of the LGPD, unless we are required by law to retain your personal data (see Art. 16 LGPD). To do so, please submit a request to the following email address:
privacy@adviqo.com
In the case of fully automated processing of personal data, you have the right to request a review by a natural person if the automated decision negatively affects your interests. We will therefore provide clear and sufficient criteria and procedures used for the automated decision, subject to commercial and industrial confidentiality.
Data security
We use technical and administrative measures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access and accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, communication or disclosure, and to prevent the occurrence of damage resulting from the processing of personal data. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable. Nevertheless, if a security incident occurs, we will inform you in accordance with applicable law.
Part VII – SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY STATEMENT
adviqo GmbH maintains various online presences within social networks to which the following data protection declaration applies. This privacy policy summarises and describes all social media used by adviqo GmbH.
Please note that your data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for you because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce your rights.
For a detailed presentation of the respective forms of processing and the options to object (opt-out), we refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.
If you assert data subject rights against us regarding processing in a social network, we will refer you directly to the social network, as we ultimately do not have the technical possibilities and technical authorisations to comply with your request.

Jointly responsible for the operation of the respective online presence within the meaning of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the respective operator of the network (see identity in the respective section of the social network) and the

Personal data that you provide to us as part of an enquiry or message will only be processed by us for the purpose of handling your enquiry/message. adviqo will delete messages from completed processes from the inbox after one year at the latest. Whether and for how long the social networks make backups of these messages is not known to us and can only be answered by the social networks themselves.

We have entered into a special agreement with Facebook (“Page Insights Information”, https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum), which in particular regulates which security measures Facebook must observe and in which Facebook has agreed to fulfil the data subject rights (i.e. you can, for example, send information or deletion requests directly to Facebook). The rights of users (in particular to information, deletion, objection and complaint to the competent supervisory authority) are not restricted by the agreements with Facebook.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content

Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
