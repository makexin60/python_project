By entering into this Agreement or using the Services, you agree to receive communications from us, including e-mails, text messages, alerts, and other electronic communications. Standard message and data rates apply to all messages sent to or received from us. Any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that the communication be in writing.
15. Dispute Resolution
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time such informal dispute resolution is pursued, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. Except as expressly set forth herein, any dispute, claim, or controversy (each, a “Claim”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Consumer Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the AAA, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any Claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The procedures and rules of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of any arbitration. The AAA Rules are available at
www.adr.org/arb_med
or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
You and Reframe each acknowledge and agree to waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and Reframe each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, or other intellectual property right. If any court or arbitrator determines that the foregoing class action waiver is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision herein shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
In addition to the severability provisions set forth above, in the event that any portion of this arbitration provision is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of this section shall be given full force and effect. Any Claim or cause of action you may have arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise, such cause of action or claim is permanently barred. The parties specifically exclude from application to this Agreement the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.
16. Term and Termination
This Agreement commences when you first visit or use any feature of the Services and shall continue throughout your subscription period. Your subscription will automatically renew for successive periods of the same length unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days before such renewal. We may, without prior notice and at our sole discretion: (i) change the Services, stop providing the Services or features of the Services to you or to users generally, or create usage limits for the Services; and (ii) suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services in the event we have reason to believe you are in violation of this Agreement or have otherwise caused harm to us or another user. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation of the Services or your access thereto, your right to access or use the Services will immediately terminate. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive the termination of your access to the Service , including without limitation, provisions regarding ownership, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
17.  General
Except as provided in above, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Fulton County, Georgia for the purpose of litigating any dispute. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights herein, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign this Agreement at any time without notice or consent. If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid, you agree that such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Agreement. No waiver by Reframe of any breach or default of this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. This Agreement represents the complete agreement between Reframe and you regarding the subject matter set forth herein and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between Reframe and you.
