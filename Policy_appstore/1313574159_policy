11. Use of facial recognition by FR Stores
This section sets out how a FR Store will collect, use and protect personal information collected using that store’s FR System.
How will I know it’s a FR Store?
Each FR Store will have signage to notify you that it uses facial recognition technology in its store. If you do not want your personal information to be collected by the FR System,
please do not enter a FR Store
.
What type of personal information will a FR Store collect using its FR System?
A FR Store will collect facial images of everyone entering that store. The store’s FR System will convert these facial images into a digital code called a ‘biometric template’ and will compare that biometric template with those of individuals who that store has previously identified as a person of interest (as defined below). If your facial image does not match with the image of a person of interest, your image and associated biometric template will be automatically deleted from the FR System immediately.
The FR Store may also collect and save your image from its CCTV system into its FR System if the store reasonably believes that you are a person of interest.
A person of interest is someone who has:
(a) stolen or damaged store property, or been aggressive, violent or threatening towards staff or customers, or re-entered the store after being trespassed (an “offender”); or
(b) actively assisted an offender in the commission of the harmful behaviour described in (a) (an “accomplice”).
If you are a person of interest, stores may also collect the following personal information:
•your name;
•a description of the incident; and
•a trespass notice reference ID.
How long will personal information be kept in a FR Store’s FR System?
Where the FR System does not find a match between the collected facial image and a person of interest, then the collected facial image (and associate template) is immediately and automatically deleted.
Where the FR System finds a match and that match is verified by specially trained staff as a person of interest, it will store images of offenders for up to 2 years (unless they re-offend), and images of accomplices for 3 months.
Will personal information collected by a FR Store’s FR System be disclosed to anyone else?
Personal information collected by a FR Store’s FR System will only be disclosed to:
•specially trained store personnel with a legitimate need-to-know;
•Foodstuffs and its service providers for the purpose of assisting the FR Store with operating its FR System; and
•law enforcement where compelled to do so by law.
Please note that FR Stores cannot access or extract biometric templates from their FR Systems.
Can I request removal of my image from the FR system?
In certain circumstances, a FR Store can remove an individual that is a person of interest from its FR System. All other images are automatically deleted from the FR System if there is no match.
If you wish to query your enrolment in the FR System as a person of interest, or if you have any other questions, please email
privacy@foodstuffs.co.nz
.
If you wish to request the removal of your information/image from the FR system, please set out in your email: (i) the store the incident took place in, (ii) the date and time of the incident, (iii) what happened, and (iv) the reasons why your information/image should be removed from the FR system. The store will then consider your request by reviewing the information you have provided, including assessing it against the information it has relating to the incident.
How do I access and update my personal information held in a FR Store’s FR System?
You may submit a request to access and correct any personal information held about you by a FR Store directly to that store or by emailing
privacy@foodstuffs.co.nz
.
12. Will this policy change?
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and we will tell you about a change in the Privacy Policy by updating the “last updated” date on our website.
Unless otherwise stated, any changes to the Privacy Policy will take effect immediately upon being placed on the website and your continued use of the Services will represent an agreement by you to be bound the Privacy Policy as amended.
