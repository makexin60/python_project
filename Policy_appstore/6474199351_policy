The
b
sport
e-mails can contain a small invisible image of 1 pixel, which can be used to inform the sender (
b
sport
) of the opening of the e-mail. If the recipient of the e-mail has images enabled on their device, upon opening the e-mail, a message (an automatic request) is sent, to the
b
sport
server, asking for the image. This request is logged by
b
sport
and tells us that the email has been opened.Â A similar process can be used for links or attachments in the email, with a request sent to
b
sport
for content that is accessible via the links or attachments, thus indicating to
b
sport
that the link or attachment has been viewed.
This system is managed by our partner
Sendgrid
