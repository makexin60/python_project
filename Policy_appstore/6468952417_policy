Introduction
Welcome to
90s Yearbook AI Headshot
developed by Hbrothers L.L.C. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your data is protected. This policy details the data collection, usage, and protection practices for our app.
Data Collection
For the core functionality of the app, we require 12 selfies. We collect and process these images to deliver our service as described below.
Use of Collected Face Data
The 12 selfies are used to develop a deep learning model, deploying the "dreambooth" technique, to curate characters featuring the user’s face. This model is created and deployed once for each user to facilitate the app’s features.
Data Sharing and Storage
We collaborate with "replicate.com" to generate models and predictions. Any output created by replicate.com is deleted after one hour, and all user data are stored privately. The results showcased to users are securely stored on our servers.
Data Retention and Deletion
User data is stored as long as the account remains active. Upon account termination, all data, including selfies, are deleted from our servers. Please note that while we aim to remove data immediately, residual backups might contain information for a brief period due to technical and legal constraints.
User Rights
Users reserve the right to access, modify, or erase their data. Additionally, users have the right to port data, object to data processing, and withdraw consent to process, while retaining the legality of prior processing based on consent. Any user wishing to exercise these rights may contact us directly.
Security
We prioritize data security and implement robust security measures to protect user data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. While we strive to safeguard your data, please note that no electronic transmission is 100% secure.
Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to modify our privacy policy. Updates will be reflected on this page, and while we aim to communicate major changes directly, we encourage users to periodically review our policy for any updates.
