It describes the personal information that we collect, the purposes for which we use such information, and your choices regarding our use of it. The steps we take to protect your personal information and how you can review and correct your personal information are also covered here. By accessing our websites, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.
Communications
With your permission, we may use your personal information gathered via our websites to inform you of products or services available from Barcom. When collecting information that might be used to contact you about our products and services, we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications. Moreover, each e-mail communication we send includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication. If you elect to unsubscribe, we will remove you from the relevant list within 10 business days.
Disclosure of your personal information
Except as described below, personal information you provide to Barcom through our websites will not be shared outside of Barcom and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.
Use of Cookies
The Barcom website uses cookies to enhance your online experience. A cookie is a small text file placed on your hard drive by a web server. Cookies cannot run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie.
Cookies primarily serve to save you time by notifying the web server of your return to a specific page. For instance, if you visit Barcom pages or register on Barcom’s site, a cookie helps Barcom remember your information on future visits. This makes it easier to record your personal details, such as billing and shipping addresses. When you revisit the Barcom website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, allowing you to use the customized features of Barcom more efficiently.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline them if you prefer. However, declining cookies may limit your ability to fully experience the interactive features of Barcom’s services or websites.
Security
Barcom is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in facilities to which access is limited. For sites to which you login, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others. When you move around a site to which you have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism, we verify your identity by means of an encrypted cookie placed on your machine.
Reviewing your personal information
In some cases, you can review and correct personal information provided through our websites by going to the page on which you provided the information. In all cases, you can make a request to review and correct your personal information collected via our websites or ask Barcp, to stop using it by completing our Contact Us form. We may take steps to verify your identity before providing you access to your personal information. You can help us to maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any change to your mailing address, phone number, or e-mail address.
Links to other sites
Our websites may contain links to other sites such as Barcom sales affiliates, professional and government organizations, and publications. We also link to third-party providers that host, maintain and operate on-line training curricula. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.
Enforcement of this privacy statement
If you have questions regarding this statement or our handling of your personal information, please Contact Us. We will promptly address your concern and strive to reach a satisfactory resolution.
Changes to this privacy statement
Barcom may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top and bottom of the privacy statement. We will obtain your opt-in consent for any updates to this privacy statement that materially expand the sharing or use of your personal information in ways not disclosed in this privacy statement at the time of collection.
