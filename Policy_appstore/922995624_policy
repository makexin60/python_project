The specific nature of the communications may vary depending on Your role as well as what specific services or requests you have made. These communications include:
Marketing communications

You can opt out of or unsubscribe from any marketing communications by following the instructions in those messages, by changing your communications preferences within your account or through your device. You can also opt out by contacting
help@getsling.com
. Opting out of one communication will not necessarily opt you out of all marketing communications.

7. How long does Sling keep your personal information?
Sling retains personal information as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services, carry out the purposes described in this Statement, or as otherwise required in order to comply with our records retention periods (which reflect the applicable law). For example, we may retain information about users of our Services in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or to protect our interests as part of providing the Services.
In the majority of cases, Sling processes the personal information of Application Users as a processor on behalf of the Account Holder. As a result, Sling’s retention of the Account Holder’s employment-related information will be governed by the terms of the agreement between Sling and the Account Holder. Such information may also be managed independently by the Account Holder as part of its own obligations as part of managing its business. Sling maintains a retention schedule for the removal of this information following the termination of any such agreement with the Account Holder.
8. Securing your information
Sling will take appropriate steps to protect any personal information that we collect and store from unauthorized access, misuse, loss, and destruction by employing administrative, technical, and physical security measures. However, even though we have taken such measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that the collection, transmission and storage of personal information will always be completely secure.
9. Your rights with regard to your personal information
Overview
Depending on your location, you may have specific individual rights under the applicable law in relation to how we process your personal information. These individual rights may include a right of deletion, access, correction, portability as well as rights in relation to various processing restrictions (e.g., sale, sharing and targeted advertising). Additional information on these rights and how to invoke them can be found below, as well as in our location-specific addendums linked in this Statement.
Applicability
If you are an Application User and would like to make a request relating to our use of your personal information in the context of the Services we provide to your company or organization and for which we are a data processor, please contact your company or organization initially.

How to invoke your rights

Where applicable, these requests can be submitted by an authorized agent through the channels described above in accordance with the applicable law.  In these instances, we will take steps to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.

We also use pixels and related technologies as part of session replay services on certain Websites that are used to understand and improve functionality and an individual’s experience on those sites.
Targeted advertising and your choices
In certain cases, we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our Websites, mobile applications and within our Services to collect information about you and your activities for interest-based advertising or other targeted content.  The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.

Categories of personal information sold or shared
While Sling does not “sell” personal information in the traditional sense, we do, however, sell or share personal information for the purpose of displaying advertisements that are selected based on personal information obtained or inferred over time from an individual’s activities across businesses or distinctly-branded websites, applications or other services (otherwise known as “targeted advertising” or “cross-context behavioral advertising”), for personalization features and for tracking and analytics purposes.
The categories of personal information impacted in the preceding 12 months may include:
Identifiers;
Internet/Network Information; and
Inferences.
Each of the above categories of information may be disclosed to third-parties, which may include our business partners depending on the nature of a user’s interactions.
Consumers can exercise their right to opt out of these sales or sharing through our cookie management tool that can be accessed by clicking on our “
Do not sell or share my personal information
” link at the bottom of
https://getsling.com
. You can also opt out of the “sale” of personal information or “sharing” for targeted advertising purposes by enabling the Global Privacy Control or a similar opt-out preference setting within the browser you use to access our Websites. Please note that your opt out will be specific to the device and browser you use when you opt out, and our Websites will recognize opt-out preference settings only on domains of our Websites where any “selling” or “sharing” occurs. You may also review our Privacy Statement section titled “Cookies and other tracking technologies” for more information on how Sling uses cookies, analytics and personalized advertising. Sling has no actual knowledge that the “sales” or “sharing” described above include the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
C.
Description of rights available to Consumers
If you are a resident of the state of California and subject to certain legal limitations and exceptions, you may be able to exercise some or all of the following rights:
The right to know/access: you have the right to request that an in-scope business that collects personal information from you, disclose the following in relation to the preceding 12 month period, upon verification of your identity: (i) the categories of personal information collected about you, (ii) the categories of sources where the personal information was collected, (iii) the business or commercial purposes for collecting (or where applicable, selling or sharing) the personal information, (iv) the categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose along with the corresponding recipients, (v) the categories of personal information we have sold or shared along with the corresponding recipients, and (vi) the specific pieces of personal information collected about you.
The right of deletion: you have the right to request that an in-scope business delete personal information that it has collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
The right of correction: you have the right to request that an in-scope business correct inaccurate personal information, subject to certain conditions.
The right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information: you have the right to request that an in-scope business refrain from selling or sharing personal information it has collected about you to third parties now or in the future. If you are under the age of 16, you have the right to opt in, or to have a parent or guardian opt in on your behalf, to such sales or sharing.
The right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information: to the extent that we use sensitive personal information for purposes beyond those set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 1798.121, you have the right to limit the use or disclosure of that sensitive personal information subject to the exceptions within the CCPA.
The right of access to and to the ability to opt-out of automated decision-making technology: subject to further regulations being issued, you have the right to access information pertaining to automated decision-making technologies and the ability to opt out.
The right against discrimination and retaliation: you have the right to not be discriminated or retaliated against as a result of exercising any of the above rights.
However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you with our Services or engage with you in the same manner. In addition, the exercise of the rights described above may result in a different price, rate, or quality level of product or service where that difference is reasonably related to the impact the right has on our relationship or is otherwise permitted by law.
Please note that your ability to invoke the rights above are limited pursuant to the scope and limitations of the CCPA, including any available exceptions. For example, an access request can only be made twice by a Consumer within a 12-month period.
D.

Once an individual rights request has been submitted, Sling may ask you for additional information in order to verify your identity or to provide additional details to help us respond to your request. This may include your name, email address, phone number or other details related to your use of Sling’s Services. Where applicable, these requests can be submitted by an authorized agent through the channels described above in accordance with the applicable law.  In these instances, we will take steps to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may refuse to act or impose limitations on your rights, as permitted by the applicable law in relation to individual rights submissions.

To Exercise the Right to Opt Out of the Selling or Sharing of Personal Information
Unless you have exercised your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information, we may “sell” or “share” your personal data to third parties for targeted or cross-context behavioral advertising purposes, for personalization features and for tracking and analytics purposes. The third parties to whom we sell or share personal information may use such information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy statements. In these instances, the right to opt out of the sale of personal information can be invoked through our cookie management tool that can be accessed by clicking on our “Do not sell or share my personal information” link at the bottom of
https://getsling.com
. You can also opt out of the “sale” of personal information or “sharing” for targeted advertising purposes by enabling the
Global Privacy Control
or a similar opt-out preference setting within the browser you use to access our Websites. Please note that your opt out will be specific to the device and browser you use when you opt out, and our Websites will recognize opt-out preference settings only on domains of our Websites where any “selling” or “sharing” occurs.  Although Sling does not currently engage in other practices at this time that may constitute a “sale” or “sharing” beyond these instances and the methods above are the most effective methods to manage your preferences, you may also submit your right to opt out of any sales or sharing by
clicking here
or in instances where you would like additional support. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your right to opt out of personal information sales or sharing. However, if applicable, we may ask you to provide additional personal information so that we can properly identify you in our dataset and to track compliance with your opt out request. We will only use personal information provided in an opt out request to review and comply with the request. If you choose not to provide this information, we may only be able to process your request to the extent we are able to identify you in our systems. Once you make an opt-out request, you may change your mind and opt back in to future personal information sales at any time by contacting us at
privacy@getsling.com
or by managing your preferences within the cookie management tool.

Sensitive Personal Information
As part of our services, Sling collects “sensitive personal information” as defined by the CCPA as part of our operations and the Services offered to our Account Holders. The categories of sensitive personal information are described below along with the use case and whether the information is sold or shared.
Category of sensitive personal information
Use/Purpose
Is the sensitive personal information sold?
Is the sensitive personal information shared?
Account log-in details plus password or credentials
Account Holders – needed to access the Sling account
Application Users – needed to access the Sling services
No
No
Precise geolocation
Account Holders (in their capacity as an Application User) – needed for clocking in and out of shifts and only collected where you have enabled location services on your device.
Application Users – needed for clocking in and out of shifts and only collected where you have enabled location services on your device.
No
No
Presently, Sling does not use or disclose an individual’s sensitive personal information for purposes other than those specified in subdivision (a) of section 1798.121 of the CCPA and as a result, has not included a Notice of Right to Limit.
H.  Retention
We retain personal information as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services and carry out the purposes described in this Statement. However, if necessary, we may retain personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, or for instances where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority.
To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations.
The retention period will vary depending on our relationship. For example,
For Account Holders, we will generally retain their personal information for the duration of our agreement with the Account Holder plus a period following termination as provided for in our retention schedules.
For Application Users, Sling will generally maintain Application User accounts that are required to access an Application Holder’s account page for the duration of the individual’s use of Services plus a period of inactivity.  Application Users are also permitted to remove these user accounts on an ad hoc basis when relevant (e.g., the individual is no longer part of an Account Holder’s organization).
In all cases, the retention will be subject to any additional legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other applicable obligations.
Once retention of the personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal information and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.
I.
Notice of Financial Incentives
Neither Sling nor the Services contemplate any program or service involving financial incentives or requiring notification of a financial incentive. This Statement does not take into account any obligations imposed on the independent businesses of our Account Holders based on their operations.
J.   Deidentified information
We may at times receive, or process personal information to create, deidentified information that can no longer reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual or household. Where we maintain deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the information except as required or permitted by law.
K.  Updates to this Statement
We will update this Statement from time to time. When we make changes to this Statement, we will change the “Last updated” date at the beginning of this Statement. All changes shall be effective from the date of publication unless otherwise provided in the notification.
2. California “Shine the Light” disclosure

You may also have the right to access information about the ways in which your personal information is or has been used and the names of individuals and/or organizations to which your information has been disclosed.

If we cannot provide you with access to your personal information or are unable to correct your personal information, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions, and outline further steps available to you. If we refuse to act on a request to correct your personal information, we will nonetheless annotate the information, noting the correction that was requested but not made.
In certain cases, depending on the nature of your request, there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which, due to applicable law or as part of Services that are in the process of being carried out, will not be removed or changed. We will also retain information relating to your request for recordkeeping and compliance purposes.
D. International transfers
We may process, store, and transfer your personal information in and to a foreign country, with different privacy laws that may or may not be as comprehensive as Canadian law. In these circumstances, the governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country may be able to obtain access to your personal information through the laws of the foreign country.
Specifically, the personal information collected as part of the Services or as otherwise contemplated by this Statement is primarily processed and stored in the United States. However, as Sling is an international organization with business processes, offices and third parties around the world, your information may be sent to any other country in the world where we do business or maintain third-party relationships. When you provide personal information to us through the Services and as part of this Statement and addendum, you consent to the transfer of your information and the processing of your information in this manner. Any international transfers made will be in accordance with the Statement, this addendum and the applicable law.
We also impose appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information among our affiliates and to third-party service providers in various jurisdictions, and have implemented appropriate contractual arrangements or other measures for such purposes.
To obtain a current list of the countries where personal information subject to this Statement is collected, used, disclosed and/or stored, including with our service providers, as well as the purposes for which our service providers outside Canada have been authorized to collect, use or disclose personal information for or on behalf of Sling, please contact

Last updated: May 1, 2024
The provisions below supplement the information provided in the generally applicable portion of our Statement and are relevant where the data protection laws of the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) apply. To the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of this Addendum G and the provisions of the main body of the Statement, the provisions of this Addendum G shall prevail.

Sling ehf. (“Sling Iceland”)
Gudrunartuni 8
105 Reykjavik

Toast, Inc. (“Toast US”)

Toast US is also responsible for managing any requests you make to exercise your rights under the GDPR or other applicable data protection legislation, on behalf of both Sling Iceland and Toast US.
Toast US is primarily responsible for managing aspects of the processing that are within its control as part of the joint controller relationship. This includes support and management pertaining to the provision of the Services, obtaining consents from data subjects (where applicable) as well as support with providing notice to data subjects.  Where Sling Iceland receives a data subject request under the GDPR, Sling Iceland will promptly notify Toast US of the request.
Where we are a Controller, we are free to rely on “data processors” (as defined within the GDPR) and have engaged various third-party service providers in order to provide the Services as well as for other purposes described in the main body of the Privacy Statement. For more information, see the “How Sling discloses your personal information” section of the Privacy Statement.
Sling Iceland and Toast US also act as processors on behalf of our Account Holders in connection with certain aspects of our Services.  The Account Holder is the data controller in respect of this relationship.

We collect and process your personal information based on the following legal bases:
Purpose of processing (as described further in section 4 of this Statement)

To communicate with you or provide information you have requested
Where we have a contract with you, necessary for the performance of our contract with you

Where we process personal information on the basis of a legitimate interest (as identified above), as required by data protection law, we have carried out a balancing test to document our interests, to consider what the impact of the processing will be on individuals and to determine whether individuals’ interests outweigh our interests in the processing taking place. You can obtain more information about this balancing test by using the contact details at the end of this Addendum.
Where we collect personal information to administer our contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations, this is mandatory and we will not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you or otherwise provide the Services without this information. In all other cases, provision of the requested personal information is optional, but this may affect your ability to use our Services or our websites.
C. International transfers
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement to countries that have not been found to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission.
In particular, we may transfer your personal information to third parties, including to parties located in the United States. We use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information to third party service providers.  Where required, we have implemented the EU/EEA approved standard contractual clauses, rely on a service provider’s processor binding corporate rules or have implemented/rely on other legally recognized safeguards for data transfer purposes.
We also use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information among our affiliates in the United States. We have implemented the EU/EEA approved standard contractual clauses or have implemented/rely on other legally recognized safeguards for data transfer purposes.

D. Choice and access
You have additional rights regarding how your personal information is processed, including the right to:
request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information;
request the transfer of your personal information you have provided to us to you or another company in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
request rectification of your personal information when it is inaccurate or incomplete;
request erasure of your personal information where permitted under the applicable law, such as where the information is no longer necessary or lawful for us to store or where your information is outdated;
restrict or object to the processing of your personal information (as applicable), including to object to the processing of personal information for direct marketing purposes; and
withdraw your consent at any time where this is the legal basis on which we are processing your personal information. If you ask to withdraw your consent, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place at that time.
Please note that if you choose to withdraw your consent, you may not be able to participate in or benefit from the programs, services and initiatives for which you provided consent to the processing of your personal information. Your rights will in each case be subject to the restrictions set out in applicable data protection laws.
You may exercise these rights free of charge by submitting your request here or to
privacy@getsling.com
. Where Sling is the data processor and the Account Holder is the data controller in respect of your personal information, you may be required to submit your request directly with the Account Holder in accordance with applicable law or alternatively Sling may require approval from the Account Holder as controller prior to proceeding with your request, in accordance with applicable law. Subject to the applicable law, Sling may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character. In some situations, Sling may refuse to act or impose limitations on the information disclosed if, for instance, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of your personal information with a Supervisory Authority in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement as defined in Section I below.
E. Retention
We will retain your personal information for only as long as needed for the purpose of the processing activity or where we have a legitimate business need to retain it, subject to our legal and regulatory obligations to retain it longer and our applicable records retention periods. The duration of these periods will vary depending on your relationship with Sling and the Service you are using. For example,
Account Holders:
Account Holder account and ownership information will generally be maintained for seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship absent a legal or regulatory obligation to retain longer;
Application Users:
Application User is maintained pursuant to the retention schedule of the Application Holder or alternatively, seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship absent a legal or regulatory obligation to retain longer.  Application Users may request that their Sling accounts used to access the platform and the Services be removed on an ad hoc basis.
Other periods are set out within Sling’s records retention policy and schedule. Our retention periods are also subject to any rights of individuals or other requirements that might dictate a shorter retention period (e.g., deletion requests). In certain cases, Sling may also maintain information for a longer period of time, such as in cases where the information is subject to a legal claim or complaint. Following those periods and other determinations on the duration of the processing of personal information by Sling, we will delete or take measures to anonymize your personal information.

You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the

GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
