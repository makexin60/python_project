Privacy Policy !
Studio NX
is the commercial name used by
Digital Distribution Doumengine S.A.S
(the "Service Provider"), based in 47 rue de Bahinos,
Anglet 64600 , France,
to develop and distribute free-to-play, ad-supported mobile games (the "Services") on platforms such as the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Our vision is to offer you a modern day arcade game experience but rather than inserting coins in the machine, you will encounter ads every few levels.
If you want, you also have the option to make in-game purchases, including the "No ads".
We're committed to transparency about the data we collect and the reasons behind it.
It is also very important for us that players have a healthy relationship with our games, that they don't feel tricked or like it's a waste of time playing them.
That's why if you have any questions, suggestions, concerns or need more clarity on our company, we will really appreciate if you could reach out to us at
