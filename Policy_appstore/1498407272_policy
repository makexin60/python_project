Privacy Policy
OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU
Your privacy is a top priority for us as we create and construct the services and products you know and love. We value your trust in us, and we do not take that trust lightly.
We do not compromise your privacy. All of our services and products are designed with your privacy in mind. We engage professionals in a variety of sectors, such as legal, security, engineering, and product design, to guarantee that no decision or action is made or done without regard for your own privacy.
We aim to strive for transparency in the way we process your data. We know that inadequate information and convoluted wording are widespread flaws in privacy rules because we use other online services that you also use. Our Privacy Policy and associated materials are written in straightforward English so you don't have to deal with legalese or jargon. We are open and honest, and we want you to read our rules and learn about our privacy practices.
We work hard to keep your information secure. We are committed to ensuring the safety and security of your information. To keep your details safe, we regularly update our security protocols and invest in our security efforts.
We appreciate your trust in our Services with your personal information, and we plan to preserve it. This begins by ensuring that you fully understand the information we gather, why we collect it, how we use it, and your privacy options. This Privacy Policy explains our privacy practices in plain English, avoiding legal and technical jargon as much as possible.
This Privacy Policy applies starting October 1, 2023.
EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 2023.

WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES
This Privacy Policy applies to all of Boo's websites, applications, events, and services. In this Privacy Policy, we may refer to all of these as "Services" for clarity. We've placed web links to this Privacy Policy and on all related services to make it even clearer.
Some services may have their own privacy policies. If a specific service has its own privacy policy, that latter policy takes precedence over our Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Without some details about you, like basic profile and the sorts of individuals you'd like to meet, we won't be able to assist you in making significant connections. We may also collect information created by your use of our services, in the form of access logs, as well as details from third parties, like when you use a social media account to access our services. We go into further depth below about the information that we may collect.
Information you give us
You may choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:
When you create an account on our Service, you provide us your login credentials as well as some basic information about yourself that is required for the service to function, such as your gender and date of birth.
When you have finished your profile, you may add more information about yourself, like your personality, choice of lifestyle, interests, and other personal information, as well as multimedia like images and videos. You may need to provide us access to your camera or photo album to contribute particular content, such as images or videos.
Some of the information you choose to tell us, such as your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, and religious views, may be deemed "special" or "sensitive" in certain countries. You consent to our processing of this information if you choose to supply it.
When you supply us or our payment service provider with information like your debit or credit card number or other financial information in the event that you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than just through a mobile platform such as iOS or Android).
When you engage in surveys or focus groups, you provide us with information on our goods and services, as well as replies to our questions and testimonials.
We collect the details you use to register or enter when you choose to participate in our promotions, events, or competitions.
We gather the information you provide us throughout the conversation whenever you contact our customer service staff. We occasionally monitor or record these exchanges for training reasons and to guarantee excellent service quality.
If in the event you ask us to communicate with or to handle the information of others (for example, in the event that you may ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we may collect the information about others that you provide us to fulfill your request.
Of course, as part of the service's operation, we also handle your discussions with other users and the information you upload.
Information we receive from others
In addition to the information you supply us directly, we obtain information about you from third parties, such as:
Social networking sites.
You may be able to create and log into your Boo account using your social network login (for example, Facebook Login). This allows you to share information your from your social network account with us without having to input your login name and password.
Other People.
As other users use our services, they may give details about you. For example, if other users contact us about you, we may gather information about you from them.
Other collaborators.
Other partners may get information about you from our partners, such as when Boo advertisements are published on a partner and platforms and websites (in which case they may send along campaign success details).
Information collected when you use our services
We gather information on which features you've used, how you've used them, and the devices you use to access our services when you use our services. More information may be found below:
Usage Information
We may collect the information about your activity on our services, like as how you use them (like the date and time you logged in, the features you've been using, the searches, clicks, and the pages shown to you, the referring web page address, the advertising resource that you clicked on) and how you have interacted with other users ( or the users you connect and interact with, the time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).
Device information
We gather data from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, such as:
sensor data from devices like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and compasses;
hardware and software information: These information are your IP address, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (like Google's AAID and Apple's IDFA, which are both randomly generated values that you can reset through your device' settings), device ID and type, the browser type you are using, version and language, operating system of your device, time zones, other virtual identifiers used by cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (like IMEI/UDID and MAC address);
details of your wireless and mobile network connection, your service provider and signal strength;
information on device sensors like as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.
We use Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at
https://stripe.com/privacy
.
Other information with your consent
If you give us permission, we can gather your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) via a variety of methods, depending on the service and device you're using, such as GPS, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi connections. If the authorization you granted us in your device settings specifically enables such collection, we may gather your geolocation in the background even when you aren't using the services. We will not gather your geolocation if you refuse to give us permission to do so. Similarly, with your permission, we may gather images and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video, or conduct streaming on the services).
Cookies and other similar data collection technologies
We implement cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device, and we may enable third parties to use them as well. You may read our Cookie Policy for other information on why we use them (for example, to verify you, remember your preferences and settings, analyze site traffic and trends, deliver and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and allow you to use social features) and how you can better control their use using your browser settings and other tools.
Some web browsers, like Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, contain a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") function that informs websites that a user does not want his or her online behavior recorded. If a website that reacts to a DNT signal gets a DNT signal, the browser can prevent the website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. DNT signals are not yet standard, and not all browsers support them. As a result, many companies, including Boo, do not yet respond to DNT signals.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION
The primary reason we utilize your information is to improve our services and provide the best possible personal experience. Furthermore, we use your personal information to keep you secure and to show you advertisements that may be of interest to you.

For example, when you use our service to develop meaningful connections, we utilize your information to keep your personal account and profile up to date, make it visible to other users, and recommend other users to you.
Legitimate interests:
We may use your information if we have a good reason to. For example, we evaluate user activity on our services to constantly improve them, we recommend offers we believe you might be interested in, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection, and other legal purposes.
Consent:
We may ask for your permission to use your information for certain purposes from time to time. You have the right to withdraw your personal permissions at any time by contacting us on the email address shown at latter part of this Privacy Policy.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
Because our purpose is to assist you in making meaningful relationships, the majority of information shared by users is, of course, with other users.
We also share some users' information with some service providers and partners that help us operate the services, as well as with other Boo related organizations and, in some situations, government authorities.
Continue reading to learn more about how your information is shared with others.
With other users.
When you freely provide information on the site, you share it with other users (including your public profile). Please exercise caution when filling up your profile with too much information. Ensure that the content you submit is information that you are happy to have publicly visible, we, neither you, can control what the others users do with your information once you share it. If you want to adjust the filters so that your profile is only available to certain users, your information will be visible according to your preferences.
With our service providers and partners.
We may rely on third-party vendors to assist us in our everyday operations and improve user experiences. These third parties help us with different tasks, such as analytics, data hosting and maintenance, payment processing, customer service, marketing, advertising, and security operations. We may also share information with the partners who distribute and assist us with advertising displayed within our services. For example, we may likely share limited information about you in hashed, non-human readable form with advertising associates. We follow a strict vetting protocol before engaging any service provider or working with any partner to make sure our operations are secure and safe, including the security of your information. All of our service providers and partners must sign confidentiality agreements. We also work with third-party vendors that provide artificial intelligence services to enhance user experiences, such as generating conversation icebreakers or images. These vendors may process user data solely for the purpose we contract them for, and are not allowed to use the data for any other reason. This might involve processing user data such as demographic information, location, and messages to generate AI-assisted responses or icebreakers. The data used in this way is processed in real-time and not stored by our AI partners. Your raw data is never used for any other purpose without your explicit consent.
For corporate transactions.
We may transfer your information if ever we are engaged in a merger, acquisition, sale, reorganization, restructuring, dissolution, in the event of bankruptcy, or other change of ownership or control, in whole or in part.
When required by law.
We may disclose your information to the necessary parties if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
To enforce legal rights.
We may also share information: I to reduce our liability in a pending or threatened lawsuit; (ii) to protect our legal rights and the legal rights of other users, business partners, or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements and contracts with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other suspicion or wrongdoing.
With your consent or at your request.
We may request your permission to share your information with related third parties. In such cases, we will explain why we want to disclose the information. Under any of the aforementioned circumstances, we may use and share non-personal information (information that, by itself, does not identify you, like device information, the general demographics, collective behavioral data, geolocation in a de-identified form), and personal information in hashed, non-human readable form. We may also share this information with other Boo-affiliated organizations and third parties (particularly advertisers) in order to design and deliver targeted advertising on our services and third-party websites or applications, as well as to evaluate and report on advertising you see. These details may be combined with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form obtained from other sources. More details on the use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.
Cross-border data transfers
Section 6 information sharing may necessitate cross-border data transfers (for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions).
YOUR RIGHTS
Boo wants you to be in control of your personal information, so we have provided you with the following tools:
Access / Update tools in the service.
Tools and account settings that enable you to view, correct, or remove information supplied to us and linked with your account directly inside the service. If you have any queries about those tools or settings, please get in touch with our customer service staff at
hello@boo.world
for assistance.
Device permissions.
Your mobile device has permission settings that enable for location sharing and alerts, like phone book and location services, as well as push notifications. You can alter your device's settings to agree or disagree with collecting the associated information or displaying the corresponding alerts. And of course, if you do this, some services, like our location filter, may no longer operate correctly.
Deletion.
You can remove your account by utilizing the service's associated capability for account deletion.
We want you have an awareness of your privacy rights so here are a few key points to remember:
Reviewing your information.
You may have the right to inspect the personal information we maintain about you under applicable privacy laws (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You may request a copy or file of your personal information by contacting
hello@boo.world
.
Updating your information.
If you feel that the information we have on file for you is wrong or you revoke our right to use your details and you wish to seek rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, you may contact us via
hello@boo.world
.
For your own protection and the protection of all of our users, we may require you to provide adequate proof of identity before accommodating the above requests.
Please remember that we may reject requests for a few reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or endanger the privacy of another user. Suppose you may wish to receive details relating to another user, like a copy of messages or images you received from them through our service. In that case, the other user will need to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before any information is released.
Also, we can't accommodate specific requests to object to the processing of personal details, notably where such requests would not allow us to give our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service without your date of birth.
Uninstall.
You can stop all information collection of an application by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you have uninstalled the app from your device, the unique identifier associated with your device may most likely be continuously stored. If you then re-install the application on the same mobile device, we may be able to re-associate this unique identifier to your previous dealings and activities.
Accountability.
In some countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to file a complaint with relevant data protection authority if in case you have certain concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can complain with notably may be that of your current residence, where you work or where we are currently established.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
If you are currently a resident of California, you may request a notice containing the categories of personal identifiers about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this, you may submit your request at
hello@boo.world
. Please allow 30 days for a response. For your security and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide your proof of identity before answering such a request.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
Boo works hard to protect you from unauthorized access or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. But as with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.
We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to update our physical, technical, and organizational security measures.
We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at
hello@boo.world
.
HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
We may keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business use (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law. To ensure the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we may implement a safety retention window of three (3) months following account deletion. During this time, Boo will retain account information, although the account may not be visible on the services anymore.
In practice, we may delete or keep your information anonymously upon deletion of your account (thus abiding by the safety retention window) or specifically, after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:
We may keep it to comply with applicable law (for example, some "traffic information" is kept for one year to be able to comply with statutory data retention obligations);
We must keep it as evidence of our compliance with applicable law (like, records of consent to our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other similar legal documents are kept for five years);
The presence of an unresolved issue, claim or dispute needing resolution and thus requiring us to keep the relevant information to aid the process and;
The details must be kept for our legitimate business interests, like fraud prevention and improving users' safety and security. For example, personal information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for violating behavior or security issues from opening a new account.
Keep in mind that even though our process is designed to carry out data deletion protocols according to the above guidelines, we cannot guarantee that Boo will delete all data within a specific time frame due to technical restrictions.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our services are restricted to 18 years of age or older. We don't allow users under 18 on our platform, and we do not knowingly collect personal details from anyone under 18. If you are suspecting that a user is under the age allowed, please make use of the reporting feature available through our service.
PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
This privacy policy may change over time because we're always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful personal connections. We will notify just before we implement changes to have time to review the changes.

For example, when you use our service to develop meaningful connections, we utilize your information to keep your personal account and profile up to date, make it visible to other users, and recommend other users to you.
Legitimate interests:
We may use your information if we have a good reason to. For example, we evaluate user activity on our services to constantly improve them, we recommend offers we believe you might be interested in, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection, and other legal purposes.
Consent:
We may ask for your permission to use your information for certain purposes from time to time. You have the right to withdraw your personal permissions at any time by contacting us on the email address shown at latter part of this Privacy Policy.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
Because our purpose is to assist you in making meaningful relationships, the majority of information shared by users is, of course, with other users.
We also share some users' information with some service providers and partners that help us operate the services, as well as with other Boo related organizations and, in some situations, government authorities.
Continue reading to learn more about how your information is shared with others.
With other users.
When you freely provide information on the site, you share it with other users (including your public profile). Please exercise caution when filling up your profile with too much information. Ensure that the content you submit is information that you are happy to have publicly visible, we, neither you, can control what the others users do with your information once you share it. If you want to adjust the filters so that your profile is only available to certain users, your information will be visible according to your preferences.
With our service providers and partners.
We may rely on third-party vendors to assist us in our everyday operations and improve user experiences. These third parties help us with different tasks, such as analytics, data hosting and maintenance, payment processing, customer service, marketing, advertising, and security operations. We may also share information with the partners who distribute and assist us with advertising displayed within our services. For example, we may likely share limited information about you in hashed, non-human readable form with advertising associates. We follow a strict vetting protocol before engaging any service provider or working with any partner to make sure our operations are secure and safe, including the security of your information. All of our service providers and partners must sign confidentiality agreements. We also work with third-party vendors that provide artificial intelligence services to enhance user experiences, such as generating conversation icebreakers or images. These vendors may process user data solely for the purpose we contract them for, and are not allowed to use the data for any other reason. This might involve processing user data such as demographic information, location, and messages to generate AI-assisted responses or icebreakers. The data used in this way is processed in real-time and not stored by our AI partners. Your raw data is never used for any other purpose without your explicit consent.
For corporate transactions.
We may transfer your information if ever we are engaged in a merger, acquisition, sale, reorganization, restructuring, dissolution, in the event of bankruptcy, or other change of ownership or control, in whole or in part.
When required by law.
We may disclose your information to the necessary parties if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
To enforce legal rights.
We may also share information: I to reduce our liability in a pending or threatened lawsuit; (ii) to protect our legal rights and the legal rights of other users, business partners, or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements and contracts with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other suspicion or wrongdoing.
With your consent or at your request.
We may request your permission to share your information with related third parties. In such cases, we will explain why we want to disclose the information. Under any of the aforementioned circumstances, we may use and share non-personal information (information that, by itself, does not identify you, like device information, the general demographics, collective behavioral data, geolocation in a de-identified form), and personal information in hashed, non-human readable form. We may also share this information with other Boo-affiliated organizations and third parties (particularly advertisers) in order to design and deliver targeted advertising on our services and third-party websites or applications, as well as to evaluate and report on advertising you see. These details may be combined with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form obtained from other sources. More details on the use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.
Cross-border data transfers
Section 6 information sharing may necessitate cross-border data transfers (for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions).
YOUR RIGHTS
Boo wants you to be in control of your personal information, so we have provided you with the following tools:
Access / Update tools in the service.
Tools and account settings that enable you to view, correct, or remove information supplied to us and linked with your account directly inside the service. If you have any queries about those tools or settings, please get in touch with our customer service staff at
hello@boo.world
for assistance.
Device permissions.
Your mobile device has permission settings that enable for location sharing and alerts, like phone book and location services, as well as push notifications. You can alter your device's settings to agree or disagree with collecting the associated information or displaying the corresponding alerts. And of course, if you do this, some services, like our location filter, may no longer operate correctly.
Deletion.
You can remove your account by utilizing the service's associated capability for account deletion.
We want you have an awareness of your privacy rights so here are a few key points to remember:
Reviewing your information.
You may have the right to inspect the personal information we maintain about you under applicable privacy laws (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You may request a copy or file of your personal information by contacting
hello@boo.world
.
Updating your information.
If you feel that the information we have on file for you is wrong or you revoke our right to use your details and you wish to seek rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, you may contact us via
hello@boo.world
.
For your own protection and the protection of all of our users, we may require you to provide adequate proof of identity before accommodating the above requests.
Please remember that we may reject requests for a few reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or endanger the privacy of another user. Suppose you may wish to receive details relating to another user, like a copy of messages or images you received from them through our service. In that case, the other user will need to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before any information is released.
Also, we can't accommodate specific requests to object to the processing of personal details, notably where such requests would not allow us to give our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service without your date of birth.
Uninstall.
You can stop all information collection of an application by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you have uninstalled the app from your device, the unique identifier associated with your device may most likely be continuously stored. If you then re-install the application on the same mobile device, we may be able to re-associate this unique identifier to your previous dealings and activities.
Accountability.
In some countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to file a complaint with relevant data protection authority if in case you have certain concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can complain with notably may be that of your current residence, where you work or where we are currently established.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
If you are currently a resident of California, you may request a notice containing the categories of personal identifiers about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this, you may submit your request at
hello@boo.world
. Please allow 30 days for a response. For your security and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide your proof of identity before answering such a request.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
Boo works hard to protect you from unauthorized access or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. But as with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.
We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to update our physical, technical, and organizational security measures.
We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at
hello@boo.world
.
HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
We may keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business use (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law. To ensure the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we may implement a safety retention window of three (3) months following account deletion. During this time, Boo will retain account information, although the account may not be visible on the services anymore.
In practice, we may delete or keep your information anonymously upon deletion of your account (thus abiding by the safety retention window) or specifically, after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:
We may keep it to comply with applicable law (for example, some "traffic information" is kept for one year to be able to comply with statutory data retention obligations);
We must keep it as evidence of our compliance with applicable law (like, records of consent to our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other similar legal documents are kept for five years);
The presence of an unresolved issue, claim or dispute needing resolution and thus requiring us to keep the relevant information to aid the process and;
The details must be kept for our legitimate business interests, like fraud prevention and improving users' safety and security. For example, personal information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for violating behavior or security issues from opening a new account.
Keep in mind that even though our process is designed to carry out data deletion protocols according to the above guidelines, we cannot guarantee that Boo will delete all data within a specific time frame due to technical restrictions.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our services are restricted to 18 years of age or older. We don't allow users under 18 on our platform, and we do not knowingly collect personal details from anyone under 18. If you are suspecting that a user is under the age allowed, please make use of the reporting feature available through our service.
PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
This privacy policy may change over time because we're always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful personal connections. We will notify just before we implement changes to have time to review the changes.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the
legal bases

Transaction Data

Learn More
. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transaction with the Business User.

. A Business User who uses Stripe’s Terminal Service to provide its goods or services to End Customers may use the Terminal Service to collect End Customer Personal Data (like your name, email, phone number, address, signature, or age) in accordance with its own privacy policy.
Identity/Verification Information
. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them. Where allowed, we also use End Customers' Personal Data for Stripe’s own purposes such as enhancing security, improving and offering our Business Services, and preventing fraud, loss, and other damages, as described further below.
Payment processing and accounting

We use your Transaction Data to deliver Payment-related Business Services to Business Users — including online payment transactions processing, sales tax calculation, and invoice, bill, and dispute handling — and to help them determine their revenue, settle their bills, and execute accounting tasks.
Learn More
. We may also use your Personal Data to provide and improve our Business Services.
During payment transactions, your Personal Data is shared with various entities in connection with your transaction.
