11. Specific information about automated decision-making and profiling
“
Automated-decision making”
is the process of making a decision by fully automated means without human involvement. In some cases these decisions
could have a legal or similarly significant
effect on you as an individual. “
Profiling
” means analysis of an individual's personality, behaviour, interest and habits to make predictions or decisions about them. Where authorised under EU or Member State law or where necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract, we may in some cases use automated decision-making or profiling for decisions. An example of our use of automated decision making is evaluation of your creditworthiness to assess your suitability for certain credit products.
We believe that by making such decisions automatically, PayPal increases its objectivity and transparency in deciding which services to offer you. We deploy several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. You can always ask for a manual decision-making process instead, express your opinion or contest decision making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, if such a decision would produce
legal effects or otherwise similarly significantly affect you
. You can find out more about how to object to these decisions in Section 10
(“Your data protection rights”)
.

if you require more information on our use of Automated-decision making or Profiling.
12. Why do we share your Personal Data with credit reference agencies?

We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity.
The legal bases for such transmissions are found in Article 6, paragraph 1, letter b (contractual) and Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f (legitimate interest) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”).
We will also continue to exchange information about you with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time.

16. Banking Regulations Notice for Users in the EEA and UK
In general, the Luxembourg laws to which PayPal’s handling of user data is subject (data protection and bank secrecy) require a higher degree of transparency than most other EU laws. This is why, unlike the vast majority of providers of internet-based services or financial services in the EU, PayPal has listed in this Privacy Statement the third party service providers and business partners to whom we may disclose your data, together with the purpose of disclosure and type of information disclosed. You will find a link to those third parties
here
. By accepting this Privacy Statement and maintaining an account with PayPal, you expressly agree to the transfer of your data to those third parties for the purposes listed.
PayPal may update the list of third parties referred to above on the first business day of every quarter (January, April, July and October). PayPal will only start transferring any data to any of the new entities or for the new purposes or data types indicated in each update after 30 days from the date when that list is made public through this Privacy Statement. You should review the list each quarter on the PayPal website on the dates stated above. If you do not object to the new data disclosure, within 30 days after the publication of the updated list of third parties, you are deemed to have accepted the changes to the list and to this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with the changes, you may close your account and stop using our services.
In order to provide the PayPal Services, certain of the information we collect (as set out in this Privacy Statement) may be required to be transferred to other PayPal related companies or other entities, including those referred to in this section in their capacity as payment providers, payment processors or account holders (or similar capacities). You acknowledge that according to their local legislation, such entities may be subject to laws, regulations, inquiries, investigations, or orders which may require the disclosure of information to the relevant authorities of the relevant country. Your use of the PayPal Services constitutes your consent to our transfer of such information to provide you the PayPal Services.
Specifically, you agree to and direct PayPal to do any and all of the following with your information:
a. Disclose necessary information to: the police and other law enforcement agencies; security forces; competent governmental, intergovernmental or supranational bodies; competent agencies, departments, regulatory authorities, self-regulatory authorities or organisations (including, without limitation, the Agencies referenced in the “Agencies” section of the Third Party Provider List

Any other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your Personal Data, subject to the terms of this Policy.

2. General Statement of Privacy and Protection of Personal Information
Trolley understands that privacy is important to both our online visitors and Registered Users. We respect your privacy and will take reasonable steps to protect your information.
3. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Policy covers the treatment of personally-identifiable information, i.e. any information that identifies or relates to an individual, or can be used in conjunction with other information to identify an individual (“Personal Information”). This Policy also covers Trolley treatment of any Personal Information that Trolley may share with its business partners or other third parties under very limited circumstances.
This Policy does not apply to the general practices and treatment of information (whether personal or not) by third parties that Trolley does not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites or services that you elect to access through the Website or via a link from the Website (“Third Party Website”), or to individuals that Trolley does not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access or link only to those Third Party Websites that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Websites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Website you access.
4. No Collection of Personal Information as a Matter of Course
Your Personal Information is only processed (a) with your freely given, informed consent, (b) if the processing is necessary to fulfil a contractual or legal obligation towards you, (c) upon your request to perform an action that requires processing or (d) if we are obliged to do so under applicable laws. We will only process Personal Information for the stated purpose or use and to the extent necessary, as described in the next section of this Policy.
5. Personal Information Collected and its Uses
The following describes the Personal Information collected from you when you use the Website and what we use it for. When you submit Personal Information about third parties, you represent and warrant that you have their permission and consent to submit that Personal Information to us and for Trolley to use their Personal Information as described in this Policy. When you submit Personal Information about the Legal Entity you represent, you represent and warrant that you have the capacity and authority to do so.
“Account Information”. In order to use the Services, you will be required to create an account by entering the following Personal Information: a valid email address, your full name, your company name, your company website, and your phone number. You may also choose to add additional Authorized Users to your account by submitting first and last names and email addresses of additional individuals; this shall also be considered Account Information. This Account Information is used to manage your account, to verify your credentials for logging-in to the Website, to facilitate your use of the Services, and to communicate with you information about your account.
“Onboarding Information”. In order to become a Merchant and make payments you will be required to submit Personal Information to determine whether you are qualified to use the Services, as more fully described in the Terms of Use. This complete list of Onboarding Information will be made available to you during the onboarding process, but it includes information about you, your Legal Entity, other individuals at your Legal Entity, and certain banking or financial information. In addition, you will be required to upload government-issued identification and other documentation, which shall also be deemed Onboarding Information. We may also request additional Onboarding Information following your initial submission of your Onboarding Information. This Onboarding Information is used to determine your qualifications to become a Merchant and use the Services, to facilitate the execution of your Merchant Agreement with a Financial Services Provider, and to facilitate payments made to Recipients.
“Recipient Information”. In order to make payments to Recipients, you must submit the following Recipient Information: (i) for an individual, first and last name, and a valid email address; or (ii) for a company, business name and a valid email address. We use this Recipient Information to verify the Recipient’s ability to receive a payment, and to facilitate payments to the Recipients through the Services.
“Third Party Account Information”. In order to make payments to Recipients, you must submit the following Recipient Information: (i) for an individual, first and last name, and a valid email address; or (ii) for a company, business name and a valid email address. We use this Recipient Information to verify the Recipient’s ability to receive a payment, and to facilitate payments to the Recipients through the Services.
In addition to the uses described above, we may also use Personal Information you have submitted:
To facilitate and improve customer service;
To send you periodic emails of interest. Please see the Email Communications section further in this Policy for more information.
There may be other instances where we collect and process Personal Information which cannot be sufficiently covered in this Policy. If this is the case, we will notify you at the point of collection of the Personal Information and, if required, will ask for your consent and notify you of the nature and scope of the processing.
We may process your Personal Information for as long as we have a contractual or business relationship with you or, if longer, for the duration required by applicable laws. Note that applicable laws may require us to process your data regardless of your consent and/or for a period considerably longer than the business relationship between us.
6. Security and Encryption of Information
Trolley uses industry best practices (physical, electronic and procedural) in keeping any data collected (including Personal Information) secure. In addition, Trolley uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Website, and these third parties have been selected for their high standards of security, both electronic and physical. For example, Trolley uses Amazon AWS, a recognized leader in secure data, for hosting of the Website and storage of data, including Personal Information. Please note that these third parties may not be located in your home jurisdiction – see the “Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your Home Jurisdiction” section further in this Policy for more information.
7. Non-disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties
Except as provided in the next paragraph and the sections in this Policy on Use of the Services and Mailing List Management, Trolley does not divulge any Personal Information to third parties. Moreover, Trolley does not sell, rent, trade or license any Personal Information to third parties. Only the employees, agents, subcontractors, officers, directors, or assigns of Trolley (or of Trolley’s affiliates) are responsible for the management and development of the Trolley service, and only these individuals have access to the information collected. These employees, agents, subcontractors, officers, directors or assigns all have been instructed to comply with the Policy.
We may share any Personal Information:
(1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims or demands, or anything substantially similar to the foregoing where we have a legal obligation to comply;
(2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or any violation of the Terms of Use or any other agreement between you and us or in order to comply with applicable laws;
(3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Website infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website infrastructure or the Website generally);
(4) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Trolley (in which case we will require such entities to honour this Policy);
(5) if Trolley merges with another entity, is subject to a corporate reorganisation, or sells or transfers all or part of our business, assets, or shares (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Policy, or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy).
8. Use of Personal Information when making Payments
When you use the Services to make payments to Recipients, your Personal Information and that of the Recipient is transferred to Financial Services Providers and Third Party Payment Providers involved in the execution of the payment. Such Personal Information is only used for the making of the payment and to monitor compliance with applicable laws and the rules of the payment scheme in question;
Note that the use of our Services is usually covered by the Terms of Use or a Merchant Agreement and these may contain further information relating to our processing of data generally, including the processing of Personal Information. In case of any conflict between the Terms of Use or the Merchant Agreement and this Policy, the former take precedence.
9. Email Communications and Compliance with Anti-Spam Laws
Trolley uses
SendGrid
for sending out transactional emails to you, and uses
Drift
and
Marketing Cloud (formerly Pardot)
to manage our mailing list and send out marketing emails (collectively “Third Party Email Suppliers”). Personal Information is transferred to these Third Party Email Suppliers in order for our email communications to function properly. Your Personal Information is only used for the proper sending out of email; we have agreements in place that ensure that the Third Party Email Suppliers do not use this Personal Information for any other purpose, and will not transfer or sell your Personal Information to any other third party.
We will only send you marketing emails (i.e. emails that are not strictly necessary for the provision of Services to you) if you have allowed us to do so. You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from us at any time by following the link at the bottom of any email sent to you.
Trolley’s practices with regards to their email communications are designed to be compliant with anti-spam laws, specifically the law unofficially called “CASL”, or Canada’s Anti-Spam Law or, if you reside in the European Union, with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. If you believe you have received email in violation of these laws, please contact us using the contact information further up in this Policy.
10. Limited Gathering of Information for Statistical, Analytical and Security Purposes.
Trolley automatically collects certain information using third-party analytics programs from
Google Analytics
and
Marketing Cloud Account Engagement
to help us understand how our users use the Website, but none of this information identifies you personally. For example, each time you visit the Website, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and computer type, access times, the web page from which you came, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable). We use information collected in this manner only to better understand your needs and the needs of the Website users in the aggregate. Trolley also makes use of information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Website and the specific pages on the Website with a view to introducing improvements.
Your IP address and other relevant information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity, or any activity in violation of the Terms of Use.
11. Verification, Correction and Deletion of Personal Information
You have the right to: (i) verify what Personal Information Trolley holds about you, for how long and for which purposes it is being processed and what safeguards are in place to protect it; (ii) ask for your Personal Information to be corrected or updated; (iii) obtain, to the extent possible, a machine read-able copy of your Personal Information held by us; and (iv) withdraw your consent to the use by Trolley of your Personal Information and have it deleted from our records. If you wish to inquire about and verify and / or correct Personal Information Trolley holds about you, or if you wish to have all your Personal Information permanently deleted from our records, please contact us using the contact information further up in this Policy. Please note that deletion of your Personal Information may make it impossible for you to use the Website, or certain portions thereof. If you request deletion of your Personal Information, Trolley reserves the right to retain some of your Personal Information for a reasonable time in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
12. Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your Home Jurisdiction
Website users may access the Website from any country in the world. Trolley and its third party vendors, including service providers and hosting partners, are located in the United States, Canada, European Economic Area (EEA), and Australia. You acknowledge that Trolley and our third party vendors may be located in jurisdictions or countries where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your home country, state, province or other governmental jurisdiction, and consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to such countries.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, website users, including Registered Users, in the European Union acknowledge and agree that their Personal Information may be transferred to the United States, Canada or Australia.
Where we are responsible for the selection and supervision of third party vendors that process your Personal Data, we will include selection criteria such as the regulatory and data protection regime in the country where the vendor is located, the technical and operational safeguards the vendor has in place with respect to the processing of Personal Information and any other information obtained during a vendor due diligence process. We will put in place a contract with the vendor that ensures the safe and secure processing of Personal Information in compliance with applicable laws.

Furthermore, deleting cookies may prevent certain functions from working at all. Trolley and its Representatives are not responsible for any function that may not operate after you delete cookies, and shall not be liable for any losses or damages (pecuniary or otherwise) arising from those functions not operating, or having reduced functionality.
14. Risks Associated with the Internet
Despite Trolley’s best efforts to ensure that third parties will not access or obtain your Personal Information through your use of the Website, complete confidentiality and security cannot currently be guaranteed on the Internet. Communication via the Internet may be subject to interception, loss, or alteration. You acknowledge and agree that Trolley cannot be held responsible for losses resulting from the transmission of confidential information or Personal Information over the Internet and that such communications are at your own risk, provided always that Trolley provides you with the option to securely communicate in accordance with industry best practices (e.g. standard encryption via commonly used protocols).

Targeting Cookies
These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
Performance Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
Functional Cookies
These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
Always Active
These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
Social Media Cookies
We only place social media cookies if you have given us your permission to do this. Social Media cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make our content and advertising as relevant to you and your interests as possible. These cookies are also used to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns by tracking the number of clicks. The cookies are usually placed by third party advertising networks. They remember the websites you visit and use this information to give you access to interesting and exciting content on our website and to show you more personalized adverts when you visit other websites. These cookies also help improve your browsing experience, for example by helping to prevent the same advertisement from reappearing to you. Additionally, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can use cookies to see if you are logged in and allow you to "like" content or forward it to your friends. Depending on your settings, these third parties may use your information for their own purposes, such as advertising. If you would like to know more how these social media platforms use data, please refer to the privacy notices of these platforms.
