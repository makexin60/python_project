("EA") processes the personal information we collect about you when you use our products and services or when you attend live events hosted by or in connection with EA (collectively, "Services" or "EA Services"). In some cases, our subsidiaries may be considered data controllers, either together with EA or by themselves.
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect depends on what Services you use and how you use them.

B. Information You Provide When Playing Online
ⓘ When you play online, we may collect information about your gaming profile, your gameplay, or your use of social features.

Section 2(D): Anti-Cheat, Inappropriate Content, and Fraud Prevention Technologies
. Please make sure your privacy settings and choices in the features you use reflect your preferences.
When you play our online games, your in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics are collected and some may be visible in-game, as well as visible to players outside the game in other EA Services, such as RaceNet. In some of our titles, we may record your gameplay and replay it to other players in-game and/or make it visible to other players outside the game in other EA Services. Leaderboards may also be available to view by other players outside the game in other EA Services. In competitive game modes, we may record your gameplay, and your controller button inputs, and replay these together with your in-game profile information and game statistics to other players in-game and at live EA or partner events.
C. Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Services
ⓘ We may collect other information when you use our Services, such as information about your device, hardware and software information, IP address, or browser information.

This information is provided to EA as part of establishing or linking an EA Account, which is necessary to access EA’s online services. We may also receive information from the third-party gaming platforms that you use for the purpose of delivering or analyzing the performance of EA marketing. Your use of EA online Services through these third parties indicates your agreement for the transfer of this information. Examples of information we receive when creating EA Accounts for our recently released titles are provided below. We never receive your credit card number or other financial information from these third parties as part of establishing or linking an EA Account.

Other Third Parties
We may receive information from other third parties, like Facebook or Apple Game Center, when you use these services with our games. We may also receive information about you when other players choose to share their contact lists with us or from publicly-available websites.
E. Legal Basis for Processing
ⓘ Depending on where you reside, we may rely on different legal bases to process your information.
Our legal basis for processing your personal information varies depending on the type of information we collect, the context in which we collect it, as well as on your country of residence, as indicated when you are setting up your EA Account or, when not signed into an EA Account, your location as determined by your IP address and/or your device registration country.
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or of a jurisdiction where similar legal requirements may apply such as Brazil, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, we rely on a number of legal bases to process information about you. We will process information about you where we have your consent, where we have a legitimate interest to do so, where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and/or where we have a legal obligation to process your information. For example, we typically rely on:
consent when placing cookies on your device on the web (through our cookie consent manager), to send you email marketing, or to deliver third-party targeted advertising to you on our Services;
our legitimate interests to process your information when providing you with customer service support, to serve targeted EA marketing of our Services, or for fraud prevention and security purposes; and
on contractual necessity to process information when you create an EA Account or otherwise use our Services to enable us to provide you with our Services.
If you are a resident in a territory where our legitimate interests mentioned above are not recognized as a lawful basis under applicable law, we will identify and use other appropriate lawful bases to process your personal information such as contractual necessity or your consent.
2. How We Collect Your Information
ⓘ We use various technologies to deliver and measure the effectiveness of our Services, to serve advertisements, and to enhance your player experience. These technologies include cookies and similar technologies, as well as analytics, advertising, anti-cheat, and anti-fraud technologies.
We and third parties use technologies described below to collect information to deliver our Services.
A. Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We and our third-party partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features, or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, and otherwise enhance your experience. Please refer to
Section 8: Your Choices and Controls
for information on how to manage your cookie preferences.
We may use tracking pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our Services and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our Services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and enforce our User Agreement.
We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat, and Anti-Fraud technologies in our Services. These technologies may utilize the same cookies or similar mechanisms as further described below.
B. Analytics Technologies
We use internal and third-party analytics technologies to collect information about how you use our Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services.
For instance, we may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our Services. This information includes technical and related information about your computer, device, and operating and/or network systems (such as IP Address and device identifiers); information about your engagement with certain features and services; gameplay and usage statistics; as well as system interactions and peripheral hardware. We may also collect and store data from your device to create probabilistic identifiers for the purposes of analyzing the services accessed by our players across devices. If you play a game offline without connecting to the Internet, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to us when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online Services, we may also collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display your personal and/or statistical data regarding your game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.
Third-party analytics technologies integrated into our Services may (including SDK [Software Development Kit] and API [Application Program Interface] integrations) combine the information they collect in connection with your use of EA's Services with information they have independently collected over time and/or across different platforms. Many of these companies collect and use information pursuant to their own privacy policies. A list of third-party analytics companies that operate in our Services as well as how to opt-out to the extent applicable can be found at
privacyappendix.ea.com
.
C. Ad Serving Technologies
Some of our Services employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, SDK, API, and other similar technologies to deliver offers and advertising to you within EA Services as well as on third-party platforms and sites, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices to tailor offers and advertising to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or, if you express interest in a game, you may receive an advertisement later for that game or similar Services on EA or third-party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable offers to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.
These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate offers and advertising to you, to measure effectiveness and distribution of these offers and advertising, and to understand how users interact with our Services. In addition to identifiers and certain information listed in
Section 1(C): Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Services
above, this information may include:
Advertisements served and the location of the ad;
Length of time an advertisement was visible;
Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement;
Your interaction, if any, with the ad; and
Advertisement response.
Third-party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an offer to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected over time and/or across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information pursuant to their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our Services, their privacy notices, as well as how to opt-out to the extent applicable can be found at
privacyappendix.ea.com
.
To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt-out of third-party targeted advertising, you can also visit
www.networkadvertising.org
,
www.aboutads.info/choices
,
youradchoices.ca
, or
www.youronlinechoices.eu
. Note that opting-out does not mean you won't see ads; rather, it means that the advertising you see may not be as relevant to you.
D. Anti-Cheat, Inappropriate Content, and Fraud Prevention Technologies
We strive to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you use our Services, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, collect data about or from your machine or device, which may include a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, and gather other evidence about your gameplay, machine state, or participation in our Services for fraud prevention, security, cheat detection, and authentication purposes. We may also monitor publicly-available information, third-party sites, and/or use anti-cheat technology within our Services, including automated anti-fraud and abuse algorithms. If you believe your access to our games and/or Services was blocked by this technology in error, please contact us at
EA Help
.
We may also monitor, record, review, and retain voice or text communications, and other user-generated Content (“UGC”, as defined in our
User Agreement
), in our Services for purposes of moderating inappropriate Content that violate our policies (like our
Positive Play Charter
). Moderation includes detecting, investigating and removing inappropriate UGC, as well as potentially sanctioning those players whose activities we find as violating our policies.

4. Who May Receive Your Information
ⓘ We may disclose your personal information to the categories of recipients we describe in this section, such as to provide our Services and to deliver advertisements.

We require that any service provider processing your personal information only do so on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy, such as the purposes described in
Section 3: How We Use Your Information

Affiliates and subsidiaries.
We may disclose personal information to other companies in which we have an ownership interest as necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy.
Advertising partners.
Through our Services, we may allow third-party advertising partners to use technologies and other tracking tools to collect information regarding your use of EA's Services and your device (such as your IP address, mobile identifiers, pages visited, location, browser information, time of day). We also may share information relating to your device and your use of our Services with our third-party advertising partners so they may deliver targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party services and websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising," "online behavioral advertising," or "targeted advertising."
Please refer to
Section 2(C): Ad Serving Technologies
for more detail regarding online advertising, as well as
Section 8: Your Choices and Controls
regarding your relevant choices and controls.
Disclosures to protect us or others.
We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity. In particular, if we receive a report that you have violated our policies (like our
Positive Play Charter
), we may disclose that report and other relevant information to the platform on which you play our games.
Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfer.
In the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale, or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law or contract.
Third-party plugins.
When third-party technologies or social tools are integrated into our Services, those third parties may collect information about your use of our Services. An example is the Facebook "Like" button.
In certain instances (such as on our websites), our Services incorporate YouTube videos and use YouTube API Services. This integration is subject to the
YouTube Terms of Service
, and may result in the collection of your personal information by Google according to the
Google Privacy Policy
. If you have authorized us to receive your YouTube or other Google information, such as through logging in to our Services through your Google Account, you may manage your authorization (including revocation) through the
Google Security Settings
. You may also have other rights with respect to your personal information that we have collected, as described in
Section 8: Your Choices and Controls
.
Cross-platform sharing.
Some of our games allow you to connect and play with friends and members of a game's community, regardless of what platform they play on. For example, someone on an Xbox could join a match with a player who is using a PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console. We call this ability to match players across platforms "Cross-Play." When Cross-Play is enabled and you play with someone on another platform, that other platform may receive your platform's ID (such as Xbox Gamertag, or Online ID of your account for PlayStation™Network) along with other information necessary to enable Cross-Play. In addition, we may provide information regarding your use of Cross-Play features to the platform on which you play our games. You can change your Cross-Play preferences by visiting the game's or your platform's settings menus.
Some of our games may also allow you to continue progress on a game between platforms, as well as enable the ability for your purchases on one platform to be available on another platform. We will share your information with platforms to the extent necessary to enable these features.
Other platforms receiving your information may include Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch), Valve (Steam), Epic, and additional platforms as they become available for these features. Your information received by these platforms may be subject to their respective privacy notices.
With your consent.
We may disclose your information to other recipients with your express consent, unless otherwise described above. For example, you may agree to us sharing your information with a certain company or organization to hear about their products, services, or promotions, or if you tell us that you want to link your EA Account with another company’s services. These recipients will process the information you agree to share according to their respective privacy notices.
5. Where We Hold Your Information
ⓘ We store and process your information in the United States and other countries where we operate. When we do this, we utilize technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to meet data transfer requirements set by various privacy laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation.
When you access EA Services, including when available on third-party platforms, your personal information is generally collected by EA directly and processed in the United States. Personal information we collect may be subsequently stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Cookie Policy in the United States or any other country in which EA, its subsidiaries, or third-party agents operate. By consenting to the transfer of your personal data outside of your country of residence, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.

6. How We Protect Your Information
ⓘ We use a range of security measures to secure and protect your information.
Security of your information is a priority at EA and we take a range of technical and organizational measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive information. Even so, please be aware that no security measure is perfect. Thus we cannot guarantee the security of your information at all times. You should always be diligent when it comes to the protection of your personal information. Learn more about
EA Security

7. Children
ⓘ We strive to provide age-appropriate experiences for children. Depending on the age of the child accessing our online Services, parents or guardians may need to provide permission to enable their child to access certain online features of our Services.
Although the majority of EA Services are intended for adults, EA recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children who may access our Services online. We strive to ensure that children who access our Services receive age-appropriate experiences by employing data minimization, privacy by design, and default practices. We consider the best interests of children when determining the age-appropriate experience they receive and take into account the developmental maturity of children of different ages. When children reach the age of majority in their country or territory, they may receive the adult experience.
When players identify themselves as being children under the minimum age of digital consent guidelines set by the law of individual countries or territories, we will:
(1) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, when required by applicable law. For example, we allow parents to create a child EA Account on certain Services, and with parental consent EA will collect and use certain children’s personal information to manage a child EA Account;
(2) disable features in certain Services that could allow a child to share information that directly identifies them, unless a parent has provided relevant consent to us or the third-party platform on which their child is playing. For example, we will respect third-party (console) parental controls as they apply to game features that could allow a child to provide personal information in online or multiplayer games (such as through chat or user generated content);
(3) collect and use certain information for limited purposes only. For example, we may send local in-app notifications, which do not rely on collecting personal information. Also, persistent device identifiers like IP address or advertising device identifier may be collected to support our internal operations, such as:
Delivering the Services;
Maintaining or analyzing the functionality of the Service;
Serving contextual ads or frequency capping;
Protecting the security or integrity of the user of Service; or
Legal or regulatory compliance;
(4) not condition a child's participation in an activity (such as gaming contests) on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. With certain Service-related activities, we may not permit children to participate at all, even if we have consent; and
(5) offer parental controls and choices. If you are a parent or guardian and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, please contact us via the options in
Section 12: Contact Us
. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child's account and/or revert them to the age-appropriate experience, as applicable.
If we make material changes to how we collect, use, share or otherwise process your child's personal information, we will notify parents as required by applicable law.
We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and the risks of disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review the privacy settings applicable to their use of our Services, a summary of which is available on our
Player and Parental Tools page
.
8. Your Choices and Controls
ⓘ We provide you with choice and control about our use of your information, including your ability to exercise your data privacy rights.
We give you meaningful choices when it comes to our collection and use of your information. For example, if you no longer want to receive marketing emails from EA, you may click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of any marketing email we send.
You can learn how to exercise any of your privacy rights by visiting our
My Privacy Rights
portal.
We offer the rights below as provided by applicable law in the countries and jurisdictions in which we offer our Services. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, and state privacy laws enacted in the United States. While we provide additional details where necessary to comply with jurisdiction-specific legal requirements, such as in our section on
Information for California Residents
, these details are illustrative and not intended to limit similar rights that may be available elsewhere.
You may appeal our decision regarding your privacy rights. To do so, please visit our
My Privacy Rights
portal and click on "Other privacy enquiries".
Verification of account ownership.
To protect your account security and personal information, you may be asked to verify your account ownership prior to us processing your request to exercise your data privacy rights. Verification methods include being logged into your EA Account, confirming ownership and access to the email address associated with your account, and/or confirming other unique account details.
Authorized agents.
You can use an authorized agent to make a request to exercise your data privacy rights. Please contact us at
EA Help
to initiate that request. If you use an authorized agent to exercise your right to deletion, access, or correction, we will require that you verify your account ownership directly with us, unless you have provided your agent with a valid power of attorney consistent with California law that includes a comparable proof of account ownership.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information for targeted marketing purposes, we will require your signed permission demonstrating that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf.
Your right to deletion.
You may deactivate your EA Account or delete the personal information associated with your account by contacting us at
EA Help
. If you do so, you will no longer have access to the EA games or Services associated with your account. Note that EA may retain information needed to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreements, protect our legal rights, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our Services. Otherwise, we will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide you with, create, and improve our Services, and to comply with the law.
Your right to access (or "know").
You can access the personal information we hold about you, including the categories of personal information collected, where we collect it from, why and how we use it, and who may receive this information (including to whom it may be sold or shared, as those terms are defined under applicable law). The generally applicable details about our processing are provided in this Policy. With respect to the information specific to our processing of your information, you can download a copy of your EA Account information by
visiting your EA Account
and clicking the "Your EA Data" tab. To receive further details, please contact us at
EA Help
.
Your right to correction.
You can request correction of your personal information where it is inaccurate. In some cases, we may provide self-service tools, such as those on the
EA Account customer portal
, that enable you to update some of your personal information.
Your right to opt-out or object to certain processing.
You may opt-out of targeted advertising, or object to processing of your data based on our legitimate interests, where applicable law provides for such rights. This right is also referred to as the ability to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, as specifically provided by applicable US state privacy laws. To exercise these rights, please see further instructions in our
My Privacy Rights
portal, including the Targeted Advertising Provided by Third Parties section.
Cookie Controls.
If you are in a location whose laws may require additional choices, you can control cookies and similar technologies used on most EA sites for certain optional functional and advertising analytics and targeted advertising purposes via the banner that appears at the bottom of the webpage during your first visit. You can also disable some cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.
The effect of your choice will depend on the context in which you exercise it:
If you opt-out of having your information shared for purposes of targeted advertising on PC and console through your EA Account, your choice will take effect for any PC and console games that you have logged into with your EA Account.
If you opt-out of having your information shared for purposes of targeted advertising through one of our mobile game settings, your choice will take effect for that mobile game.
If you opt-out of having your information shared for purposes of web targeted advertising through our cookies controls, your choice will take effect when visiting our websites through the browser and device on which you made that choice.
Global Privacy Control.
In certain regions, we recognize an opt-out preference signal sent by your web browser (sometimes referred to as the Global Privacy Control or "GPC") as a valid request to opt-out of the sale and sharing of the personal information processed via the browser you are using. In practice this controls whether your browser loads third-party cookies on our Services' websites that are used for targeted advertising, or may otherwise be considered a sale or sharing of personal information. We process this signal only based on browser settings, so you would need to set them separately for different browsers on the same device and across devices. Please review the
list of browsers that support GPC and associated instructions
on how to enable it. GPC does not control targeted advertising in our PC, console, or mobile games and must be changed via your account or the game's settings, as described above.
You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of these privacy rights.
9. Third-Party Services
ⓘ Our websites and Services may contain ads or links to third-party services and sites.
Our websites and Services may contain advertising or links to third-party services (such as the Facebook "Like" button or links to third-party websites). If you click on those links, including an advertisement, you will leave the EA Service and go to the third-party service or site that you selected. If you visit a third-party website or use a third-party service, you should consult that service's or site's privacy policy as your use of third-party sites or services is governed by their privacy policies.
