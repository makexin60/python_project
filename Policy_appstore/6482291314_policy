Should new purposes arise for processing your personal data, we will inform you of any such changes by updating this Privacy Policy accordingly before commencing the processing of information for those additional purposes.
We may de-identify or anonymize your information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.
We also may combine your de-identified information with that of other users to create aggregate de-identified data that may be disclosed to third parties who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience. For example, we may use information gathered to create a composite profile of all the users of the Services to understand community needs, to design appropriate features and activities. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a 
partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.
