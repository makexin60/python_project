Privacy Policy
DFM Systems ("we," "us," or "our") develops software applications ("Services") provided at no cost and intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform users of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information for anyone choosing to use our Services.
By using our Services, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this policy. Our Services do not collect Personal Information unless explicitly stated. Any information collected, such as photos or data, is related solely to the functionality of the Services and not to identify or track users.
Information Collection and Use
Our Services allow users to log in to systems they have already subscribed to through other products we offer. While using our Services, we may request access to certain information necessary for the app's functionality, such as:
Photos or images related to asset verification or management (no photos of people are collected).
We do not collect user data like names, addresses, location data, or other personally identifiable information. Information processed in our Services is retained only on the user's device unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Log Data
Currently, we do not collect log data from our users. However, in the future, we may integrate tools like Firebase Crashlytics for error reporting, which may collect non-personal information about device performance in case of an error.
Cookies
Our Services do not use cookies. Additionally, no third-party code or libraries that use cookies are currently integrated into our applications.
Service Providers
At this time, our Services do not share or transmit any data to third parties. All data remains within the app, and no personal information is collected or passed to external providers.
Security
We prioritize the security of the data processed within our Services and use encrypted communication (HTTPS) to ensure privacy during data transmission. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Links to Other Sites
Our Services may contain links to external websites, such as Notion pages that we have authored. These are not third-party links but resources created and maintained by DFM Systems. We advise users to review any external links carefully as we do not control third-party sites outside of our own.
Childrenâ€™s Privacy
Our Services are not designed for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children, nor is any content harmful or inappropriate for minors. Our applications focus on viewing documents, and conducting workflows, and are intended for use in professional or enterprise environments.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and you are encouraged to review this page periodically for any updates. Changes will take effect immediately upon being posted.
