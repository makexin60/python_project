Privacy Policy
1.0 Our basic principles about user privacy and data protection
User privacy and personal data protection are rights that we care about and respect, in accordance with applicable law. Data should only be collected and processed when strictly necessary, and then deleted if it is no longer needed. We do not tolerate or create spam (unsolicited emails). We do not sell, rent, distribute or make public the personal data of users.
2.0 Relevant legislation
This website complies with the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
. Even if this regulation is only applicable in the European Union, it is most likely compatible with the relevant legislation in other countries.
3.0 The personal data we collect and the reason why we do it
This website collects and uses personal information for the following reasons:
3.1 Visitor statistics
Like most websites, it uses Goolge Analytics (GA) to collect visitor statistics. We use this data to find out the number of visitors, how they get to the site and how they navigate the pages of the site.
Even if GA records the geographical location, device, internet browser, operating system and other information about visitors, none of this information allows us to personally identify them. GA also records the IP addresses of visitors, which could be used for personal identification, but we do not have access to them.
GA uses cookies, details of which you can find
here
. If cookies are disabled, GA will not record visitor data.
3.2 Registering an account on the site
In order to post their own recipes on the site, comments or to participate in contests, visitors must register an account on the site. This can be done either with the help of an existing visitor account on a partner platform (such as Facebook or Google), or through your own registration system on the site, using only the email address. Visitors who register through the partner platforms must give their consent to transmit to the site, in a secure way, the following personal information: email address, name, surname, username, avatar (picture) - if any. The site's own registration process requires at least an email address and a username, and after registration the user can optionally complete his profile with name, surname, picture. All personal data collected in the registration process is saved encrypted according to the latest security standards.
All personal data associated with a user account, as well as recipes, comments and records about contest participation activities will be kept indefinitely, but users have the opportunity to request their deletion by email to admin@bylena.com on the email address associated with the account.
Visitors under the age of 16 MUST have parental consent to register an account on the site.
Users of the site should not write personal information in comments and recipes, as they are publicly accessible and cannot be protected.
The personal data from the accounts registered on the site are not in any form transmitted to third parties.

Also, the subscription can be made at any time from the My Account page. The email and the names of the subscribers to the newsletter will be stored in the database of the site in an encrypted form and will not be transmitted in any form to third parties. Newsletter subscribers will receive by email mainly new recipes published on the site (usually no more than 2-3 per week). Unsubscribing from the newsletter can be done automatically either by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email, or from the My Account page (if it has an account). Also, unsubscribing can be done by an email with this request sent to admin@bylena.com from the email address requesting the unsubscription.
People under the age of 16 MUST have parental consent to subscribe to the site's newsletter.
