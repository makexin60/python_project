As a cyber security company, your privacy and safety online is our core concern and protecting them is our mission. In this document, we explain the types of personal information that we collect and record on
https://heimdalsecurity.com
and how we use this data.
The document also includes details as to how may use the data we collect on this website, how we protect it and how you may correct it.
This privacy policy and license agreement applies to all websites managed by Heimdal, but also to all Heimdal products and services.
The Heimdal software (Software) and all the intellectual property rights pertaining to this Software are owned by Heimdal Security A/S (HEIMDAL), located on Vester Farimagsgade Street, number 1, Floor 2, in Copenhagen V, Postal Code 1606.
Heimdal License Agreement for Enterprise Users
1. Grant of license
This License Agreement (hereafter "License") grants to you, and you accept, a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the Heimdal software and Service (hereafter the "Software" and the "Service") including any patches and associated documentation (hereafter "Documentation") subject to the terms set forth herein. HEIMDAL reserves the right to supplement or amend the terms herein with terms transpiring from the Software itself and accepted by you during installation or updating.
This License does not convey to you with an interest or ownership in or to the Software, but only a limited right of use always subject to the terms of this License.
Using the free version of the Software (Heimdal FREE) in Enterprise settings, for professional use, is not permitted. If the version you have downloaded requires a valid license key, the Software will not run until the valid license key has been installed. You will receive your valid license key via e-mail from HEIMDAL directly.
Depending on the license you have purchased, HEIMDAL permits you to:
Copy the Software onto a single computer or onto multiple computers owned by you or operated by a third-party for your benefit (outsourced IT) at a single location, where "location" is defined as one (1) physical location unless you have a professional license, which will allow you to use the Software on more than one location operated by the same legal entity or Group as have been agreed with HEIMDAL.
The number of licenses in use is subject to random testing by Heimdal Security and will be adjusted to meet the actual usage if necessary. The Heimdal products Threat Prevention, Patch and Asset Management, NGAV+XTP, Ransomware Encryption Protection, Privilege Elevation and Delegation Management, Application Control on a per device basis. Email Fraud Protection, when installed on the Endpoint is per device. Products configured on MX Record E-mail services, E-Mail Security and E-Mail Fraud, are user based.
Remote Desktop Control is licensed on per admin basis.
Devices are made up of either standalone or in combination, Hostname/Motherboard ID/Harddrive ID. User-based product licensing for Heimdal products, such as MX record-based E-Mail services, is made up of unique users defined as unique E-mail addresses receiving more than 5 e-mails a month or Azure AD users.
It is solely the responsibility of the customer to revoke devices or users that are not in use. Heimdal measures license consumption on a 30 day period, as opposed to the industry standard of 12 months, which makes it much more favourable for the customer.
Ransomware Encryption Protection usage is charged on the Azure AD usage or device count, whichever of the 2 is higher.
Operated at a location shall also include portable computers (laptops and the like) if the computer in question is normally operated at that single location or its primary user has it working place at that location.
2. Restrictions
You agree to maintain all copyright notices on any full and partial copies of the Software. You must not use or allow any third party to use the Software in any manner that may infringe any intellectual property rights, including without limitation patents, copyrights, and trademark rights or any proprietary or trade secret interests.

3. Terms of license
This License becomes effective ("Effective Date") upon entering the valid license key received via e-mail from HEIMDAL, or upon your use of the Software, whichever occurs first, at which date you are considered to have accepted this License, and shall continue until terminated by either party or breached by you.
HEIMDAL may at its discretion disable the Software and/or terminate this License upon the breach of any term hereof, including (i) if applicable license or maintenance fees (if applicable) are not paid on time, (ii) if a third party instructed, engaged or allowed access by you, amend, modify, make additions, deletions or changes to the Software; or (iii) if you make or permit any third party to make unauthorized copies of the Software; or, (iv) if you fail to comply with any other provision of this License.

HEIMDAL will have “zero-tolerance” in regards to any infringements with any International Sanctions Law, standards, and regulation, especially with the ones imposed by the Directive (EU) 2018/843 of the European Parliament on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing. Also, HEIMDAL is expecting you to comply with all the provisions set in the HEIMDAL’S CODE OF CONDUCT ON COMPLIANCE WITH SANCTIONS & EMBARGOES AND RESTRICTED INDUSTRIES and HEIMDAL’S CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BUSINESS PARTNERS.

If you do not terminate, HEIMDAL will renew and bill you for the usage that you have of the product under the old license terms and/or the previous licensed volume.

How do we share information?
We may share your personal information with any other companies that are part of the Heimdal™ Security A/S.
We may also share your information with selected third-parties outside of the Heimdal™ Security A/S including:

Any business partners, suppliers, and subcontractors we work with to provide you with the products and services you have requested from us.
Credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.

Advertisers and advertising network that require the data to select and serve related adverts to you and others.
Enterprise data
Heimdal™ Security A/S will not share any enterprise data entrusted to us by customers.
We may also share your personal data with third parties on a one-off basis, for example, if:
we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
If Heimdal Security A/S or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets;
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements entered into with you or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Heimdal Security A/S and its staff, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
We work with third-party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who use advertising or related products, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world.
Here are the types of third parties we can share information with about you: Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services (Non-Personally Identifiable Information Only).
We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year old female, in Madrid, who likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers.
Vendors, service providers, and other partners.
We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other partners who globally support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Data Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
How do we protect your data?
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help guard your data in compliance with applicable privacy regulations. If transactions are offered on the Services, transaction information is transmitted to and from the Service in encrypted form using industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS used to be known as SSL) connections to help protect such information from interception. We strictly restrict authorized access to your data only to those persons who have a legitimate purpose to access it. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the data we process, like:
only storing your personal data on our secure servers;
using specialist third-party payment providers to process payments made through our site (read more in the section on "Making payments through our site";
ensuring that our staff receive regular data security awareness training;
keeping paper records to a minimum and ensuring that those we do have are stored in our locked offices;
We encrypt many of our services using SSL and we encrypt the data we store
2 or 3-factor authentications for logins
We encourage you to be careful when sharing your data with other users when you use our Services like email or chats. Heimdal will NEVER ask for your password to be sent separately or in clear text. Anyone doing so is probably trying to steal your stuff.

Here we have to inform about the possibility to opt-in or opt-out from email for example

How long will we keep your data?
We will keep your information for as long as you are a customer of Heimdal Security A/S. We may keep your information for longer for research or statistical purposes. If we do, we will make sure your information is anonymized and non-traceable to you as a person. We will also keep it for longer if we cannot delete it for legal or regulatory reasons. We will, however, delete all data that is no longer necessary after a reasonable period. For example, any inactive Heimdal Account will after a period of two (2) years be deleted unless they contained products you have purchased as we assume you would rather not have them deleted.
We will also delete data upon request.
Making payments through our site
All our payments are made through payment processors over a secure connection. Only the payment processors store your full payment card number or account information. During the order process, you will be directed on to pages hosted by our payment processor.

clicking on the unsubscribe or opt-out link that appears in each of our marketing emails;
updating your preference settings via your Heimdal Dashboard account;
We never share your contact details with third parties for marketing purposes but we do partner with a third-party advertising network to display advertising on the site and to manage our advertising on other websites. Our advertising network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect information about your activities on the site and on other websites and uses this to provide you with targeted advertising based on your interests. Please note that opting out of receiving targeted advertising will not prevent you from receiving generic advertising.
What about links to third-party sites?
Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers, and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
Children’s Information
We believe it is important to provide enhanced protection for children online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to observe, participate in and/or monitor and guide their online activity.
Heimdal Security does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian believes that Heimdal Security, through its products, websites or services, has in its database the personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please contact us immediately (using the contact in the first paragraph) and we will use our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.
