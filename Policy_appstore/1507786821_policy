Privacy Policy
At FoodShiner, we respect your privacy. We believe that the less we know about you, the better; that is why we aim to limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you in details about which data we collect or log when you use our application and how that data is being used and where is being stored.
Data Collection
Beyond the information Apple provides to developers (provided you opt-in), FoodShiner uses no third-party analytics frameworks. FoodShiner does neither log nor collect any personal information or usage data when using the application.
In TestFlight beta builds, FoodShiner may log crash reports to your device that you can explicitly choose to share (it will not leave your device otherwise). These reports do not contain any identifiable information. Simply put, your data is your data, and it will not be shared in any form to any third-parties.
Data Storage
FoodShiner stores all the data in a local database. If the user desires to have FoodShiner data synced across all the devices or want to share it with other persons on this case the user can choose to activate iCloud Sync. You can at any given time disable iCloud Sync from FoodShiner settings and even delete the data stored in the cloud.
FoodShiner uses specifically the CloudKit portion of iCloud, and all your data is stored in your own private CloudKit database located in Apple cloud servers. None of this data is stored on any servers controlled by FoodShiner. Furthermore, we have no access to any of your data in iCloud, as Apple does not give developers access to data in a user‘s private CloudKit database.
Any data stored in iCloud is subject to
Apple‘s privacy policy

When you sign in with your Apple Account, you will enable services such as iCloud, the App Store, iMessage, and Find My on this iPhone.
Certain data, including your contacts, calendars, photos, documents, health, activity, and other app data, will be sent to Apple to store and back up on your behalf.
In addition, your device will be associated with your Apple Account to provide you with better service and support.
Your Apple Account and all Apple services are designed from the ground up to protect your privacy. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better. When we do collect data, we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices.
An Apple Account is the personal account you use to access Apple services like iCloud, the App Store and other Apple online stores, iMessage, and FaceTime, and to access your content across all your devices and the web. Your Apple Account includes the information you use to sign in, as well as all the contact, payment, and security details, such as trusted phone numbers or security questions, that you use across Apple services. Apple retains your device’s name, serial number, and other hardware identifiers to provide you with better service and support, including as a convenience to display the warranty status of your device and to check your eligibility for service offers when you activate a device. You can edit your Apple Account information and view a list of your devices and phone numbers on your Apple Account page at
account.apple.com
.
When you sign in with your Apple Account, you will enable services such as iCloud, the App Store, iMessage, FaceTime, and Find My on this iPhone. Your Apple Account information, including your associated phone number, will be used with each service, which will generate analytics information that may be used to maintain and improve those services. Additionally, certain data from your device, including your selected profile photo, your contacts, calendars, photos, documents, health, activity, Safari tabs, and other app data, will be sent to Apple to store and back up on your behalf.
Apple collects information associated with your Apple Account to determine whether your device is eligible for certain legally required features and services, which are based on the country or region in which your device is located. We also collect information about the apps you install, including from where you install them (for example, a website or app marketplace), associated with your Apple Account for accounting, reporting, analytics, and fraud detection purposes in connection with the enablement of these legally required features and services. In addition, we use the age associated with your Apple Account to comply with our obligations, including providing age-appropriate information about your privacy rights in certain cases.
iCloud and Privacy
Signing in to iCloud
When you use iCloud, certain data you store on your device will be automatically sent to and stored by Apple. This allows you to access your data on all your iCloud-enabled devices or computers (“devices”) automatically. This data may include:
Contacts
Calendars
Reminders
Bookmarks
Safari tabs
Health data
Home data
Notes
Freeform
Photos
Documents
Wallet data
Keychain and passwords
Phone number on your device
Device and account settings
Data from other Apple apps that use iCloud
Data from third-party apps that use iCloud
iCloud Backup is also enabled to help ensure you have a current backup of the data on your device in case you need to replace or restore it.
You can adjust which iCloud features are enabled and what data is sent to iCloud from Settings on your device at any time.
iCloud Data Security
iCloud protects your information by encrypting it when it’s in transit, storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication. For certain information, Apple uses end-to-end encryption. This means that, by design, only you can access this information, and only on devices where you’re signed in to iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information. For more information on iCloud Data Security, visit
support.apple.com/102651
.
Both Apple and third-party data centers may be used to store and process your data. When processing data stored in a third-party data center, encryption keys are accessed only by Apple software running on secure servers, and only while conducting the necessary processing.
iCloud Keychain
iCloud Keychain keeps your Safari website usernames and passwords, credit card information, and Wi-Fi network information up to date and available across all your devices. It can also store the account information you use for Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Messages, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other internet accounts and automatically add this information to all of your devices.
iCloud Keychain uses end-to-end encryption and is designed so that only you can access this information and only on devices where you’re signed in to iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access your iCloud keychain data. You can choose to turn off iCloud Keychain in your iCloud settings at any time.
iCloud Backup
When you use iCloud Backup, your backup may include photos, videos, messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), Health and other app data, location settings (such as location-based reminders that you have set up), Visual Voicemail, device settings, device characteristics, and other data from your iOS or iPadOS device depending on your Settings.
You can stop iCloud from backing up your app data for a particular app by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups, selecting your iOS or iPadOS device in the Backups section, and tapping to turn off the apps for which you’d like to disable backup.
You can turn off iCloud Backup entirely from iCloud settings and use Finder (macOS Catalina 10.15 or later) or iTunes (macOS Mojave 10.14 or earlier) to back up your iOS or iPadOS device to your computer. To completely remove your backup data from iCloud, you can delete your individual backups before turning off iCloud Backup. Otherwise, the backup data will be retained for up to 180 days.
Sharing Data with iCloud
If you use iCloud to share files either publicly or privately in Notes, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Freeform, and certain third-party apps, Apple will store and have access to the shared file. Your first and last name associated with your account (if applicable), the phone number on your device, and the file name will be available to anyone who has access to the sharing link, regardless of whether your share is private or public. The identities of private share participants will not be made available to anyone who has not been invited to and accepted the private share.
If you create or join a Shared Library, all participants can add, edit, or delete photos and videos in the Shared Library through iCloud. There are several ways to add content to a Shared Library either manually or with automatic sharing. You can control how you want to share content by going to Settings > Photos > Shared Library > Share from Camera on your iOS or iPadOS device.
iCloud and Apps
Some apps use iCloud to store data and content you provide to the app, so you can access the data across all your iCloud-enabled devices. The app may choose to store some or all of your data in iCloud. Third-party apps can request to look you up, so that other users of that application can see your first and last name when they search by Apple Account.
You can stop an app from storing data in iCloud by turning off its access to iCloud. To do so, go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud, and tap to turn off apps shown in the list.
Apple Services That Require iCloud
To use Apple services like Apple Pay, Activity sharing, Home, Handoff, Universal Clipboard, and Unlock with Apple Watch, you must be signed in to iCloud on your device. Apple uses your iCloud plan to verify your eligibility to set up and use Secure Camera Recording in the Home app. Apple can’t access the content of your camera recordings. You do not need to use all iCloud features and can turn off any iCloud features you don’t want to use in iCloud settings on your device.
Signing Out of iCloud
If you want to stop using iCloud on your iOS or iPadOS device and any paired Apple Watch, you can sign out of iCloud by going to Settings > [your name] and tapping Sign Out. To stop using iCloud on your Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] and click Sign Out. Your Apple Account password may be required.
Communicating with You
Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own, the Apple apps you download, devices registered to your account, and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about iCloud and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, including Apple One. Your device serial number may be used to check eligibility for service offers. If you are in a Family Sharing group, Apple may send you communications about products, services, and offers available to you through Family Sharing. If you purchase an Apple One subscription, we may send you communications about the features of each of the services for which you have subscribed.
Email Marketing
You may receive these communications by email, if you consent to receive email marketing. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to
account.apple.com
, or on your iOS or iPadOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > Personal Information.
Push Notifications
You may also receive these communications by push notification. To update your notification preferences or to opt out of notifications on your iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > Notifications.
Family Sharing
Family Sharing lets you and your family group share subscriptions, purchases, and location. The family organizer can set up parental controls such as Ask to Buy and Screen Time for children in the family group. If a member of your family group signs in to certain Apple devices, such as Apple TV, the device may suggest adding other members of your family by displaying their Apple Account name and profile photo. For more information on Family Sharing, visit
www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/family-sharing
.
iMessage, FaceTime, and iCloud
When you sign in with your Apple Account on your iPhone, you will be signed in to iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud, and other Apple services automatically. The phone number on your device will also be verified and associated with your Apple Account. Your Apple Account or phone numbers will be shown to the people you contact or share data with, and people can reach you using your Apple Account, and email addresses or phone numbers on your account. You can choose how people can reach you by going to Settings > [your name] > Personal Information. You can also learn more about iMessage and FaceTime and Privacy by going to Settings > Messages and tapping About iMessage and FaceTime & Privacy.
iTunes and App Store and Music
When you sign in with your Apple Account on your iPhone, you will be signed in to the iTunes Store, the App Store, and Apple Music automatically so that you can make purchases or begin using Apple Music quickly and easily. Any purchases you choose to make will be recorded in our systems so you can redownload them at any time. If you use Apple Music, your listening history may be retained and used to help provide personalized recommendations. You can choose not to share your listening history from Apple Music settings.
If iTunes Match is available in your region and you use iTunes Match, iCloud will collect information about media in your iTunes library, and either match media to songs currently available in the iTunes Store or upload songs that cannot be matched, after which those songs can be accessed by your eligible devices.
Apple Subscriptions Through Partners
If your mobile network provider or another Apple partner offers subscriptions and free trials to Apple services (such as Apple One, Apple Music, or Apple TV+) Apple will use your phone number or a unique account identifier shared by the partner to identify the free trial or subscription, verify your account at sign in, and to connect your Apple subscription or free trial to your Apple Account. We will also use the phone number or unique account identifier to let the mobile network provider or partner know that you have activated your free trial or subscription.
Payment Methods, Gift Cards, and Adding Funds to Apple Account Balance
To make purchases from the App Store, iTunes, Music, and more, you must add a valid payment method to your Apple Account. To add a payment method on iOS, go to Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping, tap Add Payment Method, and add relevant payment details. You may add payment details by manually entering information or taking a picture of your payment card. If you choose to add payment details by taking a picture of your payment card, your device will pull the relevant information from the image to populate the required fields; the image will not be seen or stored by Apple. Apple collects and stores the payment method details that you provide, including account number and expiration date, to carry out your purchases, comply with law, and to prevent fraud. You may also provide Apple with a billing and shipping address, which may be used for marketing and analytics purposes, as well as to comply with law and prevent fraud.
When you use a payment card, Apple may retain and automatically update your card number and billing information for future purchases, recurring transactions, or other uses you authorize. Apple may obtain this information from your financial institution or payment network, and also use it for fraud prevention and verification.
If you have enabled Apple Pay, Apple will also check whether any Apple Pay payment methods are eligible to be added as a payment method on file to your Apple Account and display those payment methods below Found in Wallet. When you conduct a transaction with your Apple Account, Apple may also check whether any Apple Account payment methods on file are eligible for Apple Pay. If so, to help safeguard your payment information, Apple may enable Apple Pay for that payment method. You can modify your payment methods at any time by going to Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping.
You may purchase an Apple gift card using a payment method associated with your Apple Account and share the gift card with a recipient by providing Apple with their email address, your name, and the gift card amount. You may also enter a message if you so choose. Apple will use recipient information for purposes of gift card sales and redemptions, to comply with law, and to prevent fraud.
You may also redeem an Apple gift card by applying the gift card value to your Apple Account balance. When you redeem an Apple gift card, information about the gift card will be associated with your Apple Account balance and may be used by Apple to comply with law and to prevent fraud. Certain information about your gift card redemption, such as the number of gift cards that you have redeemed, may also be used to personalize your redemption experience and communications from Apple to you. You may opt out of use of gift card information for personalization by going to the iTunes Store, scrolling to the bottom, tapping Apple Account > View Apple Account and tapping to turn off Personalized Recommendations.
You may add funds directly to your Apple Account balance using your payment method on file. When you add funds to your Apple Account balance, you may have the option to set automatic amount or time intervals for recurring funds increases. When you set up automatic funds increases, you will receive communications from Apple on your device or by email concerning your balance or recurring funds increases (for example confirmation notices, receipts, and reminders once you’ve enrolled). You can update or stop the automatic funds increases at any time in your Apple Account settings.
After you redeem a gift card or add funds to your Apple Account balance, your updated Apple Account balance will be visible in Wallet so that you can easily use your Apple Account balance for Apple Store purchases.
To improve your experience with payment methods, gift cards, and adding funds to your Apple Account balance, Apple may collect certain data about your interactions, including your clicks and taps, with your Apple Account payment settings.
Subscription Management
You can view and manage your subscriptions to Apple services and third-party services purchased through Apple’s in-app purchase system in your Apple Account Settings. On iOS, go to Settings > [your name] > Subscriptions. To view the details of, manage, and cancel an active or recently active subscription, tap the subscription. You may also manage the sharing of your subscription with your family if you are in an iCloud family, as well as your Renewal Receipt preferences. When you view and manage your subscription through your Apple Account, Apple may use receipt information provided to developers at the time of your subscription purchase to request from the developer any messaging or offers that they would like Apple to display to you. Apple does not store or otherwise use for our own purposes the content of the messages that we display on the developer’s behalf, but the request for messages may indicate to the developer that you are managing your subscription, and Apple may collect information about whether and what type of message was displayed. To improve your experience with subscription management, Apple may collect data about your interactions, including what you view, click, and tap, within your Apple Account Subscription settings.
School and Business Organizations
If the email address you associate with your Apple Account uses a domain controlled by an Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager organization, Apple may share your email address with the organization after it verifies that it controls the domain. The organization may prevent your email address from being associated with your Apple Account by allowing you to transfer your account to a work or school account or by reclaiming your email address. If you choose to transfer your account, Apple may check various account characteristics to determine eligibility, such as your subscriptions and purchases, payment methods and remaining balances, and whether your account is part of a Family Sharing group. If your account is eligible, you can opt in to transfer your Apple Account to a work or school account managed by the organization, which will allow the organization to access all data associated with the account. If your account is not eligible, or you do not want to opt in, you will need to update the email address associated with your Apple Account. For more information on transferring your account, including the full list of account characteristics, and updating your email address, visit
support.apple.com/102159
.
Usage Data
We also collect data on your use of iCloud to provide and improve the quality of the service. To help address customer issues if they arise, some of this data may be associated with your Apple Account. We may use your IP address to determine the city and country from which you are accessing the service, but we do not retain it.
Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We process your Apple Account and the associated information described above generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service, and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable local law.
Where applicable law provides, we process the following categories of personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party, including information about:
Your Apple Account, including information you use to sign in, as well as all the contact, payment, and security details, such as trusted phone numbers or security questions, that you use across Apple services
The apps you install, including from where you install them (for example, a website or app marketplace)
Whether your device is eligible for certain legally required services and features based on the country or region in which it is located
Your devices, including your device’s name, serial number, and other hardware identifiers
Your use of, and subscriptions to, various Apple services, such as iCloud, the iTunes Store, the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple One
Payment details, including account numbers and expiration dates, billing and shipping addresses, and gift card redemption information
These legitimate interests include:
Providing you and others with better service and support, and for accounting, reporting, and analytics purposes
Determining the availability of and enabling legally required features and services
Using your data to send you offers via email and push notifications that may be of interest to you
Checking eligibility for offers
Preventing fraud and other malicious activity
Retention
Where you make a purchase such as a subscription, we retain personal data associated with your purchase for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting, which vary by region. For most customers, that requires at least a 10-year retention period, but in regions such as China that period can be 30 years. We may also retain a record of your interactions with iCloud-related services. These records are typically stored for 30 days but may be stored for up to three years in an aggregated form, unless we are required by law or legal process to store them for a longer period.
If you delete your Apple Account, we retain a record of the deleted account to comply with legal obligations, including as described above, and for so long as necessary for the legitimate interests of account security. If you choose to create a new account later, you will need to use an email address that is not associated with the account you have requested we delete. If you used a phone number to create your account, it cannot be used to create another account for the same reasons. You will not be able to remove the primary email address for the account or the phone number if you used it to create the account. We may also be required to retain information to comply with a court settlement or other equivalent mandated process.
Where we delete an account, we make our best efforts to delete all personal data associated with your account. If we delete your personal data, we will both render certain personal data about you permanently unrecoverable and also deidentify certain personal data.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
www.apple.com/privacy
.
