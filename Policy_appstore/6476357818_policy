Using Lynk as a Lynk Driver
You must register with Lynk, providing Lynk with accurate and up to date information further to which you shall be entitled to use the Product in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Once you have provided your details to Lynk we will contact you using the contact details that you provided to Lynk regarding your application.
You are not an employee of Lynk but rather are entering into an arrangement with Lynk whereby you will use the Product and/or the equipment and share the proceeds of the customer price or fare with Lynk (as described below).
When you are using the Lynk Driver app, whether it is on and open (active) or asleep, you acknowledge and accept that the Lynk Driver app will track you. When the application is closed properly it does not track you.
Lynk’s Driver app uses Google Navigation which often displays routes that are NOT the shortest route. However, under Regulation you are obliged to take the shortest route and you accept this and agree to do so.
Customers will make a booking through the app, website, other electronic means or by phone and you will collect the passenger or goods and electronically mark the job as completed on completion. You may nominate another person to carry out a booking on your behalf provided that person can show that they are legally entitled to drive the car being used for the booking. For the purposes of regulatory and legal compliance, and for processing and tracking, you must inform Lynk of the arrangement and you must ensure that the substitute driver is registered with Lynk and with the NTA.
When active on the app, you should update the status of your availability to be seen as an available driver.
You agree and accept that your photo, or a copy of your photo,taken live, or copied from your licence or copied from the Driver Check Appwill be published on the Lynk passenger app.
You acknowledge that under these Terms and Conditions you are not permitted to display the branding of any other service.
Lynk is under no obligation to provide you with a minimum amount of booking request options. You are not required to accept any booking requests nor are you required to complete a minimum amount of bookings in any given month or year.
You are not required to be available during any particular hours of business nor are you required to be available for any minimum period of hours in a given month or year. You may choose to be available or unavailable at any time and for any period of time that suits you, within the bounds of the law.

Freight may be a percentage of each fare (sometimes called commission or percentage) a fixed value per fare ([sometimes called pay-per-job or PPJ or booking feeor hospitality charge (‘hospitality’ refers to bookings from clients such as hotels, restaurants, bars, social establishments, clubs)],) or any combination of these amounts.
Full Freight is the highest level of Freight required by Lynk to be paid by the driver on a weekly basis.
In the case of a fleet package or fleet agreement, where Lynk has provided you with additional SPSV items essential to the operation of a taxi, up to and including a complete taxi, Freight is charged at a higher rate than owner driver Freight due to additional items supplied to you and this is known as Fleet Freight.
Lynk has various driver packages from which you, the driver, may choose. If you fail to choose a package but nevertheless proceed to take and complete bookings on the Lynk driver App you will be charged Freight based on the Full Access package as priced and described on Lynk.ie/driver/

These deductions are called Levies and are passed on to you at cost price.
You agree to pay any Freight Charges applied to your account or to completed bookings and you accept that Lynk may deduct such amounts from your account.
Freight Charges, as described below, may be applied to your account as line items or may be deducted at source. Charges are applied as follows:
Freight is charged as a line item – Lynk’s share of the fare
Commission or percentage Freight is charged as a line item – Lynk’s share of the fare
Pay-Per-Job, PPJ, booking fee Freight is deducted from the fare before the fare is applied to your account – Lynk’s share of the fare

We may transfer our rights and obligations under this EULA to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this EULA.
You may only transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA to another person if we agree in writing
If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
Each of the conditions of this EULA operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.
LYNK- TERMS OF USE
SECTION A: INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY TERMS
This section contains information about the Lynk platform and the App and Lynk Services through which we make the platform available to you. It also explains the relationship between Users and Operators and our relationship to them. We describe in this section how to access the Services using the App and provide a link to our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy describes the personal information we collect from you when using the Services and App and the purposes for which we use that information.
Welcome
These Term of Use apply to your use of the services Lynk (we, you or us, as applicable) provide to you through the mobile software application that we make available for download (App) from certain third party retailers (App Stores). For further information about us and our contact details, please see the Contact us section at the end of this page
The terms and conditions of the software licence of the App are set out in our End User Licence agreement (EULA) and together, with these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy (collectively the Terms), govern the services you access and use through the App (Lynk Services). They all form part of our agreement with you so please take the time to read them.
To make these terms and conditions quicker to read, we use a few definitions. We refer to users that have registered an account to use Lynk Services via the App as Users, to the third party operators of licensed private hire vehicles that Users can book using the App as Operators, to the transportation services provided by Operators as Transportation Services, to the booking a User makes for Transportation Services using the App as Bookings and to the electronic mobile device that a User uses to run the App as a Device.
These Terms of Use are organised into three sections. Those terms and conditions in Section B apply specifically to Users that make a Booking. Those in this Section A and in Section C apply to all Users.
You will see that each section of these Terms begins with a ‘highlight’ text box which summarises the key terms in that section. These highlights are an informal summary and do not form part of these Terms or any of the contracts made between us.
Please read these Terms carefully before you download the App, start to use the Lynk Services or make a Booking, as these will apply to your use of the App and the Lynk Services available through it. In particular, please read the terms relating to the limitations of our liability to you below in Promises, liability and disclaimer under paragraph 18, before making Booking.
By using our App and the Lynk Services, you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not accept these Terms, you should not use the App or the Lynk Services.
We may revise these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy from time to time in accordance with the provisions under ‘Changes to these Terms of Use’ in Section C so please check these Terms regularly to ensure you understand the Terms which will apply at that time you make a Booking. These Terms of Use were most recently updated on the date of posting that appears at the top of this page.
If you have any queries or concerns regarding these Terms or require any technical assistance in relation to the App, please contact us at
customercare@lynk.ie
.
The Lynk platform and our role
We provide a platform, comprising the App and Lynk Services, which allows Users to obtain fare estimates and book Transportation Services with Operators from their Device using the App. Accordingly, our role is to facilitate Bookings and transactions between Users and Operators through provision of the App and Lynk Services. We are not an agent of the Operators and we have no continuing authority to negotiate, deal with, manage, conduct or conclude any Bookings for, or the sale or purchase of, Transportation Services on behalf of Operators.
We are not involved in, and bear no responsibility for, the actual transactions between Users Operators. The contract for the provision of Transportation Services is made directly between the User and the Operator (Contract).
Whilst we may provide relevant information from the Operator as part of our Services (e.g. price estimates), such information is for information only. We have no control over, and are not in any way responsible for, the existence, quality, safety or legality of the Transportation Services advertised. Users should select and satisfy themselves as to the most appropriate Booking for their needs and we do not provide any suggestion, advice, recommendation or guidance as to the appropriate Booking or Transportation Services requirements for a User.
The responsibility for compliance and enforcement of all obligations under the Contract is between the User and the Operator.
If a User chooses to pay for a Booking using the App, we will process those payments and payment will be passed directly to the relevant Operators on the User’s behalf in accordance with these Terms.

SECTION B: MAKING A BOOKING
This section explains the contractual process for making a Booking for Transportation Services and details of how you can cancel a Booking.
Booking a journey
You may request at any time a Booking for immediate travel or booking for a time or date in the future. Please see the provisions below in this Section B for step-by-step instructions on how to make a Booking.
We may make changes to the Lynk Services at any time but will make every effort to ensure that these do not substantially and adversely affect your use of those services.
Booking requirements
To make a Booking you must first login to your account using the App and must have the means of payment and sufficient funds to pay the final fare.
Making a Contract with Operators for the Transportation Services
Your Booking request is an offer to buy from the relevant Operator. When you are making a Booking, the following steps have to take place before a Contract is made between you and that Operator:
after selecting or inputting your pick-up and drop off locations, you will be presented with a fare estimate for your journey together with details of the Operator that will fulfil your Booking, including their contact telephone number. Before making your Booking request, you will be given the opportunity to review and, if necessary, to change your selected journey details.
you make your Booking request by pressing ‘Book Now’.
you will see an on-screen acknowledgement that your Booking request has been made.
the Operator accepts your order at the time you receive an email confirming your Booking (Confirmation Email). Accordingly, nothing that we or an Operator says or does will amount to any acceptance of your offer until you receive a Confirmation Email, at which point a Contract will be made between you and the Operator unless, prior to sending that email, we or the Operator notifies you that your Booking has not been accepted (see paragraph 8.1 below). We keep a record of your Booking history which you can view by logging-in to your account on the App. Your Booking and the provision of the Transportation Services will incorporate the terms and conditions of the applicable Operator allocated to fulfil your Booking. Please contact the individual Operator for details by using the contact telephone number and email address for that Operator in your Confirmation Email.
Refusal of your Booking request
Your Booking may be refused at the Operator’s sole discretion, including if the Operator has no cars available or if the User requesting the Booking has been blacklisted due to previous inappropriate behaviour.
Accessibility requirements
If you would like the vehicles you book to be accessible by wheelchair by default, please turn this feature on using the settings options within the App.
Unless agreed in advance with an Operator, child seats will not be provided for your journey. If you are travelling with any minors, you will be solely responsible for fitting and removing any child seat in a vehicle.
Substitute Operators
In the unlikely event the Operator allocated to your Booking is unable to fulfil your booking after you have submitted your Booking request, we may endeavor to find an alternative Operator to fulfil your Booking. We will inform you of the change of Operator using the contact information you have provided to us.
Fare estimates and payment
The fare estimates for your journey quoted on the App are in Euro.
The period during which you can make a Booking based on the fare estimate presented to you varies due to factors including the particular Operator allocated to your journey, the time of day, the date, your journey details and the availability of cars. Consequently, we cannot guarantee that any quoted fare estimate will be active for any period of time.
The fare estimate quoted is not a fixed price and your actual fare will be calculated using the meter rate of the applicable Operator together with any initial pickup charge. Fare estimates exclude any extras services such as waiting time, parking or unscheduled stops. If available, extra services may be requested directly from the Operator and, if agreed, will be subject to their terms and conditions and may be subject to the payment of additional fees.
Operators currently accept payment by cash or if paying electronically using the App by debit card and via the following credit/charge cards: Visa, MasterCard and American Express. When making a Booking, you confirm that the form of payment that you use to make payment to us is yours and that you have authority to make the Booking.
All charges for Bookings are payable after the completion of your journey. If you have chosen to pay electronically, payment for the charges, together with any auto-tip you have pre-selected (see Tips under paragraph 12) will be taken from your chosen payment method automatically after your journey has completed.
Secure Customer Authentication (SCA): If you chose to pay by card, under SCA banking rules your bank will preauthorise payment of the estimated cost of your fare. This preauthorised amount will be held secure (ring-fenced) by your bank until your journey is completed at which point the preauthorised amount will be released by your bank to pay for your fare, taking into account any adjustments up or down. You cannot remove your card as a payment method or change the payment method during this period and until your journey is complete or until you cancel your journey. If you choose to cancel your journey the preauthorised amount will be released by your bank between one hour and 7 days after the cancellation, depending on your bank. Some banks release your funds faster than others.
Tips
If you would like to tip the driver for your journey you may do so in cash at the end of your journey or by turning on the ‘auto-tip’ feature within the settings of the App and selecting the tip percentage (e.g. 10%).
If you turn on the auto-tip’ feature, until you turn the feature off, the payment taken using your electronic payment method at the end of every journey will include an additional amount for a tip that is equal to the percentage of the final fare that you selected at the time you turned that feature on.
Cancelling your Booking
If you would like to cancel your Booking, you can do so using the relevant option within the App or by contacting the applicable Operator by telephone directly.
You may cancel your Booking without charge at any time prior to dispatch of the vehicle by the applicable Operator.
If you wish to cancel your Booking after your vehicle has been dispatched a cancellation charge may apply. The cancellation charge will be based on the standard rates of the applicable Operator but will not exceed €10 euro five EURO (€5) except in relation to airport pickups where the cancellation charges may be more. Please check the terms and conditions of service for the applicable Operator before making your Booking.
If you have chosen to pay for the Transportation Services using an electronic payment method, payment of your cancellation charge will be taken automatically using that method and a receipt will be provided to you by email.
Contacting your driver
If you have any difficulty locating your driver after making a Booking or if your driver does not arrive at the pick-up location, please contact the relevant Operator directly using the contact details provided within the App. Please quote your Booking reference number for your journey included in your Confirmation Email or provide the journey time and your full name.
Refunds and disputes with Operators
Any refund requests should be made directly to the applicable Operator using the contact details provided in the App and/or relevant Confirmation Email. We are not responsible for managing or obtaining refunds on your behalf.
Should a dispute arise between a User and Operator they should use their best efforts to resolve that dispute between them and all complaints and queries with respect to a Booking should be directed to the other party involved. We have no obligation to mediate between you and an Operator or to enforce any Contract.

Lynk Delivery Person Terms and Conditions
SCOPE OF HIS SECTION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
There are two parties to these terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”):
Lynk
And
The independent delivery person [You, as the delivery person, are the person who has registered on the Lynk driver app and makes deliveries for Lynk’s customers]
There is no partnership between you and Lynk and neither party is providing service to the other. We, you and Lynk, are providing delivery service to Lynk’s customers.
As a Lynk app user you will comply with these Terms and Conditions.
By registering on the Lynk app and/or by accepting items of equipment belonging to Lynk you agree that you are entering into agreement with Lynk and are bound by these terms and conditions.
Any breach of the Terms and Conditions will result in termination of agreement.
You indemnify Lynk against all costs, claims or demands associated in any way with your actions, inactions or negligence and/or associated in any way with the agreement.
Both parties have had the opportunity to take legal advice prior to entering into this/the agreement.
PRODUCT
The “
Product
” is driver application, a customer application, a web application, a telephone system, a dispatch system and ancillary systems that allows the delivery person to connect with customers to arrange for the collection and delivery of parcels/goods by independent Lynk delivery people and the use of a base (where available) which can be used as a place for customers to contact their delivery drivers.
PHONE CALLS
Calls are recorded for quality, verification and training purposes in line with our Privacy Statement –
https://www.lynk.ie/legal/
USING LYNK
You must register with Lynk, providing Lynk with accurate and up to date information further to which you shall be entitled to use the Product in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
You are not an employee of Lynk and you are not engaged by Lynk but rather are an independent delivery person entering into an arrangement with Lynk whereby you will use the Product in order to connect you with customers in order to collect and/or deliver goods.
Customers seeking to connect with a delivery person will make a booking through the app, website, other electronic means or by phone and you will collect the parcel and electronically mark the job as completed on completion. You may nominate another person to carry out a booking on your behalf provided that person can show that they are legally entitled to drive the car being used for the delivery. For processing and tracking purposes you must inform Lynk of the arrangement.
When active on the app, you should update the status of your availability to be seen as an available delivery person.
You acknowledge that under these Terms and Conditions you are not permitted to display the branding of any other service.
Lynk is under no obligation to provide you with a minimum amount of booking request options. You are not required to accept any booking requests nor are you required to complete a minimum amount of bookings in any given month or year.
You are not required to be available during any particular hours of business nor are you required to be available for any minimum period of hours in a given month or year. You may choose to be available or unavailable at any time and for any period of time that suits you, within the bounds of the law.
Service hours will be 24/7/365. These service hours are subject to change at Lynk’s discretion without prior notice to you.
As a delivery person you may be required to deliver alcohol. The person receiving the alcohol must be over the legal age to consume alcohol and you must be satisfied that this is the case and you accept that it is your responsibility to do so. Therefore, you agree to ask for proof-of-age photographic identification (ID), such as a passport or driver’s licence, from the receiver of the goods. You agree to take a photograph of the ID alongside the order print-out with the order number and date of birth clearly visible in the photograph. If the receiver does not have appropriate ID but is obviously over the age to consume alcohol you agree to photograph the person alongside the order print-out in the manner described in this clause. You agree to electronically send the photograph to an e-destination nominated by Lynk. You accept that it is your responsibility to photograph the identification properly and verify the receiver’s age and you indemnify Lynk in this regard. If the receiver of the goods does not agree to have a photograph taken, as described in this clause, you agree that you will not pass over the goods and you will return them to the store at a cost paid for by the store.
PAYMENT AND CHARGES
The customer may pay for bookings by cash, card and/or on account.
You agree to pay weekly Freight, where “Freight” means the weekly money paid by you to Lynk. Freight is Lynk’s share of the delivery charge paid by Lynk’s customers or clients regarding the bookings dispatched to you. Freight may vary from driver to driver and/or from delivery to delivery.
Freight may be a variable periodic amount or a fixed periodic amount being an averaged percentage split of the delivery charges and then fixed for convenience and security. Freight may be a percentage of each delivery charge (sometimes called commission or percentage), a fixed value per delivery charge (sometimes called pay-per-job or PPJ or booking fee) or any combination of these amounts.
You will receive your portion of the price of a delivery and Lynk will receive its portion as set on the Lynk System and as appears on your statements. Lynk’s portion is subject to change with one week’s notice and at the discretion of Lynk.
You agree to settle your account with Lynk on a weekly basis and on time.
You agree to pay any Freight charges applied to your account or to completed bookings.

Lynk operates a licensed taxi dispatch business whereby it dispatches bookings that it receives from its clients and customers to its associated, independent Driver pool who are registered on the Lynk driver app.
Part of that business operation involves providing the Drivers with fleet packages.
Fleet packages often contain items that you need to carry out your taxi business. Items such as a complete taxi or one or more of the component parts of that taxi such as a Plate.
In return you share a portion of the taxi fares, paid by Lynk’s customers or clients, with Lynk. This share is called Freight.
Freight – the weekly money paid by you to Lynk. Freight is Lynk’s share of the taxi fares paid by Lynk’s customers or clients regarding the bookings dispatched to you. Freight may vary from driver to driver and/or from fare to fare. Freight may be a variable periodic amount or a fixed periodic amount being an averaged percentage split of the fares and then fixed for convenience and security for example, but not limited to the average of an 80-20 split. Freight may be a percentage of each fare (sometimes called commission or percentage), a fixed value per fare (sometimes called pay-per-job or PPJ or booking fee) or any combination of these amounts.
Standard Freight – is the freight payable when no discount is applied.
Special Freight – is the freight payable for the when discount is applied for example, on Plate and App packages. It is 20% less than Standard Freight and is applied when you complete a minimum of 25 Lynk bookings in a calendar week. The freight associated with the agreement is Special Freight, on the mutual understanding that you will complete at least 25 bookings per calendar week.

Freight may be a variable periodic amount or a fixed periodic amount being an averaged percentage split of the fares and then fixed for convenience and security for example, but not limited to the average of an 80-20 split.
