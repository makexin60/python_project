Section 4: Collection of personal data when renting a Vehicle or becoming a member
If you like to rent a bike, ebike, etc. (“Vehicle”) or becoming a member, you will need to provide personal data (e.g. name, email address, mobile number, payment method, credit card number etc.) in order to conclude the contract. In addition, we need this personal information in order to process your order. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) point (b) of the GDPR. We store these data as long as you are our customer with an active account. Your account is regarded inactive, if you have not made use of the account for 48 consecutive months, after which point in time the order data will be erased, if we are not obliged to retain the data as described below.
Under the provisions of the applicable commercial and tax laws, we are obliged to retain your order data for the legally prescribed period. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) point (c) of the GDPR. At the end of the statutory retention periods stipulated by the commercial and tax laws, we shall erase your order data.
We also collect and process the following data when you use a Vehicle:
Location and route of the Vehicle
Duration of the use of the Vehicle
Vehicles locks and unlocks
Occurred errors
We collect and process this data at various cities and periods, analyse the resulting data to drive our strategic and operations decisions such as where to place hubs or how many mechanics to employ to take care of the Vehicles. We also use the data to optimise our App.
Phone location data is only collected when your phone has location services turned on. Turning off location services will automatically opt-out of the collection of location data.
Phone location is collected for the following purposes:
Unlocking, locking the Vehicle and ending a rental requires location services to be turned on to ensure that a vehicle can be found and rented again. It also enables our technical staff to find bikes that need repairs.
If location services are turned on, they will also be used to determine accurate product prices on the local market where a user is present.
The legal basis for this type of data processing are Article 6 (1) point (f) and Article 6 (1), point (b) of the GDPR. The aforementioned purposes constitute our legitimate interests. We store this data for 48 months and then anonymise and aggregate the data.
Section 5: Advertising
We also collect and process your data to send you personalized advertising (this is referred to as profiling).

The legal basis for processing your data for personal advertising purposes is in accordance with GDPR article 6, (1) point (f), due to our legitimate interest.
You have the right to object to this processing of your personal data, and may exercise this right by submitting a request for objection by contacting us at support@donkeyrepublic.com, clicking on the unsubscribe link available in each email, or closing your account.
