The splix.io servers log very basic information about every device connecting to our site. These include your IP address, but may also include all data that is sent to and received from the server, such as your username, the block color and pattern you chose and the movements you make while in game.
None of this information is associated with an identified person when it is collected, unless the user voluntarily submits information to us that can be identified with a person.
Our site uses local storage to save user preferences, including but not limited to your username and your block color.
