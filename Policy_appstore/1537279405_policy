Privacy Policy
We like that you care about privacy — we do too.
Cryptocurrency Alerting
aims to be fully transparent about the data we collect, and what we do with it.
We always ask for as little information from you as possible.
We never require any personal information to use our service, not even your name.
We partner with Stripe for securely handling credit card transactions (we never see or handle your card number) and we fully support crypto payments from anywhere in the world.
We use Google Analytics and an error tracking service (Sentry) to collect basic usage data to help ensure that our product is working correctly. You can opt out of this by simply using
Brave
, a privacy-focused browser.
At any time, you may delete your account and wipe all related information from our servers. To do so, simply locate the corresponding button on your "My Account" screen.
If you choose to give us your phone number to receive SMS or Phone call alerts, please do not use one that is tied to any important accounts. But you probably shouldn’t have your phone tied to important accounts anyway (see:
sim jacking
).
Below is a standard privacy policy agreement that we've been advised to use. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to
get in touch
.
Our privacy policy applies to information we collect when you use or access our website, service, or just interact with us. We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Whenever we make changes to this privacy policy, the changes are effective immediately after we post the revised privacy policy (as indicated by revising the date at the bottom of our privacy policy). We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you access our services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

Sharing of Information
We may share personal information about you as follows:
With third party vendors and other service providers who need access to your information to carry out work on our behalf, such as sending alerts effectively;
If we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request;
To enforce applicable user agreements or policies, including our Terms of Service (https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/terms.html); and to protect us, our users or the public from harm or illegal activities;
In connection with any merger, sale of cryptocurrencyalerting.com assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company; and
If we notify you through our services (or in our privacy policy) that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.
We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.
Third Party Analytics
We may allow third parties to provide analytics services. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and third parties to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and other websites and better understand your online activity. Our privacy policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third party cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.

To opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please contact contact@cryptocurrencyalerting.com.
