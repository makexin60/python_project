SCAM Notice:
Notice:It  has  come  to  our  notice  that  unauthorized  individuals  or organizations  are  falsely  using  the ENOC/  EPPCO  names  in  an  attempt  to  fraudulently  recruit  on  behalf  of  ENOC  and  entities within ENOC Group of Companies ("ENOC").
Please  note  that  all  individuals  who  are  successful  in  gaining  an  offer  of  employment  from ENOC,  whether  directly  or  indirectly  are  always  required  to  go  through  a  formal  recruitment process. During our recruitment process, the candidate will, in general, meet in person with an ENOC  employee  or  representative  for  an  interview  before  any  formal offer  is  made.  All communications  will  always  originate  from  a  verifiable  ENOC  e-mail  address  and  not  from  any free  web  based  email  accounts.  As  an  example,  e-mail  communication  on  recruitment  from ENOC, if any, would be sent by ENOC officials using only e-mail domains of @enoc.com.
Moreover,  ENOC (nor any of the organizations that recruit  on our behalf)  never ask for money  transfers  or  payments  of  any  kind  from  candidates  at  any  point  in  the  recruitment  process. Therefore,  if  you  receive  any  communication  contrary  to  the  foregoing,  please  treat  such communication  as  fraudulent  and  you  should  consider  reporting  the  incident  to  your  local  law enforcement.
DISCLAIMER: ENOC shall not be responsible for the content of any information nor shall it be liable for any conclusion, loss or damage of any nature whatsoever suffered or may be suffered by any part or members of the public arising from or as a result of reliance on or usage of any information relating to recruitment in ENOC from portals, websites or e-mail domains which are not authorized by ENOC.
