DateStamper Privacy Policy
Last Updated January 29, 2023
This Privacy Policy document informs you of the policies regarding any collection, use, and disclosure of information received from users of the DateStamper application, DateStamper Photos extension, and the DateStamper website.
DateStamper App and Extension
DateStamper honors and respects your privacy and security. DateStamper does not identify or track you. Information about you is simply not collected.
DateStamper may access your photos only after permission is explicitly granted to the Photos library and this access can be revoked at any time. Alternatively, you may grant limited access only to the photos you select. Access to photos is required in order to apply date stamps to them. DateStamper does not transmit photos outside of the app as processing of photos is performed entirely on-device. DateStamper does not collect or otherwise store your photos nor any information about your photos. Photos and their metadata are stored in your Photos library.
DateStamper may access your location only after permission is explicitly granted and this access can be revoked at any time. Access to location is not required, but can be enabled if you would like to tag your location in photos you take in the app, or to see your current location on the map when editing a photo's location. DateStamper does not collect or otherwise store your location data. Location information is immediately discarded when the app no longer needs it to perform its function. If you stamp a photo with the name or address location option enabled, DateStamper will securely transmit the location where your photo was taken to Apple's server where it will be reverse geocoded to determine the place name or address at that location.
DateStamper Website
In order to utilize the Contact Me form available, some personally identifiable information is required to be sent via email, including your name and email address. This information is used only to provide support; it is never sold or made available elsewhere. I strive to protect this personal information, however, absolute security cannot be guaranteed, as any transmission of data over the internet cannot be 100% secure.
Changes to This Policy
Updates to this Privacy Policy will be made available on the website. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes.
By using the DateStamper app, or visiting the DateStamper website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
