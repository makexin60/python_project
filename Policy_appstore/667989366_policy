4 Transmission, storage and security of your personal data
Security over the internet
4.1
No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.
4.2
All information you provide to us is stored on our or other secure servers set up by trusted third-party service providers who have been verified to meet our company's management standards and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Export outside the EEA and UK
4.3
Your personal data may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the country in which you are located, whose data protection laws may be of a lower standard than those in your country. We will, in all circumstances, safeguard personal data as set out in this Privacy Policy.
4.4
Where we transfer personal data from inside the European Economic Area (the
EEA
) and/ or the United Kingdom (UK) to outside the EEA or UK, we may be required to take specific additional measures to safeguard the relevant personal data. Certain countries (including, where applicable, certain organisations self-certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (
DPF
) or the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF) outside:
(1)
the EEA, have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws; and
(2)
the UK, have an adequacy decision in force under United Kingdom adequacy regulations.
Therefore, no additional safeguards are required to export personal data to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals, we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, the UK Information Commissioner approved standard contractual clauses or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.
4.5
Please contact us through the
“General Data Protection Enquiry”
form below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data.
Storage limits
4.6
Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When personal data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymised information) or securely destroy the data.
