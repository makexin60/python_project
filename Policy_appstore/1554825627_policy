This may be Personal Data that you have previously provided to the relevant Licensing Authority or that they have obtained from another source. For example, you may have provided that personal data to the Licensing Authority when you applied for a Licence in the past.
Additionally, we may be instructed by a Licencing Authority to make a published register available.  In that event, a subset of your Personal Data may be included on such published register.  The type of register (public or restricted), the data to be displayed in it and the parties that may access it is determined by the Licensing Authority in accordance with its statutory powers.  Licences.ie provides the technical functionality to Licensing Authorities to display such published registers.  Licences.ie does not otherwise have control over the content of them.  Requests for removal from or amendment to such published registers should be directed to the relevant Licensing Authority.
In each of the circumstances above, we act as a data processor of such Personal Data on behalf of the relevant Licensing Authority who is the data controller.
In cases where we are acting on behalf of a different data controller (such as a Licencing Authority), we will act only on their instructions in relation to processing your Personal Data.  In these cases, it is that third party which is responsible to you for complying with your rights in relation to your Personal Data.  If you send any request to us to exercise your rights, we will send it on to the data controller as soon as possible.
Green Hub
We will share your data with our partners when you request us to.  Our partners will then become the controllers of that data and their privacy statements will apply.

However, some transfers may be to countries which do not have equivalent protections, and in that case An Post shall use reasonable efforts to implement contractual protections for your Personal Data.  While this will not always be possible where we are required to transfer your Personal Data in order to comply with and perform our agreement(s) with you or where we have a legal obligation to do so, any transfers will be done in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including through the implementation of appropriate or suitable safeguards in accordance with such applicable data protection laws.

Information about Profiling and Marketing
Profiling
Profiling means:
“any form of automated process to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements”.
Any proposed analysis of information which the An Post Group uses in relation to you, be that age, profession, socio-economic group etc., to determine what marketing should be targeted at you, will fall within this definition.
An Post may also profile your data when undertaking a risk assessment for fraud prevention and Anti Money Laundering (AML) purposes.
There are two lawful bases which allow a data controller to profile your personal data.  One is where you give your consent to this profiling and the other where it is in the legitimate interest of the data controller to do so.
Where An Post acts as a data controller and wish to use its legitimate interest as a lawful basis to profile your data we will always carry out a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) prior to using your data for profiling purposes.  This LIA will balance your rights against the rights of An Post and will always check that such profiling does not have a significant adverse effect on you.
Where An Post acts as a data processor and An Post wishes to profile your data then An Post will always ask for your consent prior to any profiling.  This will come in the form of a tick box and will be underneath the tick box where you agree to receiving direct marketing.
When you sign up to an An Post Account we will use and analyse your Personal Data, including transaction data on your accounts, in order ensure that the account is working correctly, that you are getting the most value from the features and benefits of the account and to make the marketing materials we send to you, more relevant to your interests and requirements and can be used as part of a more general market, statistical and product development analyses in relation to our business generally.  This profiling is carried out in our legitimate interest.
You can object to us analysing your Personal Data for profiling purposes by writing to us at
opt-out@anpost.ie
. If you do object to this analysis, the marketing information you receive will not be made more relevant to you.

Promotion of safety and customer service. For the purpose of monitoring and resolving traffic management issues

In general, data recorded on CCTV is retained for no longer than 31 days. It will be retained for longer periods where required in connection with criminal investigations, or where An Post requires the data in connection with legal proceedings or has a legal obligation to retain the data for a longer period.

Your personal data is being collected by the trustees (the “Trustees”) of the following schemes, collectively referred to as the “Schemes”.

What is the legal basis for processing the data?
The Trustees process your data to comply with their legal obligations under the Schemes’ governing documents, pension and trust law requirements, and for the purpose of the Trustees’ legitimate interest in promoting the proper and efficient administration and management of the Schemes in order to provide benefits for you or your dependents.

Strictly Necessary
Strictly necessary cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features and/or services and allow us to track our critical web business indicators. Any cookies used in this way are first party only in nature and are fully aggregated and anonymous. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, the website will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the website or certain services or features.
Performance
Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. Google Analytics is being used in first party mode and does not capture IP addresses or similar personal data. Performance Cookies are only used to improve how a website works.
Functional
Functional cookies allow this website to remember choices you make and any customisations you make to website pages during your visit and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, these cookies can be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. More information about such cookies can be found in the relevant third party website.

Social Media
These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the website for example to enable you view video content from YouTube. They are capable of tracking your browser across other websites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see our video content.
