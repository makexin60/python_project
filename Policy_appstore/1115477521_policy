FlyLady and Company, Inc., Privacy Statement
This Privacy Policy applies to ALL users, including but not limited to, users of the EU/EEA member countries (as per the GDPR mandate effective May 25, 2018).
Statement of Intent:
At FlyLady and Company, Inc., nothing is more important than earning and keeping users’ confidence, trust and respect. This philosophy applies to the website, email lists, social media accounts and any other interaction users may have with FlyLady.net and FlyLady and Company, Inc. Accordingly, we strictly adhere to our Privacy Policy to ensure that the personal information is not misused in any way.
Personal Information:
Personal information such as name, mailing address, physical address, email address, telephone number and time zone is collected when users voluntarily register for membership services at FlyLady.net and/or when customers purchase products via the internet shopping cart of the FlyShop at FlyLady.net (please note that we do NOT store any credit card information; it is stored by Authorize.net who expunges the information after 90 days). This information is used internally ONLY (stored on secure servers) and will NOT be sold, rented, given or disclosed to anyone outside of FlyLady and Company, Inc. unless such information is subpoenaed, or if FlyLady and Company, Inc. believes that said membership and/or purchases have been used to commit unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of others.
Aggregate Data and IP Addresses:
FlyLady and Company, Inc. (FlyLady.net) records IP addresses for the purposes of system administration (internal use only; stored on secure servers) and to provide aggregate data to create reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. When using a FlyLady.net account or signing up for our email lists, your IP address is noted, but not associated with this aggregate data. This data may be temporarily and manually associated with you to assist with technical problems you may be having with our service or in the event of a security problem with your account and would be deleted immediately upon resolution. The notation of your IP address with your FlyLady.net account is automatically deleted upon the expiration date of the cookie assigned to your device or upon logging out of that device.
Children Under Age 18:
No children under the age of 18 should submit or post to FlyLady.net without their parent’s approval.
Constant Contact:
Since we currently use the Constant Contact’s email system, please refer to the
Constant Contact Privacy Statement
for their Privacy Policy.
Email Lists are Opt-In:
Subscriptions to our email lists are opt-in and subscribers can opt-out (unsubscribe) at any time. Every email sent to our subscribers contains instructions on how to unsubscribe.
Cookies:
We may collect information about users that is not personally identifiable. This information might include the type of web browser you are using or the domain name of the website from which you linked to our website. This type of information is similar to demographic information in section 3 and will be used in the same manner. Accordingly, FlyLady and Company, Inc. (FlyLady.net) uses cookies to keep our website secure. If you are a member of FlyLady.net, you will be given a cookie as a “visitor’s pass.” This lets you freely navigate our website without having to present your credentials all the time. Depending on how you have configured your account, this cookie may stay for over a year, or last until you close your browser. You may have software on your computer that erases cookies, blocks them or informs you before a cookie is stored. If that software interferes with the cookie operation, you may find yourself presenting your member credentials more than once. Refer to the documentation for your software for more information about how to control cookies. FlyLady.net does not control any cookies you may receive from our advertisers and sponsors, and these are not subject to FlyLady and Company, Inc.’s Privacy Policy.
Security of Information:
FlyLady and Company, Inc. (FlyLady.net) cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. All transmissions are done at your own risk. Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall FlyLady and Company, Inc. (FlyLady.net) be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages that result from the use of the information or materials on FlyLady.net or FlyLady’s email mentoring lists.
Linked Websites:
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by FlyLady and Company, Inc. (FlyLady.net). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of linked websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy policies of linked websites.
Record of Stored Personal Data:
You may request a copy of the record of YOUR personal data that we’ve stored on your behalf. Email your request to Orders@FlyLady.net or you may mail your request to FlyLady and Company, Inc., 132 Commerce Street, Brevard, NC 28712. If, at any time, you want your stored personal data deleted, you may request that, as well, by emailing or mailing us as instructed previously. Please note, however, that deleting the information will mean that we cannot search previous orders, or the like, and, if you are using our App, deleting this information will include deleting your email information, which, in turn, will cause you to lose access to the App and you will not be able to reclaim it. No refunds will be given in this event.
FlyLady and Company, Inc. (FlyLady.net) reserves the right to update this policy at any time and without notice. Please check back for updates.
FlyLady and Company, Inc. (FLYLADY.NET) welcomes your questions, comments and/or concerns related to this Privacy Policy, or any aspect of our business. Feel free to email us at FlyLady@FlyLady.net, or “snail mail” us at FlyLady and Company, Inc., 132 Commerce Street, Brevard, NC 28712.

CONSTANT CONTACT PRIVACY NOTICE
Last Updated: August 29, 2023
ABOUT US
Constant Contact, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Constant Contact”, “us” or “we”) is a leading provider of email and digital marketing services and lead generation and customer relationship management services to businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations. We refer to the products and services that are ordered by our customers (“Customers”) and provided by or on behalf of us to our Customers pursuant to the Terms of Service
here
, as the “Services.”
Our Services help our Customers provide timely and relevant marketing and communications on a cross-media basis. Our Customers can upload contact lists and use our platform to reach their own customers and others through email and other channels. Personal information and other data submitted by or on behalf of a Customer in connection with the Services, including contact lists (which may include email addresses and other information for a Customer’s contacts) and content (including the content of a Customer’s campaigns) (collectively, “Customer Data”), belongs to and is controlled by our Customers. Constant Contact acts as a service provider or processor to its Customers, including when we offer to Customers various Services through which our Customers (or their affiliates): (i) create their own applications running on our platforms; (ii) sell or offer their own products and services; (iii) send electronic communications to their contacts through our Services; or (iv) otherwise collect, use, share or process personal information via our Services.
When acting in this capacity, we process Customer Data on behalf of our Customer, and we have no direct relationship with the end-users who use our Customers’ services or products or visit our Customers’ websites. Constant Contact does not process Customer Data except as provided in our Terms of Service with our Customers, available
here
.
The Customer Data that we handle on behalf of our Customers is not collected on our websites, but rather through our Customers’ independent use of our platform.  For example, our Customers may use our platform to encourage their contacts to sign up for their email lists. Emails sent from the Constant Contact platform include single pixel gifs, also known as web beacons, which contain unique identifiers that enable us and Customers to recognize when their contacts have opened an email or clicked certain links. These technologies record each contact’s email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click for an email campaign. We use this data at our Customers’ direction to create reports for our Customers about how an email campaign performed and what actions their contacts took and to analyze, customize and enhance our Customers’ communications and strategies.  For more information about how we process Customer Data, please review our
Customer Contact Data Notice
.
We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our Customers, including with respect to the personal information they collect or upload to our Services.  If you are an end user of one of our Customers whose personal information we process and you are seeking to exercise your data rights, you should contact our Customer directly.
