We process certain Personal Data as
    necessary in connection with our legitimate interest in personalizing our
    Services. For example, aspects of the Services may change so they are more
    relevant to you. We may personalize based on Preference Data and your current
    interactions with the Service using Personal Data we hold about you. We may
    also personalize based on Profiles, where permitted by law, e.g. by displaying
    your name and other appearance or display preferences, to display content that
    you have interacted with in the past, or to display content that we think may
    be of interest to you based on your interactions with our Digital Services and
    other content.
Aggregated

We process Personal Data in order to
    identify trends, including to create aggregated and anonymized data about
    buying and spending habits, use of our Services, and other similar information

    requirements or prevent illegal activity. We may also process data to protect
    the vital interests of individuals, or on certain public interest grounds, each

    extraordinary circumstances.
Commercial Purposes
We and certain third parties process
    Personal Data to further our commercial or economic interests (“
Commercial
    Purposes
,”) depending on the context of collection and your
Rights & Choices
.

– We may require your consent, or we may not engage in processing of Personal Data for Commercial Purposes in some jurisdictions. See the “
REGIONAL SUPPLEMENTS
” section below for more information.
Profiles
Entertainment is personal, and we are
    always working to help you find the best concerts, festivals, sports, and other
    events for you to enjoy. In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and
    better recommend products and services that are personalized to our customers,
    we may create a “
Profile
” by linking together and analyzing Personal
    Data processed in the following contexts:
Account Registration
Purchases and Transactions
RFID Products/Digital Tickets
Our Digital Services
Contest and promotions
Contact Us; Support
Posts & Social Media
Feedback & Surveys
We may augment Profiles with Personal Data that
    we receive from Event Partners, affiliates or third parties, e.g. information
    about Services you have used or purchased previously, events and venues you
    visited, or locations at those events/venues, or demographic data and data from
    your publicly-available social media profiles.
In some cases we process Preference Data
    that reveals Race or Ethnic Origin as part of our Profiles. We typically
    process this information in relation to marketing for certain events (e.g.
    cultural or heritage events.) Depending on applicable laws, we may not collect
    this information, and we may require your consent before collecting it. We will
    limit the use and disclosure of your Race or Ethnic Origin according to
    applicable law. See the “
Regional Supplements
” section below for more
    information about your rights in Sensitive Data.
We use Profiles for our legitimate
    interests in market research and statistical analysis in connection with the
    improvement of our Services. For example, we may analyze the Personal Data of
    customers who have purchased tickets for a future event, and then compare them
    with other customers in our database. If we identify other customers in our
    database who have similar Personal Data to the original purchasers, we may
    direct marketing about that event to the similar customers. We may conduct the
    profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically.
Profiles involve processing that is
    automated, in whole or in part.
Personalized
    Marketing Communications
We may personalize
Marketing
    Communications
based on your
Profile
. If consent to Consumer Profiling or
    Targeted Advertising is required by law, we will seek your consent.

    certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in
    advertising targeted to your interests based on Personal Data that we or those
    third parties obtain or infer from your activities across non-affiliated websites,
    applications, or services in order to predict your preferences or interests (“
Targeted
    Advertising
” or “
Sharing
”). This form of advertising includes
    various parties and service providers, including third party data controllers,
    engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising.
    These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of
    Personal Data for Targeted Advertising purposes may create or leverage
    information derived from
Personalization
,
Profiles
,
    and
Marketing
    Communications
. In some cases, these parties may also develop and
    assess aspects of a Profile about you to determine whether you are a type of
    person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you
    see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with
    demographic and other Preference Data, and may track whether you view, interact
    with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you purchased advertised
    goods or services.
We generally use Targeted Advertising for
    the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, and
    to send Marketing Communications, including by creating custom marketing
    audiences on third-party websites or social media platforms.
Data Sales
We may engage in “sales” or “sharing” of
    data as defined by applicable law. For example, we may “sell” certain Personal
    Data when we engage in marketing campaigns with or on behalf of sponsors,
    conduct Targeted Advertising or data “sharing,” or we may sell or grant access
    to Personal Data to our marketing partners, Event Partners, and other
    advertisers in relation to Targeted Advertising, joint promotions, and other
    marketing initiatives. See the
US Regional Supplement
section for a list of
    categories of Personal Data sold or “shared.”

    or other similar feature, use an event hashtag or similar link, or otherwise

    these parties may also receive data for our

    the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to the
    life, health or safety of any individual or to public health or safety) or in

PROCESSING PURPOSES
Business Purposes
We and our Service Providers process Personal Data we hold for numerous business purposes, depending on the context of collection, your
Rights & Choices
, and our legitimate interests. We and our Service Providers generally process Personal Data for the following “Business Purposes.”
Service Delivery
We process Personal Data as necessary to
    provide our Services and the products and services you purchase or request. For
    example, we process Personal Data to authenticate users and their rights to
    access the Services, events, or venues, as otherwise necessary to fulfill our
    contractual obligations to you, provide you with the information, features, and
    services you request, and create relevant documentation.
Internal Processing and Service Improvement
We may use any Personal Data we process
    through our Services as necessary in connection with our legitimate interests
    in improving the design of our Service, understanding how our Services are used
    or function, for customer service purposes, for internal research, technical or
    feature development, to track use of our Service, QA and debugging, audits, and
    similar purposes.
Security and Incident Detection
We may process Personal Data in connection
    with our legitimate interest in ensuring that our Services are secure, identify
    and prevent crime, prevent fraud, and verify or authenticate users/individuals,
    and ensure the safety of our guests. Similarly, we process Personal Data on our
    Services as necessary to detect security incidents, protect against, and

    analyze network traffic, device patterns, and characteristics, maintain and
    analyze logs and process similar Personal Data in connection with our
    information security activities.
Contextual Advertising
We may display contextual advertising on
    our Services. In which case, we may customize such advertisement using data
    processed based on your current interaction with the Service (e.g. time,
    general location). We may also document and audit ad impressions and related
    data relating to the delivery and display of contextual advertisements.
Personalization
We process certain Personal Data as
    necessary in connection with our legitimate interest in personalizing our
    Services. For example, aspects of the Services may change so they are more
    relevant to you. We may personalize based on Preference Data and your current
    interactions with the Service using Personal Data we hold about you. We may
    also personalize based on Profiles, where permitted by law, e.g. by displaying
    your name and other appearance or display preferences, to display content that
    you have interacted with in the past, or to display content that we think may
    be of interest to you based on your interactions with our Digital Services and
    other content.
Aggregated
Data
We process Personal Data in order to
    identify trends, including to create aggregated and anonymized data about
    buying and spending habits, use of our Services, and other similar information
    (“
Aggregated Data
”). Aggregated Data that does not contain Personal Data
    is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, such as where you exercise your
    rights under data protection law, for the establishment and defense of legal
    claims, where we must comply with requests from government or law enforcement
    officials, and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement
    requirements or prevent illegal activity. We may also process data to protect
    the vital interests of individuals, or on certain public interest grounds, each
    to the extent required or permitted under applicable law. Please see the
How We Share Personal Data
section for more information about how we disclose Personal Data in
    extraordinary circumstances.
Commercial Purposes
We and certain third parties process
    Personal Data to further our commercial or economic interests (“
Commercial
    Purposes
,”) depending on the context of collection and your
Rights & Choices
.

– We may require your consent, or we may not engage in processing of Personal Data for Commercial Purposes in some jurisdictions. See the “
REGIONAL SUPPLEMENTS

Profiles
Entertainment is personal, and we are
    always working to help you find the best concerts, festivals, sports, and other
    events for you to enjoy. In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and
    better recommend products and services that are personalized to our customers,
    we may create a “
Profile
” by linking together and analyzing Personal
    Data processed in the following contexts:
Account Registration
Purchases and Transactions
RFID Products/Digital Tickets
Our Digital Services
Contest and promotions
Contact Us; Support
Posts & Social Media
Feedback & Surveys
We may augment Profiles with Personal Data that
    we receive from Event Partners, affiliates or third parties, e.g. information
    about Services you have used or purchased previously, events and venues you
    visited, or locations at those events/venues, or demographic data and data from
    your publicly-available social media profiles.
In some cases we process Preference Data
    that reveals Race or Ethnic Origin as part of our Profiles. We typically
    process this information in relation to marketing for certain events (e.g.
    cultural or heritage events.) Depending on applicable laws, we may not collect
    this information, and we may require your consent before collecting it. We will
    limit the use and disclosure of your Race or Ethnic Origin according to
    applicable law. See the “
Regional Supplements
” section below for more
    information about your rights in Sensitive Data.
We use Profiles for our legitimate
    interests in market research and statistical analysis in connection with the
    improvement of our Services. For example, we may analyze the Personal Data of
    customers who have purchased tickets for a future event, and then compare them
    with other customers in our database. If we identify other customers in our
    database who have similar Personal Data to the original purchasers, we may
    direct marketing about that event to the similar customers. We may conduct the
    profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically.
Profiles involve processing that is
    automated, in whole or in part.
Personalized
    Marketing Communications
We may personalize
Marketing
    Communications
based on your
Profile
. If consent to Consumer Profiling or
    Targeted Advertising is required by law, we will seek your consent.
Targeted
    Advertising
In some jurisdictions, AXS affiliates and
    certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in
    advertising targeted to your interests based on Personal Data that we or those
    third parties obtain or infer from your activities across non-affiliated websites,
    applications, or services in order to predict your preferences or interests (“
Targeted
    Advertising
” or “
Sharing
”). This form of advertising includes
    various parties and service providers, including third party data controllers,
    engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising.
    These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of
    Personal Data for Targeted Advertising purposes may create or leverage
    information derived from
Personalization
,
Profiles
,
    and
Marketing
    Communications
. In some cases, these parties may also develop and
    assess aspects of a Profile about you to determine whether you are a type of
    person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you
    see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with
    demographic and other Preference Data, and may track whether you view, interact
    with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you purchased advertised
    goods or services.
We generally use Targeted Advertising for
    the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, and
    to send Marketing Communications, including by creating custom marketing
    audiences on third-party websites or social media platforms.
Data Sales
We may engage in “sales” or “sharing” of
    data as defined by applicable law. For example, we may “sell” certain Personal
    Data when we engage in marketing campaigns with or on behalf of sponsors,
    conduct Targeted Advertising or data “sharing,” or we may sell or grant access
    to Personal Data to our marketing partners, Event Partners, and other
    advertisers in relation to Targeted Advertising, joint promotions, and other
    marketing initiatives. See the

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Make a privacy complaint
We're keen to work with New Zealanders to get their privacy queries and complaints sorted quickly and fairly. Before you complain to us, you need to
complain directly to the business or organisation that you feel has breached your privacy.
If you haven’t been able to work out your privacy issue with them,
then you can complain to us
. We aim to ensure that you're treated fairly, whatever your background or circumstances. We work in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1993.

Privacy Amendment Bill: what you need to know
The Privacy Amendment Bill is making its way through Parliament, and we know organisations are starting to think about how this will impact them. We’ve put together key information on the Bill, which we’ll update as it progresses.

Agencies: report a data breach
If you're an organisation and have a privacy breach that is likely to cause anyone serious harm, you are legally required to notify us and any affected persons as soon as you can.
As a guide, our expectation is that a breach notification should be made to our Office no later than 72 hours after agencies are aware of a notifiable privacy breach.
