Our Privacy Policy
​
(The world's
smallest
privacy policy.)
​
None of our apps store any of your data.  Period.
​
We physically can’t.  We have nowhere to store it.  We don’t even have a server database to store it.  So even if our own mothers asked us nicely to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show them.
​
And, of course, we'll never sell your data, because we don't have it.
​
With all our apps, what happens on your computer stays on your computer.
