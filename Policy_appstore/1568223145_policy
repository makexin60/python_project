Image Collection
The Hivemapper Network is designed to protect people's privacy while collecting imagery to build and update a global map. Your personal information and location data are not the product being monetized. The Hivemapper Network is building a private mapping network that offers contributors anonymity.
What Is Collected?
The Hivemapper Dashcam is an open-source product that collects information in a privacy-centric manner. The primary pieces of data it collects includes:
Imagery
Street-level imagery in 2K and 4K resolution
GNSS Data
Accurately positions map imagery and features
IMU Data
Inertial Measurement Unit sensor that measures acceleration

Privacy by Design
Randomly Generated Usernames + Location Data + Imagery collected
Each Contributor’s username is randomly generated to ensure anonymity, and contributors’ location data and imagery collected is never publicly tied to a username or Hivemapper profile.
Privacy Blurring
Automatically blurs faces, license plates, cars, and bodies from the imagery on the edge - dashcam mapping device - prior to uploading imagery.
Edge Processing
The Hivemapper Dashcam automatically privacy blurs images and detects objects (e.g., speed limit signs) on the edge.
Privacy Zones
Personal and network level privacy zones where all data collection is automatically paused.
No Identifiable Info Collected from Contributors
When contributors collect imagery, faces, license plates, cars, and bodies are automatically blurred on their Hivemapper Dashcams, to ensure the imagery we receive does not include personal information of road users (bystanders). Unblurred imagery is never shared with the Hivemapper App and Hivemapper has no access to unblurred imagery.
No Personal Info Collected from Road Users (bystanders)
Each Contributor’s username is randomly generated to ensure anonymity, and contributors’ location data and imagery collected is never publicly tied to a username or Hivemapper profile.
Transparency
In certain countries we require you to display a placard on your vehicle indicating that you are collecting for a map.
See here
for the countries and placards.
