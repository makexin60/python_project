The privacy policy of Authenticator App is a boring document, but we strongly recommend you to read it thoroughly.
Effective date: Jun 5, 2023
Privacy Policy
This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.
Brief Overview of Our Commitment to Privacy
We believe that the less information we know about you, the better. After all, it is impossible to lose, misuse, or abuse information we don’t have.
Personal Data
We don’t collect and don’t have access to your personal data that you save in Authenticator. Everything you do is saved into your iCloud account in encrypted form and is synced across your devices using the same iCloud account. When you use our software, we may record some usage analytics, subscription validation, and crash logs. The sole purpose of this data is to help us make better decisions on where to focus our efforts and improve our software. You provide some data directly, such as when you contact us for support. Such data is limited to your email address only.
Subscription Validation
In-App purchases.
Usage Analytics
The app usage analytics collected is minimal but essential to help us run our business. Currently, we collect:
Application starts/ends.
Device locale.
Device type, CPU architecture, and version of the operating system.
Crash Logs
Crash logs are, by default, automatically sent on the next app start. These logs contain anonymized data about the crash that can help us identify the cause and potentially provide a fix in a future update. These logs do not contain any data or metadata about the content you create with our software. Here’s what’s collected:
Anonymized bundle identifier and short bundle version string of your app.
Device type, CPU architecture, and version of the operating system.
Timestamp when the crash happened.
A generated UUID to prevent duplicate crash reports.
If an exception was thrown, the plain-text class name and message value of the exception.
Low-level crash data like instruction pointer, method or function names, signal data, pointer registers, and information about the loaded binary images.
The application log file.
We use Crashlytics to collect and manage this data.
Any Questions?
If you have any questions at all, about your data or any other query, kindly contact us at congthi.feedback@gmail.com. We are happy to answer everything.
Your complete satisfaction is our number one priority. Please tell us if anything falls short of your expectations so we can actually do something about it, regardless of these rules. Nothing is set in stone, and we are open to making adjustments.
