Our relationship with you
Customers and applicants for a Luno account
To check which Luno entity you are a customer of, refer to our
Terms of Use page
. The Luno entity that offers and provides our services is the company that is responsible for protecting personal data. Depending on where you are located, the company with that responsibility will typically be known as the "data controller" or the "responsible party.”
Business accounts
Please note if you are using a Luno business account, our role and the personal data we process will depend on whether you are a) responsible for the account or b) an employee or representative of a business and you have been invited to use its business account. If you are the account owner, the Luno entity providing the services is the data controller. If you are an authorised user, the account owner is the ‘main’ data controller of your personal data except in some cases where Luno will be the data controller, for example we need to verify your identity for our Know-Your-Business checks or respond to valid requests from law enforcement authorities.
Non-customers
Luno may collect personal data about you even if you are not a customer of ours. For example, you may have visited our website or used our app without using our services or have interacted financially with a Luno customer, for example you are the counterparty to a transaction. Luno will comply with local law when it collects and processes personal data about you in these circumstances.
The personal data that we process
The personal data that we process will depend on our relationship with you: the information we collect about you as our customer will differ from the information we obtain about you if you are still being verified as a customer or are just visiting our website. You can find out more about the different account levels at Luno in our
Help Centre
.
The personal data that you provide us
We obtain personal data from you in various ways, including when you sign-up with us (for example, by filling in forms and submitting documents to open an account online or through the app), when you use your Luno account, when you contact us for any reason by email, chat or social media chat, when we contact you to confirm information or instructions (for example when we call you on your mobile number), when you respond to surveys or give us feedback and when you participate in a competition or engage with us on social media or participate in campaigns and promotions.

Biometric data
We need to verify your identity before you may open an account with Luno, update your security-related information (such as your email address, password, etc.) or recover your account or password. To verify your identity, we will ask you to take a photo or video selfie which we’ll compare with the photo on your chosen identity document (e.g., your passport or national ID book or card) to see if they match. The information collected from your selfie includes biometric data, which we process to comply with strict know your customer and anti-money laundering screening requirements. We do this because it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations under relevant regional and local anti-money laundering and anti-financial crime laws and regulations. Where required by local law, we will also ask for your consent to collect and use biometric data.

Automated Decisions
Customer onboarding
Our onboarding procedure is partially automated and we may make decisions regarding your eligibility as a customer by automated means. This means that we use technology to decide whether to accept you or refuse to onboard you as a customer based on your age, location, residency and the results of anti-money-laundering and sanctions checks. If we do not have enough information for the technology to make a decision on your eligibility, we will ask you to re-upload your documentation or a member of our Customer Success team will be in touch with you. If the automated procedure determines that you are underage, do not meet our acceptance criteria or are found to be violating our Terms of Use, your application will be automatically denied.
Vulnerable customers
Vulnerable customers are customers that due to their personal circumstances, are particularly susceptible to financial detriment, such as scams and other fraudulent activity. We try to protect vulnerable customers by placing an automatic system lock on their account when a cryptocurrency send is requested. This entails that a customer will not be able to send any outgoing crypto transactions until such time as they have contacted us and we have completed a satisfactory review of the purpose of the account, origin of funds and purpose of the transaction.
Suspected fraud and suspicious transactions
If we suspect fraud or receive a fraud report regarding your Luno account, an automatic lock will be applied to your account while we investigate. Our Customer Success team will be in touch with you regarding the outcome of our investigation and whether access to your account will be reinstated.
Marketing
We may send you information about our products, services, news and promotions, or otherwise communicate with you, by email, push or in-app notifications, text message or other means for marketing purposes. When we communicate with you for marketing purposes we will do so only in accordance with applicable laws relating to consent and opt-outs.
You may opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time by changing your communication preferences in your account communication settings in our app or on our website. You may also opt out of receiving email marketing communications at any time by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” option included in every email marketing communication sent to you. Please note that unsubscribing from marketing content will not stop you from receiving important communications in relation to the security or operation of your account or the Luno product (for example when we need to inform you of upcoming maintenance, changes to our
Terms of Use
, in the event of a security incident, etc.).

Third parties and service providers
When data processing is carried out on our behalf, we conclude a separate agreement with service providers, called a data processing agreement, which ensures that they process personal data on our instructions and implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to keep personal data secure and to protect your rights.
Sometimes third parties may use personal data to comply with their own legal obligations, for example payments processors and banks. When they do this they do so as the data controller and are responsible for compliance with data protection law.
How long we keep personal data for
We will typically retain personal data for the duration of your relationship with us, and afterwards for such period as may be necessary for our legitimate business purposes (including compliance with our legal obligations, preventing fraud, resolving disputes and enforcing agreements), to protect the integrity of our services, to protect the safety and security of our customers and to comply with the law.
Click here to see how we decide how long to keep personal data for
We follow our internal data retention policy to determine appropriate retention periods for personal data. A retention period depends on a combination of factors such as when the personal data was collected and our reasons for collecting and using it, the amount and sensitivity of the personal data, whether it is needed to provide our services to you or to comply with our legal obligations, whether the personal data forms part of a master record subject to specific retention periods (for example under tax, regulatory, company administration, employment and/or accounting requirements and guidelines) and if we believe there is a prospect of a dispute or litigation.
You may ask us to delete personal data in certain circumstances. For more information please see the section
“Your rights”
below.
International transfers of personal data
Luno is a global organisation and, in the course of providing our products and services to you, personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located. Those countries may have data protection laws that provide a level of protection which is lower than that available in your country. For example, personal data will be processed by Luno companies in various jurisdictions and by our third parties who operate around the world. We will only transfer personal data where permitted by local law and with appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses.
Keeping personal data secure
Luno places great importance on ensuring the security of our systems and personal data. We maintain an ISO 27001 certification, which requires us to implement and regularly review appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures to keep personal data safe. Our employees are trained to handle personal data securely and with the utmost respect, failing which they may be subject to disciplinary action. For more information on Luno’s security processes please visit the
security page
on our website.
Privacy when using digital assets and blockchains
Your use of cryptocurrency may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to re-identification of transacting individuals and the revelation of personal data, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.
As blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which are not controlled or operated by Luno, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data on such networks.
Your rights
Depending on the applicable law and the reason for the processing, you may be entitled to exercise the following rights:
Ask us to give you access to personal data.
This right entitles you to receive confirmation that we process personal data relating to you and you may sometimes also be able to request a copy of the personal data.
Ask to have personal data erased.
This right entitles you to ask us to delete or remove personal data concerning you. Please note that we may not be able to comply with your request either in whole or in part because of certain legal reasons. To the extent that we can’t comply with your request we will get in touch with you to give you the reasons for our decision.
Object to our processing of personal data.
Where we process personal data based on our legitimate interests but you believe there are circumstances that mean we shouldn’t, you may submit an objection; however there may be times when we can demonstrate legitimate grounds that override your objection. If we believe we have legitimate grounds to override your objection we will be in touch with you to give you the reasons for our decision.
