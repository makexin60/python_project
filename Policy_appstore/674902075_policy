Effective date January 20, 2021. Last reviewed October 3, 2023
McKinsey & Company Inc., and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“McKinsey”, “us,” or “we”) are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal data. We define personal data broadly as information that directly identifies an individual or that makes an individual identifiable when combined with other information.
This Recruiting Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) describes how we handle and protect your personal data in connection with McKinsey’s recruiting processes and programs. In case of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and applicable law, applicable law will govern.
This Privacy Notice only applies to the personal data of job applicants, potential candidates for employment or partnership, and those who participate in our recruiting programs and events.
By submitting your personal data to us, you acknowledge that:
You have read and understood this Privacy Notice and agree to the use of your personal data as set out herein.
Your personal data may be transferred and processed worldwide, including in countries that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country, for the purposes and in the manner specified in this Privacy Notice.
You are not required to provide any requested information to us, but your failure to do so may result in our not being able to continue your candidacy for the job for which you have applied.
All of your representations are true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, and you have not knowingly omitted any related information of an adverse nature. Providing any inaccurate information may make you ineligible for employment.
This Privacy Notice does not form part of any contract of employment offered to candidates hired by McKinsey.
Personal data we collect
The types of personal data that we request from you and the ways that we process it are determined by a combination of the requirements of the country in which the role you apply for is located and the country in which you reside. Should you apply to more than one location or should the role to which you apply be available in more than one country, the types of personal data we request from you and the ways that we process it are determined by the requirements of all the countries in which the position is located in conjunction with the requirements of the country in which you reside.
We usually collect personal data directly from you when you apply for a role with us through our online application process, such as your name, address, contact information, work and educational history, achievements, identity documents,  test results, any information that may be required due to legal requirements (e.g. residence or work permits)  and other categories of data that you voluntarily decide to share with us. We also collect data about you which is created by our recruiting personnel in the course of their interactions with you during the recruiting process or through your participation in our interactive assessment tools. Where permitted by law, we may collect photographs or videos, including those obtained during our recruiting events or as part of the recruiting process itself. If you receive an offer from us, we may then conduct a background check and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also collect data related to criminal offences and proceedings. We also collect similar personal data about you from third parties, such as professional recruiting firms, your references, prior employers, McKinsey employees with whom you have interviewed or who recommended your candidacy, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, employment background check providers. We may also collect personal data about you online to the extent that you have chosen to make this information publicly available on professional social media websites. For example, we may find your profile on LinkedIn and contact you about suitable roles.
Sensitive personal data is a subset of personal data that includes ethnicity, health, trade union membership, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, and other categories as prescribed by law. We may collect sensitive personal data about a candidate to the extent permitted or required to do so by applicable laws (e.g., U.S. equal opportunity laws) and to support our efforts to create an inclusive and diverse work environment. Under limited circumstances and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also collect sensitive personal information relating to health and medical characteristics, , to address our public health and workplace safety obligations , to provide reasonable accommodations to facilitate the interview process (in case of disabilities) and to protect the Firm and its employees, clients, and third parties.
Use of your personal data
We collect and use your personal data for legitimate human resources and business management reasons, including:
identifying and evaluating candidates for potential employment, as well as for future roles that may become available;
maintaining records in relation to recruiting and hiring;
ensuring compliance with legal requirements, including those relating to public health and workplace safety;
fostering our diversity and inclusion programs and practices;
if you receive an offer from us, conducting background checks, including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, criminal history checks;
protecting our legal rights to the extent authorized or permitted by law; and
protecting the workplace and communicating with medical professionals, law enforcement, or other public authorities in the event of an emergency or public health event, such as when the health or safety of you or one or more individuals may be endangered.
We may also use your personal data for McKinsey analytics purposes, including in aggregated/pseudonymized form, to improve our recruitment and hiring process and augment our ability to attract successful candidates.
Legal basis for processing your personal data
Our processing of your personal data for the purposes mentioned above is based in one or several of the following legal grounds:
in part, on our legitimate business interests in evaluating your application to manage our relationship with you, to ensure that we recruit appropriate employees, and to evaluate and maintain the efficacy of our recruiting process more generally; and in operating our business and protecting the Firm and its employees, clients, and third parties. When we rely on this legal ground, McKinsey will only process your personal data after assessing the adequacy, proportionality, and legitimacy of the data processing activity
in part, on our performing contractual and precontractual measures relating to our potential employment relationship with you;
in part, on our complying with applicable law with regard to personal data necessary to satisfy our legal and regulatory obligations, including with regard to public health and workplace safety;
in part, on your consent, if we offer you the opportunity to participate in our optional recruiting programs or if we collect sensitive personal data for legally permitted purposes other than compliance with our legal obligations regarding public health and workplace safety.
Background screening
If you receive an offer from us, we may conduct a background check on you or instruct a third party to do so on our behalf. Background screening will only be done where permitted by the law applicable to the location where the position is located and to the extent necessary and proportionate to the role that you are being offered. A background check will only involve criminal background data to the extent permitted by law. Our legal basis for background screening is our need to perform precontractual measures related to establishing our employment relationship. If a background screening is required, you may be contacted by a third-party background screening service provider to request authorization for the release of your information, and at that time you will be provided with further information about the process and what personal data it might involve.
Data recipients and international data transfers
Your personal data may be accessed by recruiters and interviewers working in the country(ies) where the position(s) for which you are applying is(are) based, as well as by recruiters and interviewers working in different countries within the McKinsey global organization. Individuals performing administrative functions and IT personnel within McKinsey may also have access on a need to know basis to your personal data to the extent necessary perform their jobs. In some countries, you may have fewer rights under local law than you do in your country of residence, but we have put in place legal mechanisms designed to ensure adequate data protection for your personal data when it is processed by McKinsey subsidiaries and affiliates within the McKinsey global organization and by McKinsey’s service providers, including the transfer of your personal data to countries other than the one in which you reside.
We use third-party service providers to provide a recruiting software system. We also share your personal data with other third-party service providers that may assist us in identifying and recruiting talent, administering and evaluating pre-employment screening and testing, and improving our recruiting practices.
Except to the extent necessary to accomplish the McKinsey uses and purposes described in this Privacy Notice, we do not disclose your personal data to third parties. We also prohibit our service providers from using your personal data for non-McKinsey purposes. We do not otherwise share or sell your personal data to third parties.
We maintain processes designed to help ensure that any processing of personal data by third-party service providers is consistent with this Privacy Notice and protects the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of your personal data in compliance with applicable law. Where required by law, we put in place additional legal mechanisms designed to help ensure adequate data protection for your personal data when transferred to another country.
In addition, we may disclose or transfer your personal data in the event of a re-organization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, or other transfer or disposition of all or any portion of our business.
Automated sorting of applications
In certain jurisdictions, we may use data analytics and algorithms to help us to review the large quantities of candidates and application data that we receive. These algorithms help us prioritize the application review process and sort candidates on the basis of professional characteristics that suggest strengths and capabilities necessary to perform the relevant role.
The automated results are considered in combination with other information about the candidate and each candidate's assessment is based on human judgment. We evaluate each individual candidate on their own merits.
Certain roles may require specific prerequisites or skills (for example, fluency in a certain language, particular professional qualifications or certifications, or number of years in a similar role). Applications that do not meet those requirements may be automatically rejected.
Data retention
If you accept an offer of employment with us, any relevant personal data collected during your pre-employment period will become part of your personnel records and will be retained in accordance with specific country requirements and with the privacy notice applicable to McKinsey employees, which will be provided during the on-boarding process.
If we do not employ you, and unless you object by following the process described in the Section “Your Rights” below, we may nevertheless continue to retain and use your personal data for a period of time (which may vary depending on the country) for system administration purposes, to consider you for potential future roles, and to perform research. Thereafter, we retain a minimal amount of your personal data to record your recruiting activity with us.
To the extent that we have collected personal data, including sensitive personal data, for the specific purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations regarding public health or workplace safety, we will retain that data for the duration of those legal obligations. Thereafter, we retain a minimal amount of your personal data to establish our compliance with those obligations.
We may want to remain in contact with you and consider you for future employment opportunities. In such an event, we will seek your consent to include you in one of our recruiting programs that provides you ways to further learn about and stay in touch McKinsey, either prior to or after you formally apply for a job opportunity. Participation in these recruiting programs is entirely optional.
If you join a recruiting retention program, we retain your personal data for a period of time specific to that program, but if you wish to withdraw at any time, please contact us at
keep-in-touch@mckinsey.com
. For candidates in Germany, please contact us at

This Privacy Notice was last reviewed on February 14, 2024.
This Privacy Notice explains how McKinsey & Company, Inc. United States and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “
McKinsey
”, “
us
” or “
we
”) process personal data that we obtain from your access to and use of our proprietary data- and analytics-driven tools, surveys and solutions, including those described at
https://www.mckinsey.com/solutions
(the “
Solutions
”), to perform benchmarking, research, development, and related activities, and as authorized under applicable data privacy laws.
If you are accessing these Solutions in connection with services that McKinsey is providing to the organization with whom you are associated (“
Your Organization
”), McKinsey has executed a licensing or consultancy agreement for the provision of professional services (the “
Solution Agreement
”), and those contract terms and Your Organization’s privacy practices control personal data processed on behalf of Your Organization. This Privacy Notice supplements any notice that you may receive from Your Organization, and it applies only to McKinsey’s use of your personal data for its own purposes as described in this Privacy Notice. We may update this Solutions Privacy Notice at any time, and we will make an updated copy of this Notice available on McKinsey website.
For California residents,
please note that we do not share or sell your personal data as those terms are defined in California Civil Code § 1798.140.
1. How do we collect your personal data when we are acting as a processor?
We may collect and process personal data about you for the purpose of providing services to, and on behalf of, Your Organization (our client), either from Your Organization, from a third party identified by Your Organization, or directly from you, including via surveys, questionnaires or other information-gathering tools supplied by Your Organization or by us. If we do so, McKinsey acts as a data processor on behalf of Your Organization. This personal data may include, without limitation, business contact information such as your name, professional email address, or employee ID, job role, department, or reporting line, (“
Business Contact Information
”); demographic and other professional information such as work history and education; finance-related information such as compensation and benefits, performance ratings; progress and proficiency data such as assessment scores, course completion rates and performance metrics, course evaluations, survey and discussion responses; technical information related to systems and devices, such as IP address information, log-in information, account information, usage metrics, browser telemetry (e.g., type, version), time stamps; and other personal data similar to the foregoing. McKinsey shall not be responsible or liable for the use of such information by Your Organization (e.g., making certain of your personal data visible to other members of Your Organization or third parties (such as other participants in your learning session)), and such use shall be subject to Your Organization’s policies (including privacy policies) applicable to you.
2. How and what categories of personal data do we collect when we act as a data controller, for what purpose(s) and who has access to your personal data?
McKinsey may act as a controller to the extent that we process your personal data in connection with your use of the Solutions or your participation in McKinsey’s surveys or questionnaires, including log-in and Business Contact Information to allow you to set up a user account to use and access the Solutions; personal data that we collect for security purposes (for example, device information, IP address, and log data) to provide technical support and maintenance support; and to improve our services and Solutions, such as your usage data while using the Solutions.
As a data controller, we use this personal data for our own business purposes, including (subject to our obligations to Your Organization) for providing our services to our clients, benchmarking, impact tracking (e.g., counting in and across Solutions the number of total users who have taken a course or used a Solution), research and reporting, product or business development purposes, and further developing, improving, securing and optimizing Solutions usage, performance, features, and functionality. In certain situations, we may collect sensitive personal data (e.g. biometric data, health related information, sexual orientation, data about ethnicity, race, religion or philosophical beliefs, political opinion, trade union membership) directly from you, for instance when you respond to a survey conducted by McKinsey and provide us with demographic or other personal data, for research, data analysis or statistical purposes. We use sensitive personal data only with your consent unless another lawful basis exists (for example, public health requirements). We may combine personal data that we receive directly from you with personal data that we collect through your use of McKinsey’s website or other client services (including your use of other Solutions) or that we receive from third parties, including Your Organization.   All collection and use of personal data and sensitive personal data will be based on this privacy notice and with the purposes and access described in this notice, unless otherwise stated to you in a supplementary notice at the time of the collection.

3. Data collection from children
McKinsey’s Solutions are not designed for use by anyone under the age of 16 and McKinsey does not knowingly provide services to anyone under the age of 16. To the extent that any of our Solutions may involve collecting or maintaining personal data from or about individuals under the age of 16, we would do so only with the required legal consent from the parent, guardian, or individual and in accordance with applicable law.
4. What do we NOT do when we collect and process your personal data?
California residents:
We do not share or sell your personal data as those terms are defined in California Civil Code § 1798.140.
When we receive deidentified data or we transform personal data that we have collected into deidentified data, we make the following commitments:
McKinsey will maintain deidentified data in deidentified form.
Except to the extent necessary to confirm that personal data has been transformed into deidentified data, McKinsey will not attempt to identify or reidentify specific individuals within a deidentified data set or otherwise use deidentified data to attempt to associate specific individuals with their individual characteristics and will not permit any entity or individual acting on McKinsey’s behalf to do so.
To the extent, if any, that McKinsey provides access to or otherwise discloses a deidentified data set to a non-McKinsey recipient, for example, a service provider or a client, McKinsey does not permit such recipient to attempt, or permit others to attempt, to identify or reidentify specific individuals within the deidentified data set or otherwise use deidentified data to attempt to associate specific individuals with their individual characteristics.
McKinsey Solutions do not collect your personal data or track your activities over time across third party websites or other online services (e.g., your general web browsing history). Accordingly, we do not alter our data collection and use practices in response to “do not track” signals transmitted from web browsers.
5. Who has access to your personal data? Data recipients and international data transfers
The personal data will only be shared, where permitted by applicable law. We may, for example, share your personal data with our affiliates or third-party service providers, such as IT infrastructure and technology providers, or in the event of the acquisition of the relevant McKinsey affiliate by a third-party entity, or where required by law, with governmental or public authorities. Since you are using our Solutions on behalf of Your Organization, we may share your personal data with Your Organization, as agreed between Your Organization and us as in the Solution Agreement.
Since McKinsey is a global organization, affiliates, and service providers to which we transfer your personal data collected via the Solutions may be located in countries which may have different data protection laws than those in your country of residence. McKinsey will implement safeguards to protect your personal data across McKinsey’s global operations. Where required by law, we have put in place legal mechanisms designed to ensure adequate data protection of your personal data that is processed by McKinsey affiliates and service providers, including Standard Contractual Clauses, and such other data transfer mechanisms as available by applicable law.
6. Security
McKinsey protects and safeguards your personal data globally, in accordance with applicable law, our privacy and data security policies, and this Privacy Notice. We use generally accepted standards of technical and operational security to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction, in consideration of the risks associated with the personal data and its processing, and we require the same level of protection and safeguarding from our subsidiaries and affiliates, our service providers, and third parties. Only authorized personnel of McKinsey and of our service providers are permitted to access personal data, and these employees and service providers are required to treat this information as confidential.  Despite these precautions however, McKinsey cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to your personal data.
7. How long do we keep your personal data?
McKinsey keeps your personal data only as long as necessary for the business purpose(s) for which it was collected to meet our legal or contractual obligations (including those with Your Organization) and in compliance with McKinsey’s data retention policy. McKinsey will retain the data for as long as it is needed to perform legal, regulatory, or post-contractual obligations, including McKinsey’s legal, regulatory, and documented professional archival obligations, or any disputes or litigation procedure, and will delete the personal data in accordance with McKinsey’s retention schedule. We will securely delete your personal data promptly after the purposes described above cease to apply in accordance with the prevailing market practice for such destruction.
