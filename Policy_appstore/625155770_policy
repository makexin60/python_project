Cookies and Other Similar Technologies
Cloud Software Group uses cookies, web beacons (including pixels and tags), and similar technologies on our Online Channels which may read or write information on your device in order to collect certain information about you by automated means. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
We use these automated technologies to collect information about your device or equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner includes IP addresses and other identifiers associated with your devices including Apple Advertising Identifier or Android Advertising ID, types of devices connected to our Offerings, device characteristics (such as operating system), language preferences, referring/exit pages, navigation paths, access times, email open rates, browser preferences and characteristics, installed plugins, local time zones, local storage preferences, clickstream data, and other information about your online activities.
We use on our Online Channels both first-party cookies (served directly by our website domain when you visit our Online Channels) and third-party cookies (served by a third-party website when you visit our Online Channels and certain third-party websites with whom we have partnered). Some of these cookies are session cookies (which are automatically deleted when you close your browser) and others are persistent cookies (which remain on your computer or other Internet-connected device for a period of time after you end your browsing session, unless you delete them).
The cookies we use on our Online Channels include: strictly necessary cookies, functional cookies, analytics cookies, and targeting/advertising cookies, as described below.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
We use strictly necessary cookies on our Online Channels that are necessary for us to provide you with our products and services. These include cookies used to securely authenticate you to our website and identify you after you have logged in and user-centric security cookies used to increase the security of the products and services we provide to you (such as to detect authentication abuses). Given the necessary functionality of these cookies, they typically do not require consent.
Functional Cookies
These cookies allow us to analyze your use of the Online Channels to evaluate and improve our performance. They may also be used to provide a better customer experience on the Online Channels. For example, remembering your log-in details, saving what is in your shopping cart, or providing us information about how our site is used.
Analytics Cookies
We use analytics cookies to collect information on how users navigate and use our Online Channels, such as how the users traverse our Online Channels, the pages they view, how long they stay on a page and whether the page is displayed correctly or whether errors occur. Such cookies help us to improve the performance of our Online Channels and make the Online Channels more user-friendly. These cookies are provided by third-party analytics providers, including Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit
Google Analytics
. To learn more about these analytics services and how to opt out, please view the Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing analytics cookies for.
Advertising Cookies
Advertising cookies are used to control and manage online advertisements. These cookies may collect information on whether a user has reacted to an advertisement and visited another website. Such cookies help us offer you content and provide targeted information that is more relevant to your interests. They also help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements and communications. In the EU, we deploy analytics and advertising cookies on our websites only when users have opted-in as required by applicable law.
Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Online Channels. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.
Additional information about our cookie practices and how to manage your cookie preferences is available in the Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing cookie preferences for. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before using cookies or similar tools.
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins on our Online Channels (such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook) also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Cloud Software Group is not responsible for these providers’ information practices.
Interest-Based Advertising
When you use our Online Channels, both we and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners and social media platforms) collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites (such as on websites that serve our ads). We may use such information to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served. You may see certain ads on other websites because we engage third-party ad buying networks. Through such buying networks, we can target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.
The information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Cloud Software Group advertisements, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in these ad networks. This process helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn how to opt out of this ad network interest-based advertising, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer at the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing cookie preferences for. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before using your information for interest-based advertising.
Our Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in provides details about how to exercise your choices (such as changing your cookie preferences).

if sharing your data is necessary to provide a product, service, or information you have requested;
as part of a joint sales promotion or to pass sales leads to our business partners;
to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, or other information we think you would like to hear from our business partners;

We share your personal information with the following entities:

with our vendors and service providers we have engaged to perform services on our behalf (such as payment processing, order fulfillment, customer support, customer relations management, and data analytics). These service providers are contractually required to safeguard the information provided to them and are restricted from using or disclosing such information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements;
with approved Cloud Software Group Partners, to offer and provide our products and services to you;
with our joint marketing and sales partners and other business partners who help us with our business operations or other aspects of our business and for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement; and
with third-party marketers (who may combine your personal information with their own records, and records available from other sources), for their own direct marketing purposes, and the direct marketing purposes of other third-party marketers.
We also may disclose personal information about you for the following legal and public policy reasons:
if we are required or permitted to do so by applicable law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena),
to law enforcement authorities or other government officials to comply with a legitimate legal request,
when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss to Cloud Software Group, its users or the public as required or permitted by law,
to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights, and
in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud, illegal activity, security or technical issues.
In addition, we reserve the right to transfer to relevant third parties information we have about you in the event of a potential or actual sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution, or liquidation) or other business transaction.
We also may share the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection and obtain your consent to the extent required by applicable law.
International Data Transfers
We transfer the personal information we collect through the Channels to, and store such data in, other countries in which Cloud Software Group and its service providers operate, including the United States, which may have different data protection laws than the country in which the information was provided. If we do so, we will transfer the personal information only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. To the extent required by applicable law, when we transfer your personal information to recipients in other countries, we will take measures to protect that information including, as appropriate, by executing data transfer agreements based on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses pursuant to article 46 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or by putting in place other appropriate data transfer mechanism(s).
Your Privacy Rights and Choices
To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may have privacy rights to access, correct, update, amend, delete, restrict the processing of your personal information, or object to automated decision-making based on your personal information.
When Cloud Software Group is acting as a “data controller” under applicable law, you may exercise such rights by completing a
Privacy Request form
or by contacting us using the information under the
How To Contact Us
section of this Privacy Statement, or, where applicable, by accessing your Cloud Software Group account. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information. To the extent permitted by applicable law, a charge may apply before we provide you with a copy of any of your personal information that we maintain. Depending on your location, you may have the right to file a complaint with a government regulator if you are not satisfied with our response.
When Cloud Software group is acting as a “data processor” and you wish to exercise your privacy rights of access and request corrections, suppression, or deletion, we will direct you to the data controller under the applicable data protection laws. Alternatively, to exercise any rights relating to personal information processed on behalf of our customers in connection with the use of our products and services, end users may directly contact the relevant customer, not Cloud Software Group. If you are a customer account administrator or customer account owner and require assistance with this process, such as if you want to make a request with respect to your own user data, you may contact us as described below.
Communication Preferences
We also offer choices in connection with the personal information we use to communicate with you, such as via email or telephone. To update your email and telephone communication preferences, limit the communications you receive from us, or submit a related request, please contact us as specified in the
How to Contact Us
section of this Privacy Statement. You can also unsubscribe from our email marketing by following the “Unsubscribe” link in our marketing emails.  Please note that unsubscribing from  marketing communications does not affect your receipt of operational communications that are important to your interaction with us or our services, such as communications about the status of your subscription, service changes, support communications, security updates, event registration updates or account management communications.
Interest-Based Advertising Choices
We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ("Principles") of the
Digital Advertising Alliance
in the U.S., the
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
, and the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
in the EU. If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit
Ad Choices
,
Ad Choices Canada
or
Your Online Choices
to find a convenient place to indicate your preferences, including the option to make one "universal" opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities.
These websites also provide detailed information about interest-based advertising and tips for managing your privacy online and in applications. Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on the Online Channels; rather, opting out means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on your interests. When you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements through the links above, cookies and other technologies on the Online Channels may still collect information about your use of the Online Channels, including for analytics, fraud prevention, and any other purpose permitted under the Self- Regulatory Principles.
Global Privacy Control (GPC)
Cloud Software Group recognizes Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signals where legally required. GPC is a browser setting that a user can set in order to send a signal to websites visited regarding the user’s cookie preferences. If your browser or browser extension has GPC enabled, we will recognize that signal and opt you out of non-essential cookies. For more information about GPC and how to implement GPC opt-out preference signals, please visit
globalprivacycontrol.org
.
Other Online Preferences
When you use our Online Channels, both we and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners, and social media platforms) may collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites. Certain web browsers allow you to instruct your browser to send Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to websites you visit, informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked. Our Online Channels are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from web browsers. However, you can manage your cookie preferences in connection with the personal information we collect about you by clicking on the Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing cookie preferences for.
Where provided by law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward. This will not affect the lawfulness of our use of your information based on your consent before its withdrawal. You may also have a right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority or other data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.
Some of the rights described above may be subject to limitations under applicable law.
How We Protect Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Personal Information.
How Long We Retain Personal Information
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we typically retain personal information we obtain about you for as long as it is needed (1) for the purposes for which we obtained it, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement, which generally means that we will keep your personal information for the duration of our relationship or as long as you keep your account open with us; (2) only for as long as we have a legitimate business need; and/or (3) for complying with legal requirements, taking into account applicable statute of limitation periods and complying with applicable laws, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. As described in the “Your Privacy Rights and Choices” section above, to the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may request that we delete your information or restrict the processing of such information by contacting us as indicated below.
Children’s Personal Information
The Online Channels are designed for a general audience and are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Online Channels. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete the information from our records. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 may have provided us with personal information, please contact us as specified in the
How To Contact Us
section of this Privacy Statement.
