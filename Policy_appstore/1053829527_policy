The protection of your personal data in the collection, processing and use during your visit to our homepage is a very serious concern. All personal information, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, account number, etc., and any information that may be attributed to you will be referred to as personal information. This includes the IP address that is automatically transmitted when you visit a website. This is technically mandatory.
We want you to know when we collect information and how we use it. We have taken technical and organizational measures to ensure that the rules on data protection are observed by us as well as by possible external service providers. In particular, we also take into account the Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) of the European Union (EU) to be implemented as of 25.05.2018.
Below you will find information about which data is collected during your visit to the homepage and how it is used.
If you want to assert your rights (see below), please contact us as the person responsible for the data processing on this website - the contact details can be found in the imprint.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding data protection, please contact our external data protection officer (DSB) at datenschutz@rauch.de. Please include our company name in the subject line so that the external DSB can assign this more easily.

Personal data may only be "processed" if there is a valid legal basis for this. The processing is bound to a specific purpose. We process personal data that we can collect via this website on the basis of the following legal bases:
Balance of interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO
When tools are used that aim to make our website more customer-friendly, efficient and secure, this can be done in the context of a weighing of interests, as this does not involve profiling user behavior and only briefly erases the IP address of the visitor is stored. This applies, for example, to Google Analytics.

Contractual relationship according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO

Legal requirements according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO
Insofar as we are subject to legal requirements which we must use to maintain your personal data, this is done within the scope of this legal basis.
Consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO
In rare cases it may be possible for us to use your personal information for a purpose other than intended. If this should occur and there is no other legal basis, we need your voluntary - at any time for the future - revocable consent, which we will then ask separately.

The storage serves internal system-related purposes, essentially to ensure the availability of our website, i.a. in accordance with ยง 100 TKG (disruption and misuse of telecommunications systems).
