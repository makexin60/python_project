2.	What personal information do we collect?
We collect the information that we need to run our business and give you the products and services that you ask for.
We only collect your personal information when we reasonably need it to run our business or comply with the law.
For example:
When you register for an account on our websites such as rode.com, soundfield.com, aphex.com and rodex.com (our “Websites”) (for example, to register your warranty or ask for your product to be serviced), we will collect your name and email address.
When you sign up for our newsletter, we will collect your email address.
When you sign up for a competition, we will collect your name, email address and the information that you provide.
When you complete one of our surveys, we will collect your survey responses.

When you apply to work with us, we will collect your name, email address, street address, phone number, information about your qualifications, work history, and background.
When you are employed by us, we will collect information that we need to manage our professional relationship, such as your name, personal contact details, qualifications, work history, information about your work and performance, payment information, and health information relevant to your work or required for workplace safety.
What if you don't want to give us your personal information?
We give people the option of not identifying themselves or using a pseudonym, where it is lawful and practical.
However, in some cases, if you don't give us your personal information, we may not be able to give you the service you want or respond to your request. For example, you must identify yourself to register for an account on our Websites, register for a warranty or request a service.
