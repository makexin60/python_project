We also may collect other types of information in the following ways when you use our online Services:
TRACKING TECHNOLOGY.
We and our service providers may use a variety of tracking technologies that collect usage information whenever you interact with our Services. We may combine certain automatically-collected information with other information we obtain about you, which may include data we obtain from external parties. We or external parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different online services when you use the Services. We may use tracking technologies and personal information that we have collected to enable our Services to function, for analytics and research to improve our Services and product offerings, to determine your location, for security, for marketing and online behavioral advertising, and for our other business purposes. Please see below for more information about some of the tracking technologies that we use.
INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY.
We automatically collect information from your browser when you use our online Services. This information may or can include your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.
COOKIES.
Cookies enhance our ability to serve you. Basically, they're pieces of text that a website stores on your computer—an identification code of sorts. This cookie can be accessed by the website when you revisit it.
We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies terminate shortly after you terminate your internet session. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted. Both types of cookies help provide an enhanced user experience since they recall your use of the Internet and our services, shopping preferences, shopping cart information, and your password.
We understand that not everyone wants to permit the use of cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies and how to disable cookies, but we recommend that you leave cookies turned on so that you can take full advantage of the shopping features we offer.
You may also review "HOW GOOGLE USES INFORMATION FROM SITES OR APPS THAT USE OUR SERVICES", (located at
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
).
We may allow third parties, including Affiliate companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our online Services. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our online Services do not provide any other personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer or device, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (
www.networkadvertising.org
).
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.
We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our online Services and enable us to customize our online Services and advertisements. We also may include web beacons and other similar technologies in promotional or other e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer visitors to our online Services to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming, or other activities.
Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive or device, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in e-mail) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages, and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our online Services from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
MOBILE SERVICES:
We may also collect information from your mobile device if you have downloaded any Affiliate mobile application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used may include, but are not limited to your geographic location, how you use the Affiliate application(s), and information about the type of device you use. To opt out of sharing this information, such as location, please review the terms and conditions before you download the application, review the settings on your mobile device, or you may choose at any time to uninstall the Affiliate application(s) from your mobile device.
Personal information we collect from third parties:

This can include updated address and shipping instructions information; credit information; information from advertisers; information from Facebook, Twitter and other similar platforms; information that is collected automatically through your use of our services; information from entities that provide information that supplements personal information we already have. The categories of third-party sources may include advertising networks, internet service providers, data analytics providers, government entities, operating systems and platforms, social networks, and data brokers.

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic, and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
We want you to feel confident using our online Services to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure e-mail. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at
www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm

USER-SUBMITTED CONTENT (BLOGS, BULLETIN BOARDS, REVIEWS, PROFILES, CHAT ROOMS, ETC.)
We may provide areas on our online Services where you can post information about yourself and others, create a profile, and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of products, establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your e-mail address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what others may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you will not be able to edit or delete such information.

FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
We may from time-to-time offer “Incentives” such as discounts on goods, discounts on shipping, prizes for participating in contests, and other similar incentives. In connection with offering Incentives, we may collect a name, email address, phone/text number, or other personal data; as further described in in the specific Incentive. To the extent that we collect personal data of a California consumer participating in connection with offering an Incentive, then the value of the personal data provided in connection with the Incentive is generally calculated as the value of the Incentive less our expenses in operating the Incentive program and other costs associated with our business activities related to the Incentive.
AUTHORIZED AGENTS.
A California consumer participating in an Incentive may opt-in to the Incentive by following the method of participation used for the Incentive. California consumers also have the right to withdraw from an Incentive at any time through the methods described in the terms and conditions of the Incentive program. Additionally, if an Incentive is related to receiving marketing emails or marketing text messages, a participating California consumer can withdraw from the Incentive by unsubscribing from the relevant communications, using the methods described in our Privacy Statement.
