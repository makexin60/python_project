Privacy Policy Highlights
Last updated: March 14, 2025. You can see past versions of this policy
here
in our privacy center.
We believe you should always know what data we collect from you, how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower users to make the best decisions about the information that they share with us. In fact, we made a
short video
for students and children that highlights the most important details in our Privacy Policy that they should know about. We offer a
Student Data Privacy Addendum
, an agreement we enter into with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to
Student Data
that we collect or receive.
You should read this policy in
full
, but here are a few key points:
Personal Information We Collect
: Please see
this page
where we detail the
personal information
we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose. You can also find more details
below
.
We also have an
Online Tracking Technologies Policy
.
How We Use the Information We Collect
: We use the
personal information
we collect from students (or about students from teachers and parents) to provide and improve (as allowed by law) the Service, for
educational purposes
, security, and safety purposes, or as allowed by law. We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Service. See
here
for more information on our use of information collected from students and children using the Service not connected to a school or classroom (“Outside School Child User”), including for educational and other learning activities at home through certain
premium features
that may be purchased, (**“**Premium Features”). For additional information regarding our use of information collected from teachers, parents,
School Leaders
, and
Admins
, see
here
.
Data Retention
:  Retention and deletion of
Student Data
and education records is at the direction of the school.  We enter into
Student Data Protection Addendums
with schools or districts that further describe our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to Student Data that we collect or receive. Additionally, we retain student
personal information
only for as long as necessary for fulfilling
educational purposes
and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information. We protect students with our industry-leading Student Data Protection Policy: we automatically delete (or
de-identify
and aggregate) their
Feedback Points
awarded in school after a year (and delete associated feedback comments after a year), and we delete
Students’ Accounts
if they’re
inactive
for more than twelve months. Some content within a student account utilized in school or for
educational purposes
connected to a school or classroom (“Student Account”) will be kept after deletion of the account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of “education records” under the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
or
“Student Data”
under state student privacy laws or equivalent laws in international jurisdictions) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school. This can include content uploaded by a student, teacher, school leader, or parent.
We store non-student user
personal information
, including content uploaded by Outside School Child Users, for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Service to you and others. For non-student users (as well as Outside School Child Users), personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is
deleted
or until we no longer need the information to provide the Service, whichever occurs first.  Additionally, some information is deleted or
de-identified
automatically after a set period of time.  For additional information on our retention periods, see
here
.
What Children’s Information is Shown Publicly?
No Student’s Account, or
Outside School Child User’s account
(“Outside School Child Account”), profile, or
Portfolio
is made available or visible to the general public through ClassDojo. For a list of what logged in student users and Outside School Child User’s information can be viewed by other logged-in ClassDojo users, please see our
FAQ
.
We Never Sell Personal Information
: We will never
sell
or rent your
personal information
or non-personal information. We will only disclose personal information as set forth in the Privacy Policy, such as with a limited set of
third-party service providers
necessary to provide or develop our Services (such as database hosting) or as required by law, and we will be transparent about who these service providers are.
We will contractually require that these service providers process personal information in accordance with our instructions and consistent with this Privacy Policy. We ensure that these service providers employ reasonable and comprehensive data protection and security protocols. See
here
for more details.
We make clear commitments, consistent with our obligations under the
Student Privacy Pledge
, regarding how we handle
Student Data
in the event of a change to our organization (such as a merger) where personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred or acquired. Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Privacy Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). Please see
here
for more details.
We never use student or children’s information for behaviorally targeted or third-party advertising
: Information collected from students and Outside School Child Users (including
personal information
and information collected automatically from areas designed for children to access) is never used or disclosed for
third-party advertising
. We also do not place any third-party advertisements in student or Outside School Child User logged-in areas of the Service. Additionally, personal information collected from students and Outside School Child Users is
never
used for
behaviorally-targeted advertising
to students or Outside School Child Users by us or any third-party. We may present
contextually relevant recommendations
(which means not using student or Outside School Child User
personal information
) for educational content for either our own products (e.g., Premium Features) or third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to a student (e.g., our co-created content with
Yale University on Mindfulness
, and Heart of a Champion series) or an Outside School Child User.
You own your data
: We don’t own any content or information you provide or we receive - you (students, Outside School Child Users, parents, and/or schools) will own your content and information.
Security and Privacy by Design and Default
: We use security industry best practices to protect
personal information
, including using encryption and other security safeguards to protect personal information. We design products with security and privacy in mind from day one. See
here
for more information as well as our
Security Overview
and
Privacy Center
.
Transparency and Choice
: We will be transparent about our practices so that you can make meaningful choices about how your
personal information
is used. If we make a material change, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on our Service or this website page and/or we will notify you by email (if you have provided an email address to us). See
here
for more information.
Right to Access, Correction, and Deletion of Data
: We support access to, correction, and deletion of children’s
personal information
by the student or their parent or legal guardian, either by 1) assisting the school in meeting its requirements for access, correction, and deletion or by responding to requests we receive from schools, or 2) directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians when the information is collected from an
Outside School Child User
, and ClassDojo obtains the
consent
directly from the parent or legal guardian. Where we are directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians, the school would not be
acting as the agent
of the parent - such as when the parent is using our Premium Features or uses ClassDojo not connected to a school.
Teachers, parents, School Leaders, Admins, and other users can contact us
here
once you are signed in to your account to access, correct, or update their personal information, or they can use the features in their account settings to do so. See
here
for more information on all user’s rights, including about any additional rights you may have depending on the jurisdiction you reside in.

.
What is ClassDojo?
School Use
ClassDojo is a communication and classroom management platform that brings schools, families and kids together. Teachers encourage and engage students in class and keep parents and other teachers in the loop. Teachers and authorized members of the school staff (“
Admins
”) use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “
Feedback Points
”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. Teachers can also post assignments using the activities feature for students to complete on ClassDojo
(“Activities”)
, including in the student’s individual
Student Portfolio
. Teachers can
privately message parents
or send group messages with text, pictures, videos, and stickers. They can also add posts to
Class Stories
,and
School Stories.
Teachers may also use our artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology tools (“
AI Classroom Tools”
) to save time and create more personalized comments. In addition, ClassDojo may provide certain AI features to assist teachers, School Leaders and Admins with certain non-classroom related use tasks (e.g. uploading rostering lists) (“AI Productivity Tools”). These users may choose to provide “inputs” that may contain text or photos/videos (e.g. a photo of a classlist of students) in connection with the use of these AI Productivity Tools. Teachers can also choose to offer the ability for students to visit a virtual world with their ClassDojo monster with their
Student Account
where they can engage in various activities (e.g. explore, build, and play certain games) and interact with other children (including their classmates of the same grade level) inside of the classroom (
“Class Islands”
).
Parents get to be a part of their child’s classroom experiences, and can receive messages from their child’s teachers or comment on Class Stories and School Stories.  Parents can only view their own children’s Feedback Points (if elected to be shown by their child’s teacher) and Portfolios, not those of any other students. They may also
set up their child’s account
on ClassDojo for use in school and at home.  Parents may optionally purchase
Premium Features
for additional ways to stay engaged with their school community and celebrate their child’s growth.  Note, however, that the Premium Features also have features that are not connected to a school covered in the “Out of School Use” section.
Students can have their own
Student Account
to view feedback given by teachers,
Admins
, and parents, and perform additional tasks, such as
posting to their Portfolio
,
responding to assigned Activities
(“Student Activity Responses”), commenting on Class Story or Portfolio posts (teacher and student comments collectively “Portfolio Comments”),
customizing their ClassDojo avatar
, and playing on their
Class Island
. In order to have a Student Account created, children will need to either (1) have the Student Account created at school by their teacher; or (2) create their own Student Account, such as with a username and password (which will require parental consent if not created in connection with a unique student code received from their teacher); or (3) have their parents create their Student Account at home after we have obtained
parental consent
.
If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize
Student Accounts
in school or otherwise sets up a Student’s Account, the school will be responsible for providing
parental consent
under COPPA. Teachers may provide parental consent through what is commonly referred to as “school consent” under COPPA, where teachers have certified that they are acting as the agent of the parent and consenting on the parent’s behalf to create the
Student Account
on behalf of the student and let students use the Service for
educational purposes
.  For clarity, while it is ClassDojo’s obligation to comply with COPPA as a whole, we rely on schools to provide consent under COPPA by acting as the agent of the parent, but only after providing the school with the required notices set forth
here
. For more information on "school consent" under COPPA, please see the
FTC's FAQ Section N
as well as the FTC’s
Policy Statement on Education Technology and COPPA.
School leaders
also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo. They can share notes, provide school Feedback Points, create events, and post photos and videos on School Story. Only authorized parents and guardians connected to the school can see these posts. School leaders can also create classes and events, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students, post to Class Story and Portfolios, add Portfolio Comments, message with parents,
manage their school’s directory
, give school staff ‘Admin’ permissions, and see
Highlights
of their school. District authorized users may also use ClassDojo with
certain features
available at the district level (“District Users”).
Out of School Use
Parents may optionally purchase
Premium Features
, including to help encourage their children at home. Parents may also create an
Outside School Child Account
for their child to use ClassDojo not connected to a school (only after we have obtained
parental consent
). Any at-home points (“
Home Points
”) and content uploaded through use in an Outside School Child Account are not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students, but the customization of the monster through Premium Features may show up in the child’s Student Account and viewable in school (e.g., by teachers, school leaders, and other students).
Children may use ClassDojo in the non-school context with their Outside School Child Account, with their parent's consent, including with certain Premium Features and using Dojo Islands for home use (“
Home Island
”). For more information on the distinction between a Student Account and Outside School Child Account please see
here
.  Guest child users that do not otherwise have a ClassDojo account in connection with either home or school use may also be invited by a current Home Island child user (e.g. via a QR Code) to enter Home Island (“Home Island Guest Users”). Home Island Guest Users will have limited functionality and ClassDojo will either (i) not collect any
personal information
from such Home Island Guest Users or (ii) only collect limited device or other persistent identifiers that may be considered personal information (and not further collect any other personal information) solely for providing support for the internal operations of Home Island (e.g. to authenticate).
Parents can also use our AI technology tools to help them provide enriching educational experiences at home (“Parent AI Tools”). For instance, a coloring page could be generated based on what the parent inputs about the child’s interests. Parents can also message with other parents (“Family Chat”) or create groups with various digital communication features (“Family Communities”) to engage with other parents.
Users can utilize either the ClassDojo Apps or the ClassDojo Platform - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other.
More information on how the Service operates is located
here
.
Basically,
ClassDojo is a platform that brings school leaders, teachers, students, and parents together. ClassDojo can be used by
School Leaders
, teachers,
Admins
, students, and families at school for communication, feedback, classroom management, and to play in their Class Island on Dojo Islands. ClassDojo can also be used by families at home, including with children using their
Outside School Child Account
for the Home Island, or to use
Premium Features
like Home Points.  Learn more

How does ClassDojo protect Children's Personal Information?
Please see our Children’s Privacy Policy
here
What information does ClassDojo collect?
We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the Service (described below under “
Information You Provide to Us
”) and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under “
Information We Collect Automatically
”). We may also receive information about you from third-party sources (as described below under “
Information Received from Third-Party Sources
”
). The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether you are signed up as a teacher,
School Leader
, District User,
Admin
, parent or guardian, student or Outside School Child User and how you use ClassDojo (e.g., if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information). We have also created
this chart
with the detailed categories of
personal information
we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.
Basically,
ClassDojo asks for some information directly from teachers, School Leaders, parents, Outside School Child Users and students (such as account information), and also collects some information automatically (such as crash reports when errors occur) in order to provide you with the best possible ClassDojo experience. Please see
this chart
for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.
Information You Provide To Us
We ask for and collect the following
personal information
about you when you use the Service. When we act as a
Controller
, this information is necessary either for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, or to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services. Our use of the information set forth below is described in the section “
How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects
”
There are currently seven categories of users on our Service: teachers,
School Leaders
, Admins, District Users, parents and guardians, students, and Outside School Child Users.  Additionally, as a non-logged-in visitor to the ClassDojo Website, you may provide personal information to us as set forth in our separate
ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy
. We describe the information collected from students and Outside School Child Users in our
Children’s Privacy Policy
; for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:
School Use
Account Sign-up and Profile Information:
To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher,
School Leaders
,
Admin
, District User or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password, date of birth, relationship to a child (e.g. parent, grandparent), and an optional profile photo. As a teacher, school leader, or Admin, you may be asked to
upload a copy
of your school ID as well to help us verify you and to enhance our security.  You may also choose to sign up through an
Authentication Service.
A district may also choose to integrate with the Service through using an integrated Student Information System (“SIS”) and any teacher, School Leader, Admin and parent account information will be collected directly from the school or district through such SIS as instructed and allowed by that district or school. Additionally, this information may be provided to ClassDojo through a third party
service provider
(e.g. Edlink) collecting this information directly from the district or school through the district’s SIS as instructed and allowed by that district. If an account uploaded to ClassDojo from the SIS is then subsequently removed from the SIS, it will also be removed from ClassDojo. See here more information on the SIS integration. You acknowledge that ClassDojo may disclose your name, email and mobile number to third parties in connection with the processing of identity or account verification, fraud detection or as may otherwise be required by applicable law.  Parent profiles may be viewed by other teachers, school leaders and school admin in the same school as well as parents connected to the school or class; however, no parent, or student or Outside School Child Account profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.
If a student’s teacher is creating the Student Account, on behalf of the student, they will provide the student’s first and last name, date of birth, and connected family. When the Student Account is created in the classroom, the Student Account will be associated with a school and the school location as well as the class and the class’s grade.  If the school or district is using an integrated SIS (or has authorized a third party service provider (e.g. Edlink) to provide this directly to ClassDojo) this information will be collected directly from the school or district, instead of from the teacher, through such SIS as allowed and instructed by that district or school. Additionally, teachers may choose to allow students to log in on the Service using an Authentication Service, such as through their Google for Education or other Google Accounts (“Google Login(s)”). Please see
here
for more information on Google Login and
here
for more information on Authentication Services. For more information on Student Accounts, please see our
Children’s Privacy Policy
. This same information is also used to create the Student Account on the parent’s behalf (the parent does not currently need to provide any additional
personal information
of their child if a parent is connected to the child with the
unique parent code
). Please see our
Children’s Privacy Policy
for more information on the parent creating their child’s Student Account.  Teacher, School Leader, Admin and parent profiles may be viewed by other teachers, School Leaders and Admins in the same school as well as parents connected to the school or class; however, no parent, or student or Outside School Child Account profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.
School Information and Collaboration Features:
If you are a teacher,
School Leader
, or
Admin
, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher, School Leader, Admin or parent or guardian, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you, including to help connect your parent account to your child’s school (e.g., our
“Find a Teacher”
feature) or to help us protect and secure your account and the Services (e.g. to prevent suspicious accounts). This location data is only temporarily captured and not stored beyond the initial search request for schools near the user and is not viewable by other users. For school personnel, the Service may enable and provide additional features (e.g. School Story and School Directory after connecting you to your school and
verifying your position
. Learn more about our current
collaboration features
and what information may be collected and shared from teachers, School Leaders, Admins, students and parents and who can view these stories
here
.
Class Information and School Directory:
As a teacher,
School Leader
, or
Admin
, you enter the grade level of your class, the first and last names of the students in your class or school, class name (or list of class names), school name and location, and may optionally enter their parents’ name and email addresses or phone numbers in order to invite parents. Alternatively, teachers, Admins or School Leaders can also upload a document, image, or spreadsheet to the Service (including through using the AI Productivity Tool) with the students’ first and last names, and a list of the student’s parents, or choose students from the
School Directory
if they are already in a class within the school.  If the school or district is using an integrated SIS (or has authorized a third party
service provider
(e.g. Edlink) to provide this directly to ClassDojo) this information will be collected directly from the school or district through such SIS as allowed and instructed by that district or school. When teachers approved into a school add new students to their class, those students are automatically added to the School Directory.  If a teacher or School Leader invites the student’s parents or guardians, and the parents or guardians create accounts and connect to their child, the parents’ or guardians’ email addresses are shown in the School Directory next to the student. The School Directory can only be viewed by verified teachers, School Leaders and ClassDojo Admins.  If a parent would like to have their email removed from the School Directory, they should reach out to their child’s school or disconnect from their child.
If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or School Leaders in their school or outside their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class’s information, excluding one to one parent-teacher messages.  Teachers outside of the school will not have access to the School Directory or see individuals outside of the class. When teachers or school leaders
graduate a class
, all students (along with their connected parent and their contact information) in the class get moved to a “Graduated Students” section in the School Directory. Teachers or School Leaders can choose to remove them from the school at this point, after which they will no longer be visible to anyone in the school, but will still remain on our servers until a deletion request is made by the appropriate School Leader.
Inviting Others and Approving Parents:
As a teacher, School Leader, or Admin, you can invite other teachers or as a teacher or School Leader you can
invite your students’ parents
to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo. If your school or district is using an integrated SIS, (or has authorized a third party service provider (e.g. Edlink) to provide this directly to ClassDojo), ClassDojo will send out these invites for school staff to join ClassDojo on behalf of your school once the information is passed to ClassDojo as directed by the school or district. When a parent seeks to join the class through the “
proactive parent flow
” or through a class link shared by a teacher, they will be able to see the first name and last initial) of some students in that class to help them select the right student to connect to. A parent will not be connected to the child through the proactive parent flow or class link until a
verified teacher
has approved the parent’s connection request. See the
FAQ
for more information.  ClassDojo may also use this verified teacher’s approval (or verification) of the parent as a method to verify the parent for COPPA
parental consent
purposes (including for parental consent for non-school use of the Services).
As a parent, you can also invite others to join the Service, including to allow for sharing of your purchased
Premium Features
(once the family member has joined ClassDojo). We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests and will also treat this as
personal information
in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you from having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at

Dojo for Districts:
A centralized dashboard for managing staff rostering and SSO information, retrieving messaging records, district level announcements and messaging, analytics on school usage and accessing ClassDojo customer support at the district level.
School Leaders
and certain District Users will be able to view this. The information collected here is from the previously disclosed “Account Sign-Up and Profile Information” section above, but presented in a centralized manner.  In addition, we will collect messages from District Users,  as well as product and event logs that take place within this dashboard.
Schoolwide Center:
Teachers, school admin, and School Leaders with a ClassDojo account and
verified
in a school can express interest in using ClassDojo schoolwide (e.g., by clicking the “I’m interested” button in the Schoolwide Center). Certain information may be provided to ClassDojo by the teacher, school admin, or School Leader, such as the interest, name, and the number of teachers at their school. This information is also made available to other teachers, school admins, and School Leaders verified in the school and is used by ClassDojo to provide extra services (such as early access to new products or swag), and support regarding the Services in product and through email. In addition, we use a third party service provider to help schedule meetings with our Districts team, which may collect contact information as well as certain cookie information as set forth in their cookie notice. You can learn more
here
.
Sharing Content:
As a teacher, parent, ClassDojo Admin, or School Leader, you can share certain content (e.g., as a parent within
Premium Features
, or a teacher sharing a Class Invite Link)) by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example, by email or SMS or integrating with other applications on your device (e.g. WhatsApp). Students or Outside School Child Users cannot share content through native applications on the device.
Messaging:
As a teacher or School Leader, you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service. Teachers, Admins, and School Leaders can also send one-way announcements to all connected parents in your school, or send group messages to connected parents in your school (which parents can respond to) through
ClassDojo Messaging
. Additionally, as a teacher, you can send messages to other teachers, Admins, and School Leaders (“Staff Messaging”).  As a parent, you can also message with your child’s teacher through ClassDojo Messaging. Please note that District Users have the ability to view these messages. District Users can also send broadcast messages (that do not display parent names - e.g. similar to a “BCC”) to users within the schools that make up the districts.
As a teacher, School Leader,  Admin, or parent or guardian, your first and last name (or last initial only if you choose) and profile photo and your connected child’s first name and last initial may be displayed to the teacher as well as the people with whom you are messaging, including through ClassDojo Messaging. Parents can choose to block certain individuals or opt out of
Family Chat
if they don’t want to be visible to others in the school. If you are a teacher or School Leader, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing which parents have read your message and in what language. Additionally, parents may elect to turn on a Premium Feature that allows them to know if a teacher has read their messages and may similarly receive a ‘read receipt’ telling them the teacher has read the message.  We will collect and store messages from
ClassDojo Messaging
and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos or videos), to provide the Service, and for ClassDojo Messaging, to help teachers, ClassDojo Admins, and School Leaders keep a log of their communications with parents. For more information on how long these are retained, please see
here
.
Please be aware that by using ClassDojo Messaging any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, and teachers and school leaders that are part of that message.
In the case that a photo or video is shared through ClassDojo Messaging showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), or if any user needs to otherwise
report any abuse
or inappropriate content sent through ClassDojo Messaging that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by reporting the user or content directly to ClassDojo
here
, using the
reporting mechanism
within the Service, or emailing us at
safety@classdojo.com
.  Please note that ClassDojo may not be able to remove certain content as the content may be deemed an “education record” under FERPA or any applicable law (including in international jurisdictions). If a photo or video is considered an “education record” you will need to first contact your child’s school to request removal. For more information on when photos or videos are considered an “education record” please see the Department of Education’s guidance
here
.
Stories:
As a teacher,
Admin
, or
School Leader
, you can post text, photos, videos, or files to connected families in your class or school through
Class Story
or
School Story
.  Parents or guardians can react to or comment on these posts and can also “favorite” a photo or video. For a list of what students can do and what information we collect on a Class Story or School Story, please see our
Children’s Privacy Policy
. Teachers, Admins, or School Leaders will be able to see who has viewed these posts. Teachers’, Admins’, and School Leaders’ profile pictures and last name will be visible to others if they post or comment on Class or School Story.  If parents comment or like a post, their profile pictures and child’s first name and last initial will be visible to others who view Class Story or School Story posts. If students comment on a story post, their monster avatar, first name and last initial will be visible. We will collect and store the content from Class Stories and School Stories, including any photos or videos, comments and reactions (e.g. “likes”) to provide the Service, and to help teachers and School Leaders keep a log of their communications with parents. Additionally, we may use the “favorites” to show parents a private collection of “favorite” photos or videos. For more information on how long these are retained, please see
here
.  We combine Class and School Story posts (which may include the child’s name, class details, and photos) into a unified single feed for authorized
Admins
, including
School Leaders
. This consolidated information is used by
School Leaders
to enable more visibility into school activities, including to track, monitor and engage with school activities effectively.
School Leaders
can access all Story posts from individual classes and the entire school in chronological order and can like and comment on any story in the combined feed, and view engagement details on each post, but currently can only add posts to School Stories, not Class Stories.
A teacher (or parent) may choose to select certain photos of their students (or child/children) previously posted on their students' (or child’s) Class Stories to be included in digital photo albums called
Dojo Photobooks
. We will send these selected photos as well as class details (e.g., class year, grade level) about the student to a
service provider
to create
Dojo Photobooks
. These may include photos of the student’s class activities, projects, or school events, and will be made available for any parent to print and purchase.
Please be aware that by using
Class Story
or
School Story
, any posts, photos, videos, comments or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, teachers, students (whose teacher has allowed student access to Story to be on) and School Leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a Class Story or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), or if any user needs to otherwise
report any abuse
or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at
safety@classdojo.com
to request removal, subject to any photo or record being deemed an “education record” under FERPA or any applicable law. If a photo or video is considered an “education record” you will need to first contact your child’s school to request removal. For more information on when photos or videos are considered an “education record” please see the Department of Education’s guidance
here
.
School Calendar and Events:
Teachers, Admins, and School Leaders can create school or class events using the native ClassDojo calendar function which will capture information such as date, time, the name of the event and event details the teacher inputs as well as any photo or image used for the theme of the event.  The calendar event will be shown to any School Leaders, teachers, Admins and parents connected to that teacher’s class or school in their Class or School Story feeds.  Parents can sign up for the event, and we will collect the role that they plan to do for the event (e.g. chaperone), and display their name, their child’s first name and last initial, and role to the parents and teachers connected to the class. The teacher may also opt to send reminders to parents about the events.
Portfolio Comments:
Teachers can add Portfolio Comments to their students’ portfolio content (including prior to any content being shown to the student’s parent). Once the teacher has approved the student-uploaded Portfolio post, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable to the child’s parent (but may have been edited by the student or teacher prior to being shown to the parent). Prior to this approval, any Portfolio Comments between the teacher and the student can’t be viewed by the student’s parent, but any connected parent will
receive a notice
indicating that the Portfolio Comments feature is being utilized by their child’s teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child’s teacher. Please see our Children’s Privacy Policy for more detail on student Portfolios, including the content students may provide and how parents may interact with their child’s Portfolios.
User Generated Content (photos, videos, photographs, documents or audio files):
Teachers, School Leaders and parents may upload photos, videos, and other content, including content that may contain
personal information
and can be viewed by others, on the Service, for example, on Class Story or School Story, through Class Dojo Messaging, Portfolio Comments and
Premium Features
. Learn more about what information may be collected and shared from teachers, School Leaders, students, and parents through Class Stories and School Stories and who can view these stories
here
. Additionally, teachers can post
Activities on ClassDojo
. Once a teacher publishes such Activities, they can be viewed by their students, other teachers connected to their class, and by other teachers that ClassDojo may share with pursuant to the
Terms of Service
(unless a teacher opts-out), but they will not be viewable by the general public. Parents can also download certain content from a Class Story or School Story or access advanced reporting, additional downloads, and other formats, by purchasing our Premium Features, but must first confirm that they are giving us consent to use any content that might be deemed an “education record” or “
Student Data
” in this manner. Please see our
FAQ
for more information.
Feedback Points:
As a teacher,
Admin
, or
School Leader
, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using
Feedback Points
, such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership.
Feedback Points
may be awarded by the teacher,
School Leader
, or authorized
Admins
to the student (including both points awarded in the classroom or points awarded in school outside the classroom). These Feedback Points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s Feedback Points and any notes school personnel add about the point can only be viewed on ClassDojo as set forth below:
Classroom feedback points
: These points can be awarded to the student by the student’s teacher, and are viewable by the student, the student’s teacher (who awarded them), any connected parent accounts (if the teacher has elected to show them to the parent), and
School Leaders
. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual feedback points). We may also present aggregate summaries (e.g. of total percentage) of Feedback Points awarded by the teacher along with any photos from a Class Story or School Story to parents.
School-wide feedback points
: These points can be awarded by any
School Leader
, teacher, or
Admin
for activities outside of the classroom (such as responsibility, teamwork, respect, compassion). They can be viewed by the student, any connected parent accounts,
School Leaders
, and
Admins
. Other teachers may see these points in the process of awarding a point to a student.
As an additional privacy measure, the ClassDojo platform automatically sets limits on how long Feedback Points are retained. For all students, Feedback Points older than 12 months are automatically deleted (or
de-identified
and anonymized) on a rolling 12-month basis(and associated comments will be  deleted automatically after 12 months). For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2024, any Classroom Feedback Points given in that class on or before January 1, 2025, would be deleted (or
de-identified
and anonymized) by January 1, 2026 (and no longer viewable by any ClassDojo user). This means that Feedback Points and associated comments cannot exist long-term. Teachers can also delete Feedback Points at any time.
Class Islands:
Teachers
may choose
to allow their students through the use of their Student Account to access and play on their
Class  Island
.  For more information on how teachers can turn their Class Island on or off, see
here
. Students can explore the Class Island, build, and play certain games within the Class  Island with their classmates. Please see our
Children’s Privacy Policy
for more information on what data is collected from students when using their  Class Island.  Please see our
FAQ
for what information is shared between the Home Island and a Class Island. Teachers can also participate on the Class  Island and we will collect activity and progress information, including their avatar, any monster parts or other virtual items unlocked or acquired, levels completed, building activities or other accomplishments, ClassDojo’s fictional currency earned or spent, and social connections (e.g. their student’s classmates or schoolmates of the same grade level).   ClassDojo may also collect the contents of communications between children within the
Class Island
.  If a user wishes to report any abuse or flag inappropriate content on ClassIslands, they may do so by reporting to their teacher or any in game reporting features.  ClassDojo may notify and share information about these reports with parents if follow-up is necessary based on the information collected.
AI Tools:
A teacher may choose to provide “inputs” (which may include
personal information
about their student, such as their name, class participation details, or homework responses) to the ClassDojo teacher
AI Classroom Tools
to generate various school-related content or “outputs”, such as
Class Story
posts, messages, assessments, thank-you notes, and report card comments. For instance, the student’s teacher might use the student’s name and class participation details to draft an editable
Class Story
post about a recent project or field trip, or draft an editable thank-you note or editable report card commentary. The content created through this process, including the AI-generated “outputs” from the AI Classroom Tools will only be shared with the student’s parents, the student, and authorized teachers and
Admins
.  Additionally, a teacher or Admin may choose to utilize the AI Productivity Tools not connected to classroom use (e.g. uploading rostering lists), but that may contain Student Data.  Users of AI Productivity Tools may choose to provide inputs that may contain student personal information and may also contain photos or videos (e.g. a photo of a classlist of students) and will not be just text-based. ClassDojo may also use certain AI Tools for its own internal use (“ClassDojo Internal AI Tools”) to provide features such as enhanced account security.  The ClassDojo AI Internal Tools will not use student or children’s
personal information
.  For more information on the “input” and “prompts” used to generate the AI “outputs”, as well as the information shared with our Large Language Model (“LLM”)
service providers
, please see our
AI Transparency Note
.
Account Linking:
Parents may choose to link their ClassDojo account with a Dojo Tutor Services or another ClassDojo service (“ClassDojo Additional Services”). If a parent signs up for the Dojo Tutor Services or  ClassDojo Additional Services using their ClassDojo account, ClassDojo may share and use the parent’s ClassDojo Services login credentials (e.g., ClassDojo email address, user name) and their child’s name (and possibly other limited fields of
Student Data
or
personal information
of the child that the parent allows) to pre-populate the parent’s Dojo Tutor Services or ClassDojo Additional Services profile. Parents will have been prompted with Direct Notice of, and will have consented to that use and sharing of their child’s
Student Data
and
personal information
for this use. While the child’s
personal information
(e.g., name) and tutoring information (e.g., tutoring assessments) will be linked and accessible in both the parent’s ClassDojo Additional Services, Dojo Tutor Services and ClassDojo Services accounts, the child’s
Student Account
information on ClassDojo will remain separate and viewable only through the parent’s ClassDojo Services login, ensuring that school information remains segregated and separate from non-school information.
Dojo Tutor Information:
Additionally, certain Dojo Tutor tutoring information, such as tutor assessments, feedback and other session information (e.g. session recordings) (“Dojo Tutor Information”) may be shared at the direction of the parent to their child’s teacher with the parent’s approval to the main ClassDojo Services (“Dojo Tutor Information Sharing”).  When this Dojo Tutor Information Sharing occurs with the ClassDojo Services, a copy of the Dojo Tutor Information will be made to share. This is a copy of the assessment and only this copy will become
Student Data
once the teacher has elected to save and bring this information into either their account or the student’s
Student Account
in the main ClassDojo Services. The child’s
Student Account
information on ClassDojo will remain separate, ensuring that school information remains segregated and separate from non-school information.  For more information, please see our
FAQ
.
Out of School Use
Account Sign-up and Profile Information
:  For details on what information we collect from a parent or guardian for the creation of their personal account for use of ClassDojo outside of school (for use not in connection with school purposes) (“Outside School Account”), please see the “
Account Sign-up and Profile Information
” information in the School section above. If the parent is creating their child’s account and is not connected to their child’s school (e.g. the Outside School Child Account), they may provide additional information about their child (such as first and last name and date of birth or age). We may pre-populate the child’s name when a parent uses their ClassDojo Services account to login to any existing
Dojo Tutor
account that the parent may have.  See the Dojo Tutor
Privacy Policy
for more details as well as the “Sharing of Student Data for Non-School Use” section below. Parent profiles may be viewed by other parents in Family Chat or Family Communities, but not the general public.
Messaging and Family Communities:
Parents can message other parents connected to their child’s school through
Family Chat
or through Family Communities. When a parent sends a message through Family Chat or Family Communities (or otherwise utilizes Family Communities), this is not considered part of the Service that is offered to schools and is not considered
Student Data
or an
education record
, and may contain messages and other content not related to the school (e.g. organizing play dates).  Please see our
FAQ
for more details, including the controls available to parents such as opting out of Family Chat or Family Communities. We will collect all messages sent within these features between parents (including any attachments) as well as any posts and related content (e.g. photos or videos), the community name a parent sets up, any information related to events the parent or other users may create, and the membership and activity related to each community the parent participates in. Additionally, parents will be able to receive email updates as well as enable push notifications regarding their Family Community.
Please note that while it is a parent’s choice to participate in Family Chat or Family Communities, they are automatically added to the list of available individuals that may be contacted by other parents and users. This list of available users is composed of the parents in your child’s current and former class and school as well as the parents of the children that your child may play with in Home Islands. Users will need to opt-out of Family Chat or Family Communities or choose other available options, such as “blocking” certain individuals. However, if a parent or other user has existing privacy settings that restrict who they want to be able to message with them (e.g. only teachers or School Leaders) ClassDojo honors this privacy setting and the user will not be automatically added to the available list of contacts.  This list of available users will display the parents name as well as their child’s first name and last initial and the associated class or school (e.g. Mrs. Johnson’s class). No child’s full name is shown by ClassDojo (unless the parent later opts to disclose). ClassDojo displays only the first name and last initial (not full name) of the child alongside the name of their parent to provide valuable context for other users to know how and why that user is connected (otherwise it may not be possible for users to recognize the name of the parent alone if it is not accompanied by the name of their child). This information is only shown to users logged into the ClassDojo Services and connected to that specific Family Community or Family Chat group.In addition, if a user needs to report any abuse or inappropriate content sent through Family Chat  or Family Communities, they may do so using the
reporting mechanism
within the application directly, or by emailing us at
safety@classdojo.com
.  Note that these reports within Family Chat  and Family Communities will not go to the school and the school (or district) will not have access to these messages or posts (unless separately invited to join as an individual community user).  Please be aware that by using Family Chat or Family Communities, any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, and users that are part of that message or community.
Home Points:
Parents are given a limited number of
Home Points
for use at home but can also choose to customize and award additional Home Points to their children through the
Premium Features
functionality. The Home Points may be combined with the
Feedback Points
earned in school for a combined points total. All points (
Home Points
or
Feedback Points
in school) are collected by ClassDojo and may be used by ClassDojo to provide the Service, including providing certain
Premium Features
(e.g. enhanced reports), sending
push notifications
or other
in-app notifications
to the child and for internal analytics on product usage. For all points (
Home Points
or
Feedback Points
in school) and the reports generated that show these points, we also collect product events (e.g., the number of points given, skill, which reports are viewed, etc.).These Home Points are only viewable by the connected parent account(s) and the child using their Outside School Child Account and are not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students. This content can be deleted by the parent. Additionally, parents can give a Home Point when they see that the child has received a Feedback Point from school to celebrate them (“Applause”).   A parent may choose to allow their child to access and use certain
Premium Features
within the child’s
Student Account
or their
Outside School Child's Account
.  Within Premium Features, parents can create
skills
or edit the set of skills provided (“Skills”). Parents can give Home Points for a specific skill and award a reward (“
Rewards
”) by redeeming the Home Points their child  has earned.  Parents can also create and edit the set of Rewards with Premium Features. Additionally, parents can set a “Goal” for a specific Skill and award Home Points to contribute towards that goal. Rewards and Skills given at home can only be accessed through the parent account or the child’s Outside School Child Account; teachers and other students are not able to see these Rewards or Skills or to contribute points to them.
Parent AI Tools:
Parents can use our Parent AI Tools. For instance, a coloring page could be generated based on what the parent inputs about the child’s interests. Or suggestions for how to explain a specific type of homework problem. In addition, ClassDojo may use the ClassDojo AI Internal Tools in connection with its Services provided not in connection with school use. The ClassDojo AI Internal Tools will not use student or children’s
personal information
. For more information on the “input” and “prompts” used to generate the AI “outputs”, as well as the information shared with our Large Language Model (“LLM”)
service providers
, please see our
AI Transparency Note
.  In connection with the Parent AI Tools, parents agree that they will not allow their child to use or interact with such Parent AI Tools unless they have separately provided
parental consent
.
Billing and Payment Information:
As a parent, when you purchase any
Premium Features
, you will first need to have your own parent account. You will then be required to use either your Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method to purchase the Premium Features. Prior to allowing your child (or children) access to the Premium Features within their Outside School Child Account (or if any children’s personal information, educational records or Student Data are utilized in the Premium Features that previously relied on “
school consent
”), we will also require
parental consent
. Please see our
FAQ
for more information. If a parent is purchasing Premium Features from within their child’s Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account on their mobile device, they will also need to go through a “
parental gate
” prior to purchasing. We do not collect any credit card information directly from parents to purchase Premium Features, however we may receive, from our payment processor, the last four digits of your credit card to search for specific transactions in case we want to issue a refund or other related customer support assistance. Please see
here
for a list of what information we receive from third-parties in connection with your payment method as well as what purchase events and analytics we track through our service providers in connection with your purchases. Parents may also share their Premium Features subscription with other parents through their account settings. Please see
here
for more information on sharing your Premium Features subscription.
Home Islands
:  If a child’s parent has given
parental consent
, their child, using their
Outside School Child Account
, may visit and play on their Home Island. Please see our
Children’s Privacy Policy
for more information on what data is collected from Outside School Child Users when using their Home Island as well as more details about what other children may see about the child while in Home Islands and how children can interact with each other. Parents may turn off the ability for their child to play in Home Islands. When a parent turns off the ability for their child to play on Home Islands, this will not turn off the ability for the child to play on the Class Island in school.  Please see our
FAQ
for what information is shared between the Home Island and Class Island.  Additionally, Home Island Guest Users may also be invited by a current Home Island child user (e.g. via a QR Code) to enter Home Islands but will have limited functionality as further set forth in our
Children’s Privacy Policy
and ClassDojo will either (i) not collect any personal information from such Home Island Guest Users or (ii) only collect limited device or other persistent identifiers (e.g. IP address ) that may be considered personal information (and not further collect any other personal information of the Home Island Guest User) solely for providing support for the internal operations (as that term is defined under COPPA) of Home Island (e.g. to authenticate the Home Island Guest User). ClassDojo will ensure that such persistent identifiers are not used for unauthorized purposes outside of support for the internal operations (as that term is defined under COPPA) through training, data access and data segregation and storage.
Dojo Sparks
: If a child’s parent has given
parental consent
, their child, using their
Outside School Child Account
, may use our “learn to read” features using speech recognition.  ClassDojo may collect and process your child’s voice recording from your child’s device microphone (e.g. through an iPad or Chromebook) in order to provide our automated speech recognition (“ASR”) services. We may then send this audio recording and de-identified identifiers to a third-party
service provider
for ASR processing; the
service providers
will then provide back the ASR analysis and related metadata. This data (voice recording and ASR analysis) will be retained only transiently for processing by our third-party
service provider
, and then deleted.  ClassDojo will separately retain the voice recordings for a limited time period as well as the ASR analysis performed by the
service providers
as set forth in our Children’s Privacy Policy.  We further limit the use of the ASR data by the third party
service provider
to provide the ASR service to ClassDojo for your child and would not allow this service provider to use this ASR data to improve their product or train ASR models.
Data That May Be Collected in Either School or Outside School Use
Surveys:
Your responses to surveys that we or our
service providers
might ask you to complete for internal research purposes and product improvement.  These surveys may also ask for your name and email as well as other free form and multiple-choice fields.  We may also ask parents or teachers survey questions about their usage, opinions of or familiarity with ClassDojo features we are working on or considering as input into improving the product. We will not collect survey information of Student or Outside School Child Users under 13.
Testimonials:
We may collect certain
personal information
(such as your name, photo, and/or video) if you choose to give us a testimonial. We post testimonials on our Service which may contain this personal information in the testimonial. We obtain the individual’s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request the removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us at
privacy@classdojo.com
.
Conduct and Safety Information:
If a user reports another user on the Service (e.g. such as through a “report abuse” button) for conduct or safety issues, ClassDojo collects the information provided in the report (e.g. the username, the content being reported (including a screenshot of the reported content or incident), the reason for reporting, and may also collect the timestamp, relevant class or school information (such as class name, teacher’s email, and school verification status)). This information is used to investigate the report (e.g assess and address offensive content), and to keep the platform safe and secure.
Contact Information and Correspondence with ClassDojo:
As a user of the Service, you may choose to provide us with your
personal information
, such as a name, email address, and telephone number. Some examples include when you send us an email asking a question, communicate with customer support, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts, including a customer feedback session with ClassDojo to improve the Service. We collect records and copies of your correspondence (including email address and messages) when contacting us for support.  When you send us a message using the “Contact Us” page or via email, the email addresses and phone numbers collected are not further used to market to the individual beyond providing the services requested or responding to the requests.
User Testing:
We may conduct Zoom-recorded playtests and interviews to gather insights on new ClassDojo features like Dojo Islands. To that end, we may collect minimal information from the individual participating that is needed for the tests, including name and email address, device-specific information (as noted below), test session details (e.g., interaction data and feedback from participants), communication contents, general location, Zoom recordings, and related product and event logs.
Zoom
may also collect the following from the device: information about the speakers, microphone, camera, OS version, hard disk ID, PC name, MAC address, WiFi information, and other device information (like Bluetooth signals). Please see
Zoom’s Children’s Education Privacy Statement
for more information. We disclose the information we collect from children that may participate in user testing in our Children’s Privacy Policy as set forth here.
We use this user testing data for internal analytics to improve ClassDojo’s features.  We retain the data only as needed, and delete the recordings from Zoom after 14 days, but may retain the recordings on our servers (or elect to have Zoom retain these) for as long as necessary to conduct the internal analysis or as allowed by law.
If you are using the ClassDojo App, we may ask you for certain permissions – please see
here
for more detail about those permissions. We have also prepared
this chart
of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.
Basically,
We ask you for different types of information based on who you are (i.e., teacher, School Leader, Admin, parent, student, or Outside School Child User) and which ClassDojo features you use (e.g., sending a message between a teacher and a parent, or helping a teacher or parent join their school). We have also prepared
this chart
of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.
Information We Collect Automatically
When you use the Service, we (or our
service providers
) may use various technologies that automatically record or collect certain information, including
personal information
from your browser or your device about the services you use and how you use them. This information is necessary given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, and in some circumstances may be necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us. In certain cases, we may also process this information to enable us to comply with legal obligations. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.
The technologies and information we automatically collect include:
Cookies and other similar technologies:
We (or our
service providers
) may use
cookies or similar technologies
to identify your browser or device. We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in Student or Outside School Child User logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Service that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site). We don’t allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our Service (i.e. such as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but for non-student users, we may serve
contextually relevant advertising
(which means not using personal information to make decisions) for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g., our co-created content with
Yale University on Mindfulness
). Please see our Children’s Privacy Policy for details on any first party cookies or other similar technologies we may use in any children’s section of our Services.  Please read our
Online Tracking Technologies Policy
for more details, including how to modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.
Local storage
:
We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage (including HTTP cookies and HTML5) and application data caches.
Like many services, ClassDojo (or our service providers) uses both local storage and cookies and other similar technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our users, understand your engagement with the Service, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you -–for example, by remembering your language preferences or other information so that you will not have to re-enter it during the next time you visit the Services. Please read our
Online Tracking Technologies Policy
for more details.
Device information:
We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version, settings file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, device token (to send push notifications) and device identifiers (including unique device IDs). We may also collect device event information such as crashes, system activity, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them.
Mobile application information:
The information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the ClassDojo App, when you open the application, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help us debug and improve the ClassDojo App.
Server log information:
Like most online services, when you use our Service we automatically collect and store certain information in our
server logs
. Examples of what’s associated with these logs include things like:
Telephone log information like your phone number and SMS routing information
IP address
Feature used
Email
We may use your IP address and share it with service providers to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Service, to enhance the Services based on usage pattern data and for analytics and for advertising. Third party sharing of
IP address
information for analytics and advertising is not allowed for student and Outside School Child Users. We automatically delete IP address tracked in server logs after six months.
Location information:
When you use our Service, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example, based on your IP address. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we request precise geolocation information (“precise” meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We
never
request precise geolocation data from students or Outside School Child Users. From all users, if they upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo’s own application camera, we collect what the device sends us. If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file -–e.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data). We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the person receiving a message). If a user accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device’s own camera roll).
We will not store or track your precise device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geolocation data with third-parties, other than our
service providers
as necessary to provide the Service or for security and safety purposes. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your precise location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.
Cross-device collection:
To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using, such as with our syncing technology,
DojoCast
. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.
Product events:
As users interact with the product, we collect product events about how the product is being used (e.g., the number of points given, which reports are viewed, which features are used, which buttons are clicked, load time, etc.). This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next -– for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular and to send notifications to a device (such as push notifications if the user opted in) to encourage the user to finish an activity or start the next activity.  These are collected to provide the Services, including for internal analysis on product usage and quality. We may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending push or email notifications to the parent’s, teacher’s, or student’s device to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service. Our product event logs may also include unique device IDs and
IP addresses
.  We automatically delete IP addresses tracked in product logs after six months.
Basically,
We collect some information from you automatically (and additionally use
cookies
and other similar technologies to collect information) so that we know when things go wrong, or to help us understand what parts of ClassDojo need some improvement. If we need to request street-level (“precise”) geolocation data from you as a teacher, school leader, or parent, we’ll ask for your explicit, opt-in consent. We never request precise geolocation data from students or Outside School Child Users.
Information Received from Third Party Sources
We may also obtain information, including
personal information
, from
third-party sources
to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us (e.g. survey information or information about the name of teachers and address of schools). If we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading “
Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information
”. Local law may require you to authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. We do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties. Please see
this chart
with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.
Basically,
We may collect some information from third-party sources, such as SurveyMonkey when we send questionnaires to teachers and parents. That information will be handled under this Privacy Policy. Please see
this chart
with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we  disclose personal information for a business purpose.
How Does ClassDojo use the information it collects?

Yale University on Mindfulness
). ClassDojo commits that its collection, use, retention and sharing of personal information shall be reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the personal information was collected or processed and for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy and
Information Transparency Chart
and that the personal information will not be further processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes. We also offer a
Student Data Privacy Addendum
, an agreement we enter into with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to
Student Data
that we collect or receive.
We use your
personal information
only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Our use of information collected from students and Outside School Child Users using the Service is set forth in our
Children’s Privacy Policy

Please note that we may anonymize and/or
de-identify
information collected through the Services or via other means so that the information no longer relates to you. Subject to applicable laws, where we have anonymized and/or
de-identified
information so that it no longer identifies you personally, our use and disclosure of such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
Basically,
ClassDojo doesn’t
sell
or rent your information to third-parties, we don’t permit
third-party advertising

Account Linking & Student Data
Please see the “Account Linking” section above and “Sharing Student Data for Non-School Use” section of the
Children’s Privacy Policy
for more information.
Will ClassDojo Share any information it collects?
ClassDojo
does not
sell
or rent
your (or your child’s)
personal information
to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes.
Third-party advertising
is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to ClassDojo and personal information collected from students and Outside School Child Users is never used for
behaviorally-targeted advertising
to students or Outside School Child Users (by us or third-parties). Furthermore, we do not disclose personal information with any third-parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy and as set forth below:
Other Users You Share and Communicate with on ClassDojo
: No teacher, School Leader, Admin, parent or guardian, student, or Outside School Child User profiles are made available to the general public through our Service. Furthermore, students cannot share their
account information
or
Portfolio
with anyone on ClassDojo, outside of their parents, teachers (including those at other schools), Admins, or School Leaders. Students can see other students’ names (both classmates and schoolmates of the same grade) and avatar and send a limited set of communications on Dojo Islands Island. Similarly, Outside School Child Users, can also see this information on their Home Island. More information is covered in
“How Does Classdojo Protect Children’s Personal Information?”
.  When using the Service certain information is automatically shared, such as your name and relationship to a child in a class, with other users in the school. If you are a teacher, School Leader, Admin, or a parent, you may also choose to share information or content through the Service with other ClassDojo teachers, School Leaders, students, or parents. For example, this could be information like your account information,
Feedback Points
awarded to students you teach (if you are a teacher or School Leader) or Home Points to your children (if you are a parent) or other information you share with teachers, School Leaders, or parents you are communicating with through
ClassDojo Messaging
, Family Messaging, Class Story, School Story, Portfolios, or our other collaboration features. Students can also comment and add “likes” on Class Stories which are shared with other logged-in users who have access to that particular Class Story.
Please keep in mind that information (including
personal information
) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other ClassDojo users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers and School Leaders you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information and we are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information or content by others.
Third-Party Integrations on our Service
: When, as a teacher, School Leader, Admin, student, Outside School Child User, or parent, you use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when as a teacher or parent you share a
Big Ideas activity
on Twitter or Facebook, or as a teacher you provide third party links or integrations for your students, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality and information that you are sharing from ClassDojo. Please see
here
for more information on third-party services. Please see
here
for a list of third-party app integrations on our Service.
Service Providers
: We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf. These service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We may need to share or provide information (including
personal information
) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. We may also authorize these third-party companies to collect information on our behalf. These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed. Additionally, these partners and service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see
here
for a list of the third-parties we work with to provide the Service.
Social Media Platforms:
Where permissible according to applicable law, we may share certain limited personal information with social media platforms (such as Google or Facebook) and other websites, applications or partners, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise market and recommend our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students or Outside School Child Users). We may also share certain personal information (never of student or Outside School Child User) with social media platforms and other websites to ensure that these individuals are not marketed to on these platforms. We will seek to take a privacy preserving method, such as a hash, when sharing, if possible. These processing activities, when we are acting as a Controller, are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you ClassDojo products and services that may be of your interest.  These social media platforms with which we may share your personal information may only process the data we share on our behalf.  However, because these social media platforms are ultimately separate companies from ClassDojo, any questions regarding how your social media platform processes your personal information should be directed to such provider. You may also choose to contact us here if you would like to opt-out of any such sharing.
Analytics Services
: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. A current list of analytics providers that we use is located
here
.
Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information:
As allowed by applicable laws, and in compliance with our
Student Data Protection Addendum
,we may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other
de-identified
or non-personally identifiable information (such as statistics about visitors, traffic and usage patterns) with third parties, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how the Service  is used, spot industry trends, assist third parties in understanding our users’ interest and usage patterns, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo. Any aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any
personal information
. If your school or district has entered into a custom
Student Data Protection Addendum
, any additional restrictions on the disclosure of
Student Data
or
de-identified
data will also be set forth there.
Legal Requirements
: We may disclose information, including
personal information
, if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena, or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our
Terms of Service
or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, responding to law enforcement and government requests and defending ourselves against third-party claims and allegations. Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon ClassDojo,  its users or the Service. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.
Fraud and Security Protection
: We may share information to assist with security operations for scheduled penetration testing, auditing, and continuous improvement of our security practices, including without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. Authorized parties of the information would comply with our current privacy and security policies.
Sharing with ClassDojo Companies:
Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize. We may share your
personal information
with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Change of control
: The
Student Privacy Pledge
requires us (and all pledgers) to commit to how we handle data in the event of a change to our organizations such that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, or in any other situation where
personal information
that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party. Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, if any, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company. We may also make information, including personal information, available to a potential investor or purchaser (or their advisors) in advance of any such transaction completion.
In the unlikely event that ClassDojo goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your
personal information
, and will not
sell
it to any third-party.  For more information on our practices regarding your data if we go out of business, please see our
FAQ
.
With your consent:
Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your
personal information
for any purpose unless you consent to it.
Basically,
ClassDojo doesn’t
sell
or rent your
personal information
to any third-parties. We believe your information is yours, and you should own it - we think that’s the right way to operate. We share some information with
service providers
who help us provide you with the Service – like companies that help us send emails, for example, or if we have to to comply with the law. Additionally, you may choose to share information with other users of the Service or to third-parties that are integrated on our Service.
And, if ClassDojo is ever acquired or goes out of business, our commitments don’t change: we still won’t
sell
or rent your personal information to anyone. Your
personal information
will continue to be protected by this policy, and any company that acquires ClassDojo will have to abide by this policy unless you give consent to a new policy.
How does ClassDojo protect and secure my information?
The security of your
personal information
is important to us. The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you and you should maintain good internet security practices. Where you have password-protected access to an account or certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password or QR code secure at all times. You should not share your password or QR code with anyone. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and
personal information
by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or mobile device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. If you think that any of your accounts have been compromised you should change your account credentials with us. In particular make sure any compromised account can’t access ClassDojo. We will never email you to ask for your password or other account login information. If you receive such an email, please send it to us so we can investigate.
We work hard to protect our community, and we maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the personal information designed to protect personal information from unauthorized or illegal use, destruction, disclosure, or access. In particular:
Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure
We perform application security testing; penetration testing; conduct risk assessments; and monitor compliance with security policies
We periodically review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems
Whenever we develop new features, we do in a manner to keep your personal information safe
We encourage enhanced security with multi-factor authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO)
We will challenge for additional authorization (including MFA) when our systems detect atypical activity
When you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS) by default
ClassDojo’s databases where we store your personal information are
encrypted at rest
. This converts your personal information into a form that unauthorized users can’t translate.
We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing.
The Service is hosted on servers at a
third-party facility
, with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures. For example, personal information is stored on a server equipped with industry-standard firewalls. In addition, the hosting facility provides a 24x7 security system, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and locked cage areas.
We automatically delete
inactive student accounts
and Outside School Child Accounts after a specific period of time, as per our retention policy, described in the “
How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?
” section.
We also operate a ‘bug bounty’ security program to encourage an active community of third-party security researchers to report any security bugs to us. More information on this is available by contacting us at
security@classdojo.com
.
We restrict access to personal information to authorized ClassDojo employees, agents or independent contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
For additional information on our security practices, please see our
Security Overview
and our
Privacy Center
.
Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use, or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws and school reporting requirements) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (
www.classdojo.com
) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
Basically,
The security of your information is important to us, and we take it very seriously. We’re always adding safeguards to ensure the safety and security of ClassDojo and our community of teachers, school leaders, parents, and students. You can help us out by keeping your password and QR code secret! When you enter personal information anywhere on the Service , we encrypt the transmission of that information using SSL by default. ClassDojo’s databases where we store your personal information are
encrypted at rest
, which converts all personal information stored in the database to an unintelligible form. Please see our
Security Overview
for more details.
How long does ClassDojo keep information about me?
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings.
You can read more about ClassDojo’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information
here
.
Non-Student Users
We store your
personal information
for as long as it is necessary to provide the Service to you and others, including those described above. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information being processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information, whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitations). The time periods for which we retain your personal information depend on the purposes for which we use it. Personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services, in which case we will delete prior to you deleting your account. Please see our
Information Transparency Chart
for more specific information on retention periods of specific personal information.
You can, of course,
delete your account
at any time. Please note that even if your account is deleted, messages sent between teachers and parents are retained to assist schools with various recordkeeping or compliance obligations. Additionally, some content uploaded by a teacher, school leader, or parent, including photos, videos, and Portfolio Comments on ClassDojo Messaging, Portfolios, Class Story, or School Story, are retained at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of “education records” under FERPA or “Student Data” under various state student privacy laws or equivalent laws in international jurisdictions) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school. Please note that we may also have to retain some information after your account is deleted or closed, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our
Terms
. For more details, please read “What happens when I delete my account?” in our
FAQs
.
Additional examples of when we may need to retain personal information after your account is deleted:

Please note that recent changes to the CCPA and other U.S. State Data Protection Laws are set to take effect in 2025; however, the rules implementing some of these laws have not yet been finalized. We are continuously working to better comply with these laws, and we will update our processes and disclosures as these implementing rules are finalized.

You have the right to know what kinds of
personal information
ClassDojo collects and the sources of that information, how we use that information, and our business purpose for that collection.  Please see
this chart
for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose, and information on retention periods for the categories of personal information (“Notice at Collection”).
Please see the “
What Information Does ClassDojo Collect
?” and the “
How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects?
” sections of our Privacy Policy for more information on the personal information we collect, the sources of that information and how we use this information.  Please also see the “

” and “

Your Rights and Choices
If you are a California resident or resident of any other state with an applicable U.S. State Data Protection Law, you have the right to request that ClassDojo disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, and disclosure of your
personal information
. Please see
this chart
for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose, and information on retention periods for the categories of personal information.
You also have specific rights of access, deletion, correction and data portability regarding your
personal information
under the CCPA and other applicable U.S. State Data Protection Laws. You have the right to request that ClassDojo provide the specific pieces of information that we have collected about you. We provide these same rights to all users regardless of location. Please see the “
ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Your Rights
” Section for more detail on how to exercise these rights, including how we will verify requests. The VCDPA, CPA and other applicable U.S. State Data Protection Laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. You may also designate a natural person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State (or your applicable state) to act on your behalf to exercise these rights.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under CCPA or any other applicable U.S. State Data Protection Law with a similar right. Unless permitted by the CCPA or any other applicable U.S. State Data Protection Law, we will not:
Deny you goods or services
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA, or any other applicable U.S. State Data Protection Law, that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted (or other U.S. State Data Protection Law) financial incentive we offer will be reasonably related to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
Basically,
If you are a U.S. resident with an applicable U.S. State Data Protection Law, such as the CCPA, VCDPA, CPA or UCPA, these laws afford you certain rights of access, deletion and data portability - which we also extend to all users. Please see the
ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Your Rights
Section for more detail on how to exercise these rights, including how we will verify requests. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the applicable U.S. State Data Protection Laws.

personal information
and is defined differently under applicable U.S. State Data Protection  Laws.  Please see our
Information Transparency Chart
for a list of any sensitive personal information that we may collect, use and disclose based on the applicable U.S. State Data Protection Laws. If you are a California resident, we do not use or disclose your

You can find those details by clicking on the
Notice of Collection
.
Do Not Share My Personal Information
ClassDojo does not
share
its users’ personal information to a
third party
for
cross-context behavioral advertising
, as those terms are defined under the CCPA. Furthermore, we do not share or disclose personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy and as set forth
here
.
If ClassDojo in the future does
share
or
sell
any personal information of a ClassDojo Services user located in California, we will provide the CCPA required “Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information” link in the footer of our website as well as honoring an Opt-Out Preference Signal as set forth below.  ClassDojo will not
share
or
sell
the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
Basically,
Currently, ClassDojo does not
share
its users personal information to a
third party
for
cross-context behavioral advertising
.  If ClassDojo in the future does
share
or
sell
any personal information of a Dojo Tutoring Services user located in California, we will provide the CCPA required “
Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information
” link in the footer of our website as well as honoring an Opt-Out Preference Signal as set forth below. ClassDojo will not
share
or
sell
the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.  For a list of third-party service providers we disclose information to, please see
here
.
Do Not Track or Opt-Out Preference Signal
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information to be “tracked”. While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators. For more information on “do not track,” please visit
www.allaboutdnt.org
. In addition, the industry working group (W3C Tracking Protection) to develop the DNT standard is now
closed
, so ClassDojo does not respond to these DNT signals. There are different (from DNT) opt-out preference signals set forth under the CCPA (“Opt-Out Preference Signals”) also called a Global Privacy Control (GPC) Signal.  ClassDojo will respond to Opt-out Preference or Global Privacy Control Signals. This signal will apply to the browser.  A consumer can use an Opt-Out Preference Signal by following the instructions
here
. ClassDojo takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
Third parties that have content embedded on the Service, such as a social feature, or an embedded video player, may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited the Service from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from the Service unless you provide it to them directly.
Basically,
ClassDojo does not respond to DNT signals as there is lack of industry standard and the working group to resolve these issues is also now
closed
.  However, if you are a user based in California, ClassDojo will respond to Opt-Out Preference or GPC Signals as those terms and signals are defined under the CPRA. This signal will apply to the browser and a consumer can use an opt-out preference signal by following the instructions
here
.
Notice for Minors (Users under 18)
If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a child using ClassDojo under the age of 18 residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you (the minor) have publicly posted on our Service. Currently, we do not allow minors to post content to share publicly, but if in the future this is a feature, you have this right to request removal. Minors can share content or comment on Class Stories which can only be seen by users with access to that particular class - such as other students, parents, and teachers. Additionally, ClassDojo offers various
interactive features
where minors can interact directly with each other.
Minors (or the minor’s parents if under 13) have the option to delete
personal information
associated with their user accounts or content that they upload through their Student Account on their Portfolio on Class Stories or content they may share with other children through their Outside School Child Account. If you are a minor, or the parent of a minor under 13, and would like to delete personal information associated with your Student Account or Outside School Child Account or content you uploaded through your Student Account or Outside School Child Account, please follow the directions set forth in the “
ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Your Rights
” section, which may include the need to contact your school first. Although we offer deletion capabilities on our Service, you should be aware that the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the Service, as there may be
de-identified
or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form. Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain at the direction of the school or under applicable laws.
Basically,
If you are a minor or parent of a minor, you may delete information per the "
How can I delete my account?
" section.
”Shine the Light” Law
Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83(c)(2), ClassDojo does not share
personal information
with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. California customers can receive more information about our compliance with this law or to make a request under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 by sending us an email at

Basically,
We will let you know by email and/or on our website when we make significant changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to the types of
personal information
we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents, or ask for their
consent

key terms
first.

Types of Information We Collect
On our corporate website, we collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you may choose to voluntarily provide us while using the Site (described below under “Information You Provide to Us” [LINK to section below] and (2) information collected automatically as a result of your use of the Site (described below under “Information Collected Automatically”[LINK to section below]).  We may also receive information about you from third-party sources as described below under “Information Received from Third-Party Sources” [LINK to section below].
Information You Provide to Us
You may choose to voluntarily provide certain
personal information
to us — such as name, telephone number, or email address in order to access certain features of our Site or request information from us.  For example, the Site allows you to request information about the ClassDojo product; register for special events; participate in surveys and contests; and to submit an application for employment.  To support these activities, ClassDojo will ask for information about you and / or the company for which you work.
When you send us a message using the
"Contact Us"
page or via email, we retain the content of the message, your email address, and any information you provide to us such as your name, phone number, your company, experience with our service, your contact preferences, and the response we send back to you.  This helps us manage any follow-up questions you may have, measure how effectively we address your concerns and improve the Site.  Any information retained would be used to assure the delivery of the services or information you requested and to optimize your experience and enhance the quality of the time you spend with us online.  When you send us a message using the "
Contact Us
" page or via email, the email addresses and phone numbers collected are not further used to market to the individual beyond providing the services requested or responding to the requests.
This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Site, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations.  Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services.
Information Collected Automatically
To provide a personalized and high-quality experience for our users, we (or our service providers) may use various technologies that automatically record or collect certain information from your browser or your
device
when you use the Site, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us.  This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Site.  For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to the Site (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).  If you visit the Site on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent service across your different devices or to provide you relevant ClassDojo advertisements. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with
personal information
, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.
The technologies and information we automatically collect include:
Cookies and other similar technologies:
We (or our
service providers
) may use
cookies or similar technologies
to identify your browser or device.  We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our user base, track your movements around the Site, administer the Site, tailor the Site for you, and to help the Site work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.  We (or our service providers) also may use these technologies (never in student logged-in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Services that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Site, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site).  For more information see the “Online Analytics, Advertising and Do-Not-Track” section below.
Local storage
:
We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage, including HTTP cookies and HTML5, and application data caches or plug-in based local storage such as
Flash Cookies
.  Like many services, ClassDojo uses these technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information, understand your engagement with the Sites, administer the Sites, tailor the Sites for you, and to help the Sites work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.  Third-parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based on your web browsing also may use HTML5 or other local storage to collect and store information. Please read our
Online Tracking Technologies Policy
for more details, including how to remove or modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.
Device Information
: We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and unique
device identifiers
.  This helps us measure how Sites are performing and improve the Sites for you on your particular device.
Location Information
: When you use our Site, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through
IP address
, GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.  We collect coarse (i.e., city-level) location data.  We never collect precise geolocation data from students using our Service.  We will not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission.  We do not share precise geolocation data with third parties, other than our
service providers
as necessary to provide the Site.  If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.
Server Log Information
: Like most online services, when you use our Site, we automatically collect and store certain information in our
server log files
.  Examples include:
Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Site, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Site
IP Address
Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL
This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least) popular.  We may use your IP address and share it with third-parties to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Site, to enhance the Site and services based on usage pattern data, for analytics and for advertising.
Cross-Device Collection
: To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using to provide a seamless experience across multiple devices and browsers without collecting or processing any additional identifying personal data.
Information Received from Third-Party Sources
We may also obtain information, including
personal information
, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically.  This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us.  If we receive personal information from third-parties we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect on the Site, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Additionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading “Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information”.  Local law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.  We do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties.
How We Use the Information We Collect
We use information, including
personal information
, collected through our Site for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including as set forth above under “Information Collected Automatically”.  In addition, we may use the information, including personal information, we collect for the following purposes:

Online Tracking Technologies Policy
.
We process this information given our legitimate interest in improving the Sites and our users’ experience with it, in protecting the Site, where necessary for the adequate performance of the contract with you, and to comply with applicable laws.
Additionally, we will process your personal information for the purposes listed in this section related to marketing given our legitimate interests in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest.  You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications or changing your notification settings within your ClassDojo account.

de-identify
information collected through the Sites or via other means so that the information no longer relates to you.

personal information
, to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, providing surveys, assisting with employment applications, and security.  We may also authorize these third-party companies to collect information on our behalf.  These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed.  Additionally, these partners and service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.  Please see
here

These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Site, the events that occur within the Site, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded.  The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  A current list of analytics providers that we use is located

Business Partners:
From time to time, ClassDojo may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services.  If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from ClassDojo, we may share information collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). ClassDojo does not control our business partners’ use of the information we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies.

These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest and to measure the performance of paid marketing initiatives.

Terms of Service
or other agreements.  This includes, without limitation,  responding to law enforcement and government requests.  Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon ClassDojo, or its users.  In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.
Fraud and Security Protection:
We may share the information to assist with security operations for scheduled penetration testing, auditing, and continuous improvement of our security practices, including without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.  Authorized parties of the information would comply with our current privacy and security policies.
Sharing with ClassDojo Companies
: Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize.  We may share your information, including
personal information
with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Change of Control
: In the event that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, or in any other situation where
personal information
that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party, we may disclose, share or transfer the information.  This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).  We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us.  If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.  We may also make information, including personal information, available to a potential investor or purchaser (or their advisors) in advance of any such transaction completion.
With your consent
: Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it. Additionally, as discussed above, we will never
sell
your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.
Online Analytics, Advertising and Do-Not-Track
Online Analytics Providers
We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics, to help us measure website traffic and usage trends for the Sites and to understand more about the demographics of our users. You can learn more about Google’s practices
here
, and view its currently available
opt-out options
.  These third-parties use technologies described in the “Automatically Collected Information” section above.  The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  A current list of analytics providers that we use is located
here
.
Advertising Technology Providers
Data about your activities on our Sites may be collected by us or by advertising technology providers for use in delivering online advertising tailored to your individual characteristics, activities, interests and other factors.  These ad services may track your online activities over time and across the web by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the various technologies described above, and they may use this information, and other information they receive from us or other sources, to deliver advertisements to you on our website, our emails, and other websites.  We and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together, and other automated technologies, and in some cases additional information, (i) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Sites or other factors and (ii) to report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Sites or other factors.
You may visit the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out page
or the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out page
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising based on your Internet browsing activities from companies that participate in those programs.  Some of our advertising-related activities may involve the services of companies that do not participate in those programs.  For example, we may use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our Website.  You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the
Google Ad Preferences page
.  The opt-outs apply only to the browser in which you set them.  For example, if you set the opt-out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt-out will not be active in Chrome.  To opt-out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt-out process.
The opt-outs described in this Privacy Policy do not block or delete cookies, or prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt-out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising.  Ads may be delivered based on other factors, such as the content of the web page in which they are shown, or demographic information obtained through other means.
Please read our
Online Tracking Technologies Policy
for more details, including how to remove or modify your cookie settings and a list of the advertising tracking technologies we use.
Do Not Track Disclosure
Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.  However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT.  For more information on “do not track”, please visit
www.allaboutdnt.org
.
Data Security and Retention
The security of your
personal information
is important to us.  To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or improper use of your information, and to maintain data accuracy, we’ve established physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the personal information we collect.  Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information.  Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (
www.classdojo.com
) or elsewhere on the Site, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
ClassDojo’s Commitments to Providing Transparency and Your Rights
As you can see, we try to be transparent about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.
You control the personal information you share with us.
You can access or rectify this information at any time.  You can also delete your account (if you have created one) or your personal information.  We also provide you tools to object, restrict, or withdraw consent where applicable for the use of personal information you have provided to ClassDojo.
You may exercise any of these rights described in this section by sending an email to
privacy@classdojo.com
or making a request
here
.  Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request.

Take information out of ClassDojo
Access, Correct or Delete Your Personal Information
ClassDojo aims to provide you with easy access to any
personal information
we have collected about you and give you easy ways to update it or delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business purposes (e.g., we need at least an email address for your account if you maintain an account with us) or legal purposes.  You have the right to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you.
You have a right to request access to all your
personal information
we have on file by emailing us at
privacy@classdojo.com
or by following the instructions
here
.  In some cases, we won’t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.
You may, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain
personal information
that you have provided to us by contacting us at
privacy@classdojo.com
.  When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.  More detail on how we will verify you is set forth here.  You may also exercise your control or choices with the communications we send you as set forth in “Communications from ClassDojo” section below.
We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.  Because of this, even after you update or delete personal information you have provided us from our Service, your personal information may be retained in our backup files and archives for a reasonable period of time as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety.  If you are a California resident, we may also retain personal information as set forth under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).  Please see our FAQ for more information if you are a California resident.
We may reject requests for access, change or deletion that are unreasonably repetitive (more than 2 times per year for access requests), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).  In some cases, we won’t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort or if more than two (2) times a year for access requests.
Object, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent
Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by ClassDojo you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your account settings or by sending a communication to ClassDojo specifying which consent you are withdrawing.  Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.  ClassDojo provides parents, teachers and other users with the opportunity to withdraw consent or ‘opt-out’ of receiving any future marketing communications from ClassDojo and its partners at any time.  Please see the “
Communications from ClassDojo
” section below for more information.  Additionally, you can always decline to share personal information with us, or even block all cookies.  However, it’s important to remember that many of the Site’s features may not be accessible, or may not function properly - for example, we may not be able to remember your language preferences for you.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require ClassDojo not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest.  If you object to such processing ClassDojo will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.  Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing as set forth below and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of ClassDojo override your own.

Children's Privacy Policy Highlights
We believe you should always know what data we collect from your child, how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We wanted to empower users to make the best decisions about the information that they share with us about their children. In fact, we made a
short video
for children that highlights the most important details in our
Services Privacy Policy
and Children’s Privacy Policy that they should know about. We offer a
Student Data Privacy Addendum
, an agreement we enter into with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to
Student Data
that we collect or receive.
This Children’s Privacy Policy applies solely to the ClassDojo Services (defined in the
Services Privacy Policy
) and does not apply to the informational website located at
https://www.classdojo.com
(the "ClassDojo Website"). The ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy is located
here
. Our full Services Privacy Policy for all users is located
here
. Additionally, if your child is using our
Dojo Tutoring product
, please find the Dojo Tutoring Privacy Policy located
here
.
You should read this policy in full, but here are the highlights:
Personal Information We Collect
: Please see
this page
where we detail the
personal information
we collect from each child (including students and children using the Service not connected to a school or classroom (“
Outside School Child Users
”), including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose. You can also find more details
below
.
How We Use the Information We Collect
: We use the
personal information
we collect from students and Outside School Child Users (or about students and Outside School Child Users from teachers and parents) to provide and improve (as allowed by law) the Service, for
educational purposes
, security, and safety purposes, including enforcing our Terms and addressing offensive content (including with the information collected through an Outside School Child User’s customer service reporting), to comply with legal process or other laws or as allowed by law. We will not require students or Outside School Child Users to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Service. See
here
for more information on our use of information collected from students and Outside School Child Users, including for educational and other learning activities at home through certain
premium features
that may be purchased, ("Premium Features").
Data Retention
: Retention and deletion of Student Data and education records is at the direction of the school.  We enter into
Student Data Privacy Addendums
with schools or districts that further describe our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to Student Data that we collect or receive. In addition, we will not retain student
personal information
for any longer than is necessary for
educational purposes
and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information. We protect students with our industry-leading Student Data Protection Policy: we automatically delete (or
de-identify
and aggregate) their
Feedback Points
awarded in the classroom or school after a year and delete associated feedback comments after a year), and we delete
Students' Accounts
if they're
inactive
for more than twelve months. Some content within a student account utilized in school or for
educational purposes
connected to a school or classroom ("Student Account") will be kept after deletion of the account for school compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of "education records" under the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
or
"Student Data"
under state student privacy laws or equivalent laws in international jurisdictions) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school. This can include content uploaded by a child or student, teacher, school leader, or parent.
For Outside School Child Users, personal information associated with their Outside School Child User’s account (“Outside School Child Account”) will be kept until the account is
deleted
or until we no longer need the information  to provide the Service, whichever occurs first. Additionally, some information  is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time.
What Children's Information is Shown Publicly?
No Student's Account, or Outside School Child Account, profile, or
Portfolio
is made available or visible to the general public through ClassDojo. For a list of what logged-in student users and Outside School Child Users information can be viewed by other logged-in ClassDojo users, please see our
FAQ
. In addition, please see our FAQ for Dojo Islands for details on the limited non-personal information of Outside School Child Users that can be viewed by Home Island Guest Users (as defined below) that play Dojo Islands without logging in.
We Never Sell Personal Information:
We will never
sell
or rent your student or Outside School Child User’s
personal information
or non-personal information. We will only disclose personal information as set forth in the Services Privacy Policy (including the below Children’s Privacy Policy), such as with a limited set of
third-party service providers
necessary to provide or develop our Services (such as database hosting) or as required by law, and we will be transparent about who these service providers are.
We will contractually require that these service providers process personal information in accordance with our instructions and consistent with this Children’s Privacy Policy. We ensure that these service providers employ reasonable and comprehensive data protection and security protocols. See
here
for more details.
We make clear commitments, consistent with our obligations under the
Student Privacy Pledge
, regarding how we handle student data in the event of a change to our organization (such as a merger) where
personal information
that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred or acquired. Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, our Privacy Policy and the below Children’s Privacy Policy, will continue to apply to your student or Outside School Child User’s information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per these policies (unless you give consent to a new policy). Please see
here
for more details.
We never use student or children's information for behaviorally targeted or third-party advertising:
Information collected from students and
Outside School Child Users
(including
personal information
and information collected automatically from areas designed for children to access) is never used or disclosed for
third-party advertising
. We also do not place any third-party advertisements in student or Outside School Child User logged-in areas of the Service. Additionally, personal information collected from students and Outside School Child Users is never used for
behaviorally-targeted advertising
to students or Outside School Child Users by us or any third-party. We may present
contextually relevant
recommendations (which means not using student or Outside School Child User personal information) for educational content for either our own products (e.g., Premium Features) or third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to a student (e.g., our co-created content with
Yale University on Mindfulness
, and Heart of a Champion series) or an Outside School Child User.
You own your data:
We don't own any content or information you provide or we receive - you (parents or your child) will own your student or Outside School Child User’s content and information.
Security and Privacy by Design and Default:
We use security industry best practices to protect children's
personal information
, including using encryption and other security safeguards to protect children’s personal information. We design products with security and privacy in mind from day one. See
here
for more information as well as our
Security Overview
and
Privacy Center
.
Transparency and Choice:
We will be transparent about our practices so that you can make meaningful choices about how your student or
Outside School Child User’s
personal information
is used. If we make a material change, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on our Service or this website page and/or we will notify you by email (if you have provided an email address to us). See
here
for more information.
Right to Access, Correction, and Deletion of Data:
We support access to, correction, and deletion of children's
personal information
by the student/Outside School Child User or their parent or legal guardian, either by 1) assisting the school in meeting its requirements for access, correction, and deletion or by responding to requests we receive from schools, or 2) directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians when the information is collected from an
Outside School Child User
, and ClassDojo obtains the
consent
directly from the parent or legal guardian. Where we are directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians, the school would not be
acting as the agent
of the parent and consenting - such as when the parent is using our Premium Features or uses ClassDojo not connected to a school.
You can contact us
here
once you are signed in to your account to submit a request to access, correct, or update your student or Outside School Child User’s personal information, or your child can use the features in their account settings to do so. See
here
for more information on your or your child’s rights, including about any additional rights you or your child may have depending on the jurisdiction you reside in.
How does ClassDojo Protect Children's Personal Information?
Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us - we’re educators and parents ourselves after all. This is why ClassDojo participates in the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program. iKeepSafe has granted ClassDojo the COPPA Safe Harbor seal signifying its Website, Platform, and Apps have been reviewed and approved for having policies and practices surrounding the collection, use, maintenance and disclosure of
personal information
from children are consistent with the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor program guidelines.
ClassDojo also holds the iKeepSafe FERPA Certification. This means that our Website, Platform, and Apps have been reviewed and approved for having policies and practices that help schools meet their FERPA obligations and are compliant with the federal mandates for the requirements for entities deemed to be “school officials” under FERPA.
ClassDojo is also a signatory to the Student Privacy Pledge. We agree to a set of principles intended to safeguard student privacy, including responsible stewardship, protection, and transparent handling of student personal information. Read more about the Student Privacy Pledge
here
.
For more information about COPPA and generally protecting children’s online privacy, please visit
OnGuard Online
.
We’ve also made a
short video
for children that highlights the most important details in our Children’s Privacy Policy that they should know about. We also have a
Student Data Privacy Addendum
, an agreement we enter into with schools, that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to
Student Data
that we collect or receive.
This Children’s Privacy Policy explains our information, collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children, and uses terms that are defined in our general Services Privacy Policy. For our full Services Privacy Policy please see
here
.  Any terms not defined in this Children’s Privacy Policy are defined in the Services Privacy Policy. This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and its implementing regulations under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (collectively “COPPA”).
ClassDojo extends the U.S-based COPPA consent protections in all jurisdictions, even if not required. If we rely on other legally applicable grounds for processing children’s personal information (e.g. if we rely on legitimate interest in the European Union and the United Kingdom when acting as a
Controller
), we will still use the FTC COPPA consent methods described to provide further transparency for parents.
Basically,
ClassDojo is certified
COPPA-compliant
, has a certification stating that its policies and practices help schools meet their FERPA obligations, and has also signed the
Student Privacy Pledge
. ClassDojo extends the U.S.-based COPPA consent protections to all jurisdictions, even if not required.
What information does ClassDojo collect from Children?
We collect two types of information from children: (1) information collected from children, including information that children voluntarily provide us by using the Services (described below under “Information Children Provide to Us”) and information about children from their educator or parent as described below under the “Information Collected About the Child from Educators and Parents Combined with Children’s Data” section; and (2) information collected automatically as result of children’s use of the Services (described below under “Information We Collect Automatically”).
The statements we make regarding the information we collect from or about students and children using ClassDojo through a
Student Account
or an
Outside School Child Account
, such as those using our
Premium Features
or
Home Islands
at home who are not connected to a school, and how we use this information applies equally to all students and
Outside School Child Users
regardless of their age. Accordingly, where this Privacy Policy references students or Outside School Child Users or any information collected from or about students or Outside School Child Users, it applies to students and Outside School Child users under 13 years old and over 13 years old. Please note, however, that for Outside School Child Users, we have different data retention policies as this information would not be retained beyond account deletion as may be required under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or other state student privacy laws (or equivalent laws in international jurisdictions) for “education records” or
“
Student Data
”
.
Information Collected From Children
ClassDojo collects the minimum amount of information from students and
Outside School Child Users
necessary to register for an account on the Service. Additionally, ClassDojo will not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the Service on the child providing more
personal information
than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Service.  If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information or immediately seek the
parent's consent
for that collection. This information is necessary to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service and for security and safety purposes.
For more detail on the categories of
personal information
collected from students and
Outside School Child Users
, as well as the sources from which the information was collected, the purposes for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we disclose such personal information for a business purpose, please see our
Information Transparency chart
In addition, please see our
Mobile App Permissions chart
for more detail on our mobile app permissions.
We collect information from children in the following ways:
Student Accounts
Student Account Creation
Currently,
Student Accounts
are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent; (2) by the student’s teacher; or (3) by the student themselves.
(1) By the parent:
When a parent sets up a
Student Account
for their child, they will first need to
create a parent account
and
connect to their child
. In accordance with COPPA, we may ask the parent to provide the date of birth or age of their child, and if the child is under 13, we will also then seek to obtain
parental consent
in order to proceed with creating their child’s
Student Account
. If a parent connected to their child through an invitation from their child’s school, we don’t ask the child’s parent for any additional information regarding their child during the
Student Account
creation but link the account to the name and information provided by the child’s teacher. The parent may choose to provide additional information such as their child’s date of birth. Once the child is connected to a school, the parent may also access the
Student Account
through the
student login methods
. A parent may also set up an
Outside School Child Account
as noted below.
(2) By the student’s teacher:
If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize
Student Accounts
in school or otherwise sets up a student’s account, the school will be responsible for providing
parental consent
under COPPA. Teachers may provide parental consent through what is commonly referred to as “school consent” under COPPA, where teachers have certified that they are acting as the agent of the parent and consenting on the parent’s behalf to create the
Student Account
on behalf of the student and let students use the Service for
educational purposes
.  For clarity, while it is ClassDojo’s obligation to comply with COPPA as a whole, we rely on schools to provide consent under COPPA by acting as the agent of the parent, but only after providing the school with the required notices set forth
here
. For more information on "school consent" under COPPA, please see the
FTC's FAQ Section N
as well as the FTC’s
Policy Statement on Education Technology and COPPA.
The teacher will provide the student’s name to set up the account, and possibly the student’s date of birth, or if the school or district is using an integrated Student Information System (“SIS”) this information will be collected directly from the school or district through such SIS as allowed by that district or school. Additionally, this information may also be provided to ClassDojo through a third-party
service provider
(e.g. Edlink) collecting this information directly from the district or school through the district’s SIS as instructed and allowed by that district.  After doing so, if the teacher is creating the Student’s Account, the teacher will be able to share a
student login method
. Additionally, teachers may choose to allow students to log in on the Service using their Google for Education or other Google Accounts (“Google Login(s)”). Please see
here
for more information on Google Login. We don’t ask students to enter any other
personal information
for their account registration when a teacher sets up their account.
(3) By the student:
Alternatively, a teacher may choose to allow students to set up their own
Student Account
. When students set up their own Student Account, we may ask students to provide a unique username, or their email, and a password. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if the student has not yet received the unique student code from their teacher to enable them access to their classroom, we may also ask for the child’s age or date of birth, and will ask for a parent or guardian email address or mobile telephone number from the child so we can seek verifiable
parental consent
or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails or mobile telephone numbers provided this way to market our Service to the parent or for any other purpose unless the parent has opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. Additionally, we will delete the parent email or mobile telephone number if the parent does not provide consent. If a teacher has provided the student with a unique student code prior to setting up their Student Account, then the student will enter this during account set up and the school will be responsible for providing
parental consent
under COPPA as set forth above.
We don’t ask students to enter any other
personal information
when setting up a Student Account.
Any
Student Account
(or access to a Student Account) created for the student by the parent, or the student’s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts). Additionally, any
Outside School Child Account
will also be linked with the
Student Account
(if both exist), but only certain content will be viewable by the child’s teacher and only certain limited
Student Data
linked or shared between the two accounts. Please see our ”Sharing Student Data For Non-School Use” section below as well as our
FAQ
for more details.
Student User Content - Photos, Videos, Documents, Drawings, Student Activity Responses, and Journal Entries in Student Accounts
Once a
Student Account
is created (whether created by the student’s teacher or parent or the student themself) and
parental consent
is obtained (including through
school consent
), students will be able to post in their Student Accounts. This includes responding to teacher
Activities
with
Student Activity Responses
or
adding items
(such as photos, videos including voice and audio information, written notes, and uploaded files or documents) to their ClassDojo Portfolio- which will be collected by ClassDojo once the content has been actively saved by the child within the Service. Until the content is actively saved by the child, it is temporarily stored locally on the child’s device. The student’s teacher must
approve
the post made by students in their Student Account on their
Portfolios
, including any
Student Activity Responses
, before it is shared with parents on Portfolios. Once a post has been approved by the teacher, any subsequent comments or replies to that post by the student will be added without approval by the teacher and also become visible to the parent.
Any content uploaded by a student in their
Student Account
in the classroom by their teacher, parent, or themselves, or by the child or parent in their
Outside School Child Account
, will appear visible in both accounts. However, certain content uploaded in the Outside School Child’s Account will not be viewable by the teacher in the Student Account. Please see our
FAQ
for more details.
Portfolio Comments in Student Accounts
If a student’s teacher has elected to provide
Portfolio Comments
on their
Student Activity Responses
or on any other content uploaded by students to Portfolios, the student may also respond to these comments. The student's teacher must approve the post made by students through their Student Account, before it is shared with parents on the student's portfolio. Prior to the approval of portfolio content by the child’s teacher, any
Portfolio Comments
between the teacher and the student can’t be viewed by the student’s parent, but any connected parents will
receive a notice
indicating that Portfolio Comments is being utilized by their child’s teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child’s teacher. Once the
Student Activity Responses
(or other content) have been approved by the student’s teacher, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable by the parent (but may have been previously edited by the student’s teacher). Parents are able to view their own child's portfolio (through their own parent account) after the teacher has approved the student-submitted content as mentioned above, including
Student Activity Responses
. Parents will then also be able to view any content uploaded by their child, or their child’s teacher. Please note that parents may not see prior drafts of the student-submitted content or Portfolio Comments prior to the final teacher approval that allows parents to access and view and may not see all Feedback Points awarded by the teacher in school if the teacher has elected not to show these.  Please also note that additional Portfolio Comments on a previously approved portfolio post are not first approved by the student’s teacher before being posted on the student’s portfolio.
Viewing and Commenting on Stories through Student Accounts
Students with Student Accounts may also view or “like” content on the Class Story and
provide comments
, however, they will not be able to post content (such as videos or photos) to either the Class Story or School Story. Currently, students are limited to posting content to just their own portfolio or through access to the Premium Features given to them by their parents. Teachers have the ability to
turn off the commenting feature
for students as well and can delete any individual user comment. Parents can also
be notified
when their child posts a comment in a Class Story or School Story. If any user needs to
report any abuse
or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at
safety@classdojo.com
.
Class Islands
As part of the Services, students have the ability to visit a virtual world with their ClassDojo monster with their
Student Account
where they can engage in various activities (e.g. explore, build, and play certain games) and interact with other children (including their classmates of the same grade level) inside of the classroom (
“Class Islands”
). Please see
here
for more details on what other children may see about the child while in
Class Islands
and how children can interact with each other.  When a child engages with Class Island, we will collect activity and progress information, including the child’s monster avatar, the monster parts or other virtual items unlocked or acquired, levels completed, building activities or other accomplishments, ClassDojo’s fictional currency earned or spent, and social connections (e.g. their classmates ). ClassDojo may also collect the contents of communications between children - such as messaging within the
Class Islands
that may include pre-canned chat messages.  ClassDojo may notify and share information about these reports with parents if follow-up is necessary based on the information collected.  A teacher may disable access to Class Islands for their students at any time.
Location Information
We never request precise geolocation data from students and no student location data is available publicly. From students, the primary form of location data is based on IP Addresses. If students upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone's camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo’s own application camera, we collect what the device sends us. If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file - e.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data). We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the parent in Portfolios). If a student accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if a parent uses their device’s own camera roll).
Outside School Accounts
Outside School Child Account Creation
Currently,
Outside School Child Accounts
are created in the following ways: (1) by the Outside School Child User’s parent; or (2) by the child or Outside School Child User  themselves.
By Parents:
Parents can set up their parent account without connecting to their child’s class, but will not be connected to their child’s school (or any activity on their child’s account in school (e.g. the
Student Account
)). If the parent is not connected to their child’s school, the parent must provide their child’s name (last name is at the option of the parent) and can create the
Outside School Child Account
. Once we have obtained
parental consent
, the child’s
Outside School Child Account
will be set up and accessible by
toggling from the parent account
.  If a child is connected to a school, the parent can also elect to have the child's information obtained in connection with the child’s
Student Account
used to fill in the child's name for the
Outside School Child Account
creation and has consented to the sharing of this
Student Data
for the Outside School Child Account.
By the Child:
An Outside School Child User may also set up their own Outside School Child Account.  We may ask the Outside School Child User to provide a unique username, or their email, and a password. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we may also ask for the child’s age or date of birth, and will ask for a parent or guardian email address or mobile telephone numbers from the child so we can seek verifiable
parental consent
or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails or mobile telephone numbers provided this way to market our Service to the parent or for any other purpose unless the parent has opted in to email or SMS marketing or has separately created an account on our Service and we will delete the parent email or mobile telephone number if the parent does not provide consent within a reasonable time from the date the direct notice was sent to the parent.
We don’t ask Outside School Child Users to enter any other
personal information
when setting up an Outside School Child User Account.
Any content uploaded by a child or parent in their
Outside School Child Account
, will appear visible in both the Outside School Account and Student Account. However, certain content uploaded in the Outside School Child’s Account will not be viewable by the teacher in the Student Account. Please see our
FAQ
for more details. Additionally, any
Outside School Child Account
will also be linked with the
Student Account
(if both exist), but only certain limited
Student Data
linked or shared between the two accounts. Please see our ”Sharing Student Data For Non-School Use” section below as well as our
FAQ
for more details.
Premium Features (Student Accounts and Outside School Child Account)
Parents may choose to allow their children to access and use certain
Premium Features
within the child’s
Student Account
or their
Outside School Child’s Account
. A parent will first need to have their own parent account and be required to use either their Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method, to purchase the Premium Features. If a parent is purchasing Premium Features from within their child’s Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account on their mobile device, they will also need to go through a “
parental gate
” prior to purchasing. Prior to allowing a child (or children) access to their
Student Account
or
Outside School Child’s Account
in order to access the Premium Features, we will also require
parental consent
. Once we have obtained parental consent, the children’s features will be unlocked for their children to utilize within their Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account. Although not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students or children 13 and above at our discretion. Parents may provide Home Points and additional content about their child as set forth below under the "Premium Features and Home Points" section below.
In addition, the child can customize their monster with additional monster parts available with Premium Features and these changes to their monster may be shown in their Student Account in class.
Home Islands
If a child’s parent has given
parental consent
, their child, using their
Outside School Child Account
, may visit a virtual world with their ClassDojo monster where they can engage in various activities (e.g. explore, build, and play certain games) and interact with other children (including their classmates and schoolmates) outside of the classroom (
“Home Island”
).  Parents may turn off the ability for their child to play in Home Islands. When a parent turns off the ability for their child to play on Home Islands, this will not turn off the ability for the child to play on the Class Island in school. Please see
here
, for more details on what other children may see about the child while in
Home Island
and how children can interact with each other.  When a child engages with Home Island, we will collect activity information, including the child’s monster avatar, the monster parts unlocked, levels completed, building activities or other accomplishments, ClassDojo’s fictional currency earned or spent, and social connections (e.g. their classmates or schoolmates of the same grade level). ClassDojo may also collect the contents of communications between children - such as messaging within
Home Islands
.
Guest child users that do not otherwise have a ClassDojo account in connection with either home or school use may also be invited by a current Home Island child user (e.g. via a QR Code) to enter Home Island (“Home Island Guest Users”). Home Island Guest Users will have limited functionality and ClassDojo will either (1) not collect any
personal information
from such Home Island Guest Users or (2) only collect limited device or other persistent identifiers (e.g. IP address ) that may be considered personal information (and not further collect any other personal information of the Home Island Guest User) solely for providing support for the internal operations (as that term is defined under
COPPA
) of Home Island (e.g. to authenticate the Home Island Guest User). Please see
here
for details on the limited non-personal information of Outside School Child Users that can be viewed by Home Island Guest Users that play Dojo Islands without logging in. ClassDojo will ensure that such persistent identifiers are not used for unauthorized purposes outside of support for the internal operations (as that term is defined under COPPA) through training, data access and, data segregation and storage.
Dojo Sparks
If a child’s parent has given
parental consent
, their child, using their
Outside School Child Account
, may use our “learn to read” features (“Dojo Sparks”) using speech recognition.  ClassDojo may collect and process your child’s voice recording from your child’s device microphone (e.g. through an iPad or Chromebook) in order to provide our automated speech recognition (“ASR”) services. We may then send this audio recording and
de-identified
identifiers to a third-party
service provider
for ASR processing; the service provider will then provide back the ASR analysis and related metadata.  This data (voice recording and ASR analysis) will be retained only transiently for processing by our third-party
service providers
, and then deleted.  ClassDojo will separately retain the voice recordings for a limited time period as well as the ASR analysis performed by the service provider as set forth
here
.  We further limit the use of the ASR data by the third-party service provider to provide the ASR service to ClassDojo for your child and would not allow this service provider to use this ASR data to improve their product or train ASR models.
Location Information
We never request precise geolocation data from
Outside School Child Users
and no  Outside School Child User location data is available publicly. From Outside School Child Users, the primary form of location data is based on IP Addresses. If
Outside School Child Users
upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone's camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo’s own application camera, we collect what the device sends us. If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file - e.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data). We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the parent in Portfolios). If an
Outside School Child User
accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if a parent uses their device’s own camera roll).
Conduct and Safety Information
ClassDojo may review and collect certain data when a child uses the
Dojo Islands
in-game
report feature
to flag inappropriate content. This data may include the reporter’s User ID, timestamp, Island type (Class or Home Island) and Island ID, relevant class or school information (such as class name, teacher’s email, and school verification status), a screenshot of the reported content, and details of other users present on the island at the time of the report. This information is used to assess and address offensive content, and to keep the platform safe and secure. ClassDojo may notify and share this information with parents if follow-up is necessary based on the information collected.
User Testing
We may conduct Zoom-recorded playtests and interviews to gather insights on new ClassDojo features like Dojo Islands. To that end, we may collect minimal information from children needed for the tests, including device-specific information (as noted below), test session details (e.g., interaction data and feedback from participants), communication contents, general location, Zoom recordings, and related product and event logs.
Zoom
may also collect the following from the device: information about the speakers, microphone, camera, OS version, hard disk ID, PC name, MAC address, WiFi information, and other device information (like Bluetooth signals). Please see
Zoom’s Children’s Education Privacy Statement
for more information. We also collect from the parent their name and email, as well as the name of their child.
Parents must be present for these playtests and interviews, provide COPPA consent, and sign a separate participant release before testing. We use this user testing data for internal analytics to improve ClassDojo’s features.  We retain the data only as needed, and delete the recordings from Zoom after 14 days, but may retain the recordings on our servers (or elect to have Zoom retain these) for as long as necessary, but not indefinitely, to conduct the internal analysis or as allowed by law. The data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and shared only with necessary back-end service providers like Zoom.
Information Collected from Educators or Parents Combined with Children’s Data
While not collected directly from the child, teachers,
School Leaders
, authorized members of the school staff (“
Admins
”) and school district staff (“District Users”), and parents may provide the
personal information
set forth below about a child which we will link or combine with the information listed above that we collect from the child.
Teachers,
School Leaders
, Admins and District Users about students:
Demographic Information
: The child’s first and last name, date of birth, student grade, class name (or list of all class names), school name and location, and agents (connected students/family) may be provided by these users. This information may also be provided through an integrated SIS (or through a third-party
service provider
(e.g., Edlink) collecting this information directly from the district or school through the district's SIS) both as allowed and instructed by that district. In this scenario, if a district deletes a student from their roster, we promptly delete our corresponding roster record, but retain access to that student’s ClassDojo profile until the district disables SSO for that student.  Separately, teachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; they can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name and seat number).
Feedback Points:
Feedback Points
which may be given by the teacher,
School Leader
, or authorized
Admins
to the child (including both points awarded in the classroom or points awarded in school outside the classroom). These Feedback Points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s Feedback Points and any notes the teacher adds about the point, can only be viewed on ClassDojo as set forth below:
Classroom feedback points
: These points can be awarded to the child by the child’s teacher, and are viewable by the child, the child’s teacher (who awarded them), any connected parent accounts (if the teacher
has elected
to show them to the parent), and
School Leaders
. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual feedback points). We may also present aggregate summaries (e.g. of total percentage) of Feedback Points awarded by the teacher along with any photos from a Class Story or School Story to parents.
School-wide feedback points
: These points can be awarded by any
School Leader
, teacher, or
Admin
for activities outside of the classroom (such as responsibility, teamwork, respect, compassion). They can be viewed by the child, any connected parent accounts,
School Leaders
, and
Admins
. Other teachers may see these points in the process of awarding a point to a student.
Content on Portfolios,
Class Story and School Story
: Content (including photos and videos) added to the child’s portfolio or
Class Story or School Story
by the teacher, and any activities assigned by the teacher as well as comments or communications from the child’s teacher to the child on these activities may be collected. We combine Class and School Story posts (which may include the child’s name, class details, and photos) into a unified single feed for authorized
Admins
, including
School Leaders
. This consolidated information is used by
School Leaders
to enable more visibility into school activities, including to track, monitor and engage with school activities effectively.
School Leaders
can access all Story posts from individual classes and the entire school in chronological order. They can also like and comment on
Class or School Stories
, and view engagement details on each post, but currently can only add posts to School Stories, not Class Stories.  The child’s teacher may choose to select certain photos of the child previously posted on their Class Stories to be included in digital photo albums called
Dojo Photobooks
. We will send these selected photos as well as class details (e.g., class year, grade level) about the child to a
service provider
to create these
Dojo Photobooks
. These
Dojo Photobooks
may include photos of the child’s class activities, projects, or school events, and will be made available for any parent to print and purchase.
Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Classroom Tools and AI Productivity Tools
:  The child’s teacher may choose to provide text only (no video or photo) “inputs” (which may include
personal information
about the child, such as their name, class participation details, or homework responses) to the ClassDojo teacher
AI tools
used to assist the teacher within the classroom (“AI Classroom Tools”) to generate various school-related content or “outputs”, such as
Class Story
posts, messages, assessments, thank-you notes, and report card comments. For instance, the child’s teacher might use the child’s name and class participation details to draft an editable
Class Story
post about a recent project or field trip, or draft an editable thank-you note or editable report card commentary.  The content created through this process in connection with the AI Classroom Tools, including the AI-generated “outputs” will only be shared with the child’s parents, the child, and authorized teachers and
Admins
.  In addition, ClassDojo may provide certain AI features to assist teachers, School Leaders and Admins with certain non-classroom related use tasks (e.g. uploading rostering lists) (“AI Productivity Tools”). These users may choose to provide “inputs” that may contain text or photos/videos (e.g. a photo of a classlist of students) in connection with the use of these AI Productivity Tools.  For more information on the “input” from teachers, School Leaders, and Admins, and “prompts” (or instructions) submitted by ClassDojo and used to generate the AI “outputs”, as well as the information shared with our Large Language Model (“LLM”)
service providers
, please see our
AI Transparency Note
.
Parents about their child:
Demographic Information
: Additionally, if not previously provided by the child or their teacher, when creating the child’s
Student Account
or
Outside School Child Account
, parents may provide their child’s name and date of birth or age. We may pre-populate the child’s name when a parent uses their ClassDojo Services account to login to any existing
Dojo Tutor
account that the parent may have.  See the Dojo Tutor
Privacy Policy
for more details as well as the “Sharing of Student  xData for Non-School Use” section below.
Premium Features and Home Points
:  A parent may choose to allow their child to access and use certain
Premium Features
within the child’s
Student Account
or their
Outside School Child's Account
.  A parent can award and customize
Home Points
as well as
Rewards
to a child for educational and other learning activities completed at home not in connection with school use (e.g. the child cleaning their room). Additionally, parents can give a
Home Point
when they see that the child has received a
Feedback Point
from school to celebrate them ("Applause"). The Home Points may be combined with the
Feedback Points
earned in school for a combined point total. All points (
Home Points
or
Feedback Points
in school) are collected by ClassDojo and may be used by ClassDojo to provide the Service, including providing certain
Premium Features
(e.g. enhanced reports), sending
push notifications
or other
in-app notifications
to the child and for internal analytics on product usage. For all points (
Home Points
or
Feedback Points
in school) and the reports generated that show these points, we also collect product events (e.g., the number of points given, skill, which reports are viewed, etc.). The content related to
Home Points
, and
Rewards
, is viewable by the connected parent account(s) and the child using their
Student Account
or
Outside School Child Account
and are not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students. This content can be deleted by the parent.
Content on
Portfolios
,
Class Story and School Story
:
Content (including photos and videos) parents add of their child or about their child to the child’s portfolio or
Class Story or School Story
or any comments mentioning the child on
Portfolios
,
Class Story or School Story
.  Parents may choose to select certain photos previously posted on their child’s
Class Stories
to be included in digital photo albums called
Dojo Photobooks
. We will send these selected photos as well as class details (e.g., class year, grade level) about the child to a service provider to create these
Dojo Photobooks
.
Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Parent Tools
: The child’s parent may choose to provide “inputs” (which may include
personal information
about their child, such as their name, interests, or homework responses) and “prompts” (e.g. instructions) to the ClassDojo parent AI tools to help with ideas and activities at home (“Parent AI Tools”). For instance, a coloring page could be generated based on what the parent inputs about the child’s interests. The content created through this process, including the AI-generated “outputs” will only be shared with the child’s connected parents.  For more information on the “input” and “prompts” used to generate the AI “outputs” on the Parent AI Tools, as well as the information shared with our Large Language Model (“LLM”)
service providers
, please see our
AI Transparency Note
.
Information We Collect Automatically
In addition to the information listed above, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service (in both Student Account and Outside School Child Account areas) as set forth below.
The device and application related data is collected from the device and application being utilized to give the child access to ClassDojo accounts (e.g., the parents device if the child is utilizing the parent’s device, or the child’s device if they are logging in separately on their own device).
This includes:
Cookies and other similar technologies
: We may use first party
cookies or similar technologies
to identify the child’s browser or device. We will never use third-party technologies in Student or Outside School Child User logged in areas of our Service in connection with advertising of our Service or other third-party services. We don't allow third parties to advertise directly on our Service.  Please read our
Online Tracking Technologies Policy
for more details on our first party cookies used in connection with Student and Outside School Child Users, including how to modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.
[Local storage]
(https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_efdb3ae6-8829-4e77-a8e0-b47c865fbe1b): We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your child’s device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage (including HTTP cookies and HTML5) and application data caches.
Like many services, ClassDojo (or our service providers) uses local storage,
cookies or similar technologies
to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our users, understand user engagement with the Service, administer the Service, tailor the Service for users, and to help the Service work better for users -–for example, by remembering your child’s language preferences or other information so that your child will not have to re-enter it during the next time you visit the Services.
Device information:
We collect device-specific information such as your child’s device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version and settings, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, device tokens (to send push notifications) and device identifiers (including unique device IDs). We may also collect device event information such as crashes, system activity, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your child’s request and referral URL. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for your child on their particular device, and send push notifications if you've opted in to receive them.
Mobile application information:
The number and information about your child’s installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when your child installs or uninstalls that application, such as when your child installs the ClassDojo App, when your child opens the application, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help us debug and improve the ClassDojo App.
Server log information:
Like most online services, when your child uses our Service we automatically collect and store certain information in our
server logs
. Examples include things like:
IP address
Details of how you used our Service, such as your activity on the Service
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, and to manage the Service. Third party sharing of
IP address
information for analytics and advertising is not allowed for Student and Outside School Child Users. We automatically delete IP addresses tracked in server logs after six months.
Cross-device collection:
To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your child’s identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using, such as with our syncing technology,
DojoCast
.
Product events:
As children interact with the product, we collect product events, including from the child’s device, about how the product is being used,  which features are used, which buttons are clicked, load time, etc. These include events such as the last activity a child started (e.g. fictional virtual currency earned for completing an adventure in Dojo Island), number of
Home Points
or
Feedback Points
given, whether the child viewed a certain report from their device, such as for Premium Features,
Dojo Island
events, or whether they logged in via QR code to their Student Account on the parent's device). These are collected to provide the Services, including for internal analysis on product usage and quality. We may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending
push
or email notifications to the child (as set forth below)  to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service. Our product event logs may also include unique device IDs and
IP addresses
. We automatically delete IP addresses tracked in product logs after six months.
Online Status:
We collect whether you are online or not, with the purpose of sharing this with other children you play Dojo Islands with.
Basically,
We don’t ask for or require children to provide
personal information
beyond that which is reasonably necessary to use ClassDojo. Please see
this chart
for the detailed categories of information we collect from each user type and how we use the information, as well as the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we disclose personal information for a business purpose.
How does ClassDojo use information it collects from Children?
First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo does not
sell
or rent any of your child’s
personal information
to any third party for any purpose – including for advertising or marketing purposes. Information collected from students and
Outside School Child Users
(including
personal information
and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for
third-party advertising
. We also do not place any third-party advertisements in student or Outside School Child User logged in areas of the Service. Additionally, personal information collected from students and Outside School Child Users is never used for
behaviorally-targeted advertising
to students or Outside School Child Users by us or any third-party.
We may present
contextually relevant recommendations
(which means not using student or Outside School Child User
personal information
) for educational content for either our own products (e.g., Premium Features) or third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to a student (e.g., our co-created content with
Yale University on Mindfulness
, and Heart of a Champion series) or an Outside School Child User.
We also offer a
Student Data Privacy Addendum
, an agreement we enter into with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to
Student Data
that we collect or receive and may further limit our uses of Student Data from the uses set forth in the Children’s Privacy Policy. When acting as a Controller of data about
Outside School Child Users
, we process this information given our legitimate interest in providing the Service.
ClassDojo commits that its collection, use, retention, and sharing of
personal information
shall be reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the personal information was collected or processed and for the purposes disclosed in this Children’s Privacy Policy and
Information Transparency Chart
and that the
personal information
will not be further processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes.
Our uses of your child’s personal information are set forth below:
Non-AI Uses

AI Uses
School Use
ClassDojo uses AI Classroom Tools to help teachers generate teaching-related editable content, such as Story posts, messages, report card comments or assessments.   Additionally, ClassDojo uses AI Productivity Tools to better assist teachers, School Leaders and Admins with certain non-classroom related tasks such as uploading rostering lists.  Data obtained from the inputs, prompts and outputs used in connection with these various AI tools may be accessed, processed and used by ClassDojo to provide, improve and maintain the Service, perform internal analysis (including to provide metrics and data logs or activity records needed for measuring up/down time and, debugging the tools), and keep the ClassDojo platform safe and secure. To understand more about the specific “prompts” used to generate these AI insights, the information shared with the LLM Service Providers (as defined below), and ClassDojo’s use of AI, please see our
AI Transparency Note
.
Outside School Use
Parents can also use our AI technology tools to help them provide enriching educational experiences at home (“Parent AI Tools”). For instance, a coloring page could be generated based on what the parent inputs about the child’s interests. Or suggestions for how to explain a specific type of homework problem. Data obtained from the inputs, prompts and outputs used in connection with these various AI tools may be accessed, processed and used by ClassDojo to provide, improve and maintain the Service, perform internal analysis (including to provide metrics and data logs or activity records needed for measuring up/down time and, debugging the tools), and keep the ClassDojo platform safe and secure. For more information on the “input” and “prompts” used to generate the AI “outputs”, as well as the information shared with our Large Language Model (“LLM”)
service providers
, please see our
AI Transparency Note
.
For all of the various AI tools (both in school and out of school) we are currently using OpenAI and Anthropic as our LLM service providers (“LLM Service Providers”). Children's’ data used to provide the “inputs” (e.g., name, school, role, etc.) may be transiently retained by the LLM Service Providers to provide the Service to ClassDojo. ClassDojo has entered into a specific contract with the LLM Service Providers for “zero data retention” beyond this transient retention for the ClassDojo-provided AI tools mentioned above. This means that the prompts, inputs, and outputs (1) will not be logged for human review by the LLM Service Providers and (2) will not be retained by the LLM Service Provider. Note, however, that the LLM Service may perform automated screening of the inputs and prompts for safety purposes (the “Safety Classifiers”), which shall consist solely of metadata (including classifier types, dates, counts, and confidence scores) and shall not include any inputs, prompts, or outputs themselves (including summarizations of prompts, inputs, or outputs) or any portion thereof. LLM Service Providers may retain data from Safety Classifiers.
ClassDojo does not use any children’s
personal information
contained in any inputs, prompts, or output to train any of ClassDojo’s artificial intelligence models, but does reserve the right to use
de-identified information
. Additionally, ClassDojo does not allow OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other LLM or AI third-party
service provider
it may utilize to use any children’s information (personal information or de-identified) to train, improve or develop their artificial intelligence models. This commitment includes the information contained in the chart detailed in the
AI Transparency Note
, such as the teacher provided inputs, used to produce the AI outputs. For more information about our retention periods for this information, please see this
chart
.
Basically,
Information collected from students or Outside School Child Users is
never
used or disclosed for
third-party advertising
or any kind of
behaviorally-targeted advertising
, and it is
never
sold
or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers. Please see
this chart
for the detailed categories of information we collect from each user type and how we use the information, as well as the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.
ClassDojo provides AI Classroom Tools and AI Productivity Tools, including to help teachers generate teaching-related content for Class Story posts, messages, assessments, thank-you notes, and report card comments. ClassDojo also provides Parent AI Tools to help parents provide enriching educational experiences at home. Data obtained from the inputs, prompts and outputs used in connection with these various AI tools may be accessed, processed and used by ClassDojo to provide, improve and maintain the Service), perform internal analysis (including to provide metrics and data logs or activity records needed for measuring up/down time and, debugging the tools), and keep the ClassDojo platform safe and secure. For more information, please see our
AI Transparency Note

Push Notifications
ClassDojo may send
push notifications
to students or
Outside School Child Users
. Before sending a push notification to a child, if the child or the parent sets up the child’s account on the Service, we provide notice to the parents, or obtain
parental consent
.  We will then provide the parent with notice (if the account was set up by them or their child) that the push notifications are being sent to their child. The device identifier for a child’s account will only be associated with other
personal information
once parental consent is provided. We rely on teachers to provide any necessary
parental consent
(e.g. acting as the agent of the parent and consenting on their behalf) if they set up the child’s Student Account and the push notifications are related to school or classroom use. These push notifications may contain information about taking an action in the Service, such as the child completing a task or other product feature, or informing the child their parent has purchased additional monster parts for them. If you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer want these communications to be sent, please either turn off the push notifications on your device or contact us at
privacy@classdojo.com
.
Basically,
Before ever sending a push notification to a child, if the child or the parent sets up the child’s account on the Service, we will provide notice to parents, or obtain
parental consent
. We rely on teachers to provide  any necessary
parental consent
if they set up the child’s Student Account and the push notifications are related to school or classroom use. Parents can always opt-out (or withdraw consent) later as well by turning off the push notifications on their child’s device or contacting us at
privacy@classdojo.com
.
Does ClassDojo disclose any information it collects from Children?
We do not disclose any
personal information
about children to third parties, except to
service providers
(e.g. AWS) necessary to provide the Service, authorized school personnel (such as teachers,
School Leaders
and
Admins
), as directed by the child's school, or as directed or approved by the child’s parents or legal guardians (such as through
Home Island
), as required by
law
, or to protect the security of the Service or other users.  You can visit our
service providers
page to see the list and categories of third-party operators collecting or maintaining personal information from children through the Service, the purpose of such disclosure, as well as an indication on whether these service providers are integral to the Service. You may choose to agree to the collection and use of your child’s personal information, but choose not to allow disclosure to certain third parties (unless such disclosure is integral to the Service). For any non-integral third party disclosures, we will provide a separate consent box.  Please contact us as set forth in the section “
How Can I Contact ClassDojo with Questions
” with questions about the operators’ privacy policies and collection and use practices. Additionally, at any time, you may also agree to the collection and use of your child’s personal information, but choose not to allow disclosure to certain third parties (unless disclosure is integral to the Service). For additional information on the limited other circumstances in which we disclose children’s personal information, please see the “
Will ClassDojo Share any Information it Collects
” Section in the Services Privacy Policy.
As allowed by applicable laws and in compliance with our
Student Data Privacy Addendum
, we may share aggregated or
de-identified
information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify your child, with third parties for various purposes, including compliance with various reporting obligations, demonstrating how the Service is used or assisting third parties in understanding our users’ interest, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs.  If your school or district has entered into a custom
Student Data Privacy Addendum
, any additional restrictions on the disclosure of
Student Data
or
de-identified
data will also be set forth there.

What Children's information is visible to others?
No
Student’s Account
, or
Outside School Child’s Account
, profile, or
Portfolio
is made available or visible to the general public through ClassDojo. ClassDojo does not knowingly post any child’s
personal information
publicly online unless the child’s teacher has explicitly chosen to do so (or allows the child to) on
Class Story or School Story
(under what is commonly known as “
school consent
” under COPPA).
For a list of what logged in student users’ and Outside School Child Users’ information can be viewed by other logged in ClassDojo users, please see our
FAQ
. In addition, please see our FAQ for Dojo Islands for details on the limited non-personal information of Outside School Child Users that can be viewed by Home Island Guest Users (as defined below) that play Dojo Islands without logging in.
School Use
For students using ClassDojo in the classroom (or at home in connection with school use), only the student, the student’s connected parent account(s) (which may include other adults the parent authorizes and invites), and the student’s teachers or
School Leaders
connected to the child’s class can see the student’s individual
Student Account
and
Portfolio
.  This includes
Feedback Points
(if the teacher has chosen to share them with the child’s parent),
Student Activity Responses
, and
Portfolio Comments
.  If a teacher displays their teacher account publicly in class, then students may see other students’ aggregated total
Feedback Points (but not individual feedback points)
.  This is similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in the classroom might work. Teachers, however, can choose never to project or display their own teacher account in class, and therefore keep student Feedback Points and Portfolios private for each student, their teacher(s), and their parents - and many do!
Children can only upload content (such as Student Activity Responses, photos, videos, journal entries, or documents) to a portfolio or otherwise (such as commenting on
Class Stories
) to the Service for school use through their
Student Account
. This can’t happen for children without either (1) the parent providing
parental consent
directly to ClassDojo; or (2) the child’s teacher representing to ClassDojo that they have provided
consent
through acting as the agent of the parent. Additionally, the student's teacher
must approve
the post made by students through their Student Account, before it is shared with parents on the student's portfolio. Once a post has been approved by the teacher, any subsequent comments or replies to that post by the student will be added without approval by the teacher and also become visible to the parent. Parents are able to view their own child's portfolio (through their own parent account) after the teacher has approved the student-submitted content as mentioned above, including Student Activity Responses. Parents will then also be able to view any content uploaded by their child, or their child’s teacher.  Please note that parents may not see prior drafts of the student-submitted content or Portfolio Comments prior to the final teacher approval that allows parents to access and view and may not see all
Feedback Points
awarded by the teacher in school if the teacher has elected not to show these.
If the child adds content to their
Student Account
in the classroom, other students can't view the child's individual
Student Account
or
Portfolio
unless those other students have intentionally chosen the child's name from the list of names shown to them while logging in, or viewed the camera roll locally on the device that the child used to save the photos and videos taken by them. Teachers have the option to use individual QR codes or links specific to each student for private and individual login purposes to prevent this.  However, other students in a child’s class may see the child’s avatar and name. Other logged-in students, parents (which may include other adults parents may authorize and invite), teachers,
School Leaders
and authorized
Admins
connected to the class or school can see likes, comments, the child’s avatar, and first name and last initial on
Class Story and School Story
posts as well as any content added by any user with access to these Stories.
The Stories are not visible to the general public.  Class Story and School Story are visible to students, teachers, parents (which may include other adults the parent authorizes and invites),
School Leaders
, and authorized
Admins
who have logged into their accounts and are associated with that particular class or school. Students can view or "like" content and comment on these Stories (but can't upload content such as photos or videos) and are only able to do this once either the school or ClassDojo has obtained
parental consent
, if under 13. Parents (which may include other adults the parent authorizes and invites), teachers, School Leaders, and Admins can add content or comments to these stories. All content added by any user may be seen by other logged-in users with access to these Stories, as well as the user's name (only first name and last initial for students) and their profile picture, if added (for teachers, School Leaders, Admins or parents), or their ClassDojo monster (for students) posted next to the comment or content.  Please note that comments posted by students on Stories are not pre-approved by the student’s teacher before being posted.  However, teachers must first choose to
turn on
the Story commenting feature for students.  In addition, teachers have the ability to turn off the Story commenting feature for parents  and can delete any individual user comment. If any user needs to
report any abuse
or inappropriate content on a
Class Story or School Story
that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at
safety@classdojo.com
.
If a student uses
Class Islands
in the classroom, other students in a child’s class may view the child's content and interact with the child as set forth
here
, but still can't view the child’s individual
Student Account
or
Portfolio
. Additionally, any customization of the child’s avatar or monster by the child within either their
Student Account
or
Outside School Child Account
or either
Dojo Island
(e.g., Home Island or Class Island) is viewable within both the child's
Outside School Child Account
and
Student Account
(and thus viewable by the child's teacher or other students in the classroom).   ClassDojo may notify and share information about these reports with parents if follow-up is necessary based on the information collected.   A teacher may disable access to Class Islands at any time.
Teachers may
share their classes
, including Feedback Points,
Portfolios
, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders connected to their school.
Outside School Use
Home Points,
Rewards
for
Skills
awarded within the
Outside School Child's Account
, content uploaded by children within their Outside School Child Account, or any Premium Features used outside of school are viewable by the parent and any children accessing such Premium Features outside of school within their respective accounts or those users that the parent
allows access
. The content is not viewable by the child's teacher or other students.
For
Outside School Child Users
, if a child is also utilizing certain features
approved by their parent
, such as our
Premium Features
, or
Home Islands
then other children and users may view content and interact with each other as set forth
here
. Additionally, the customization of the monster by the child within Premium Features or the
Home Island
may be viewable within the child's Student Account (and thus viewable by the child's teacher or other students in the classroom). In addition, please see our
FAQ
for Dojo Islands for details on the limited non-personal information of Outside School Child Users that can be viewed by Home Island Guest Users (as defined below) that play Dojo Islands without logging in.
Parents have the ability to choose to participate in
Family Chat
to communicate with other parents in the school. Unless a parent chooses to block someone or opt out of
Family Chat
, the parent’s name and their child’s first name and last initial will appear in the list of people others in the school can message. The same information will appear in the context of the message as well, so that others know who else is in the message and who sent which message.
Student Accounts:
Only the student, their connected parents and teachers or
School Leaders
can see the content in the
Student Account
, including
Feedback Points
(if the teacher has chosen to share them with parents),
Student Activity Responses
, and Portfolio Comments.  Other logged in students, parents, and teachers connected to the class or school can see likes, comments, the student's first name and last initial, and ClassDojo avatar on Class Story or School Story posts.  If a teacher displays their teacher account publicly in class, then students may see other students’ total Feedback Points, and potentially classwork on
Portfolios
. Students can upload content to their Portfolio through their
Student Account
, but teacher approval is required before parents can view it. Once approved, comments are automatically visible to parents. If Class Islands is enabled, other students can view and interact with the content but not access the child's individual
Student Account
or
Portfolio
. Avatar or monster customizations by the child are visible in both the
Student Account
and
Outside School Child’s Account
and can be viewed by the teacher and classmates.
Outside School Child Accounts and Family Chat:
Only the child and their connected parents or family members will see content uploaded not for school use, including Home Points, Rewards or Skills; the content is not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students. Other children may be able to interact and see some information as set forth
here
, if the child is using certain Premium Features or their Home Dojo Island after parental approval.  In addition, please see our FAQ for Dojo Islands for details on the limited non-personal information of Outside School Child Users that can be viewed by Home Island Guest Users (as defined below) that play Dojo Islands without logging in.Other parents in the school can also see the parent name and their child’s first name and last initial if the parent has not chosen to turn off Family Chat for themselves.
Basically,
No
Student’s Account
, or
Outside School Child’s Account
, profile, or
Portfolio
is made available or visible to the general public through ClassDojo.
How long does ClassDojo keep Children's information?
School Use
Retention and deletion of
Student Data
and
education records
is at the direction of the school.  We enter into
Student Data Privacy Addendums
with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to
Student Data
that we collect or receive.  There may be some content created by students that a parent, legal guardian or student may also elect to maintain when a school requests deletion - known as Student-Generated Content.  Please see our
FAQ
for details on how to request to maintain Student-Generated Content.
In addition, ClassDojo will not retain a child’s
personal information
for any longer than is reasonably necessary for
educational purposes
or legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the child’s
personal information
, including if a child’s parent directs us to retain certain content by electing to purchase our
Memories
or
Dojo Photobooks
features. Additionally, we only keep a child’s personal information for as long as his or her
Student Account
is
active
, unless we are required by law or the child’s school (for Student Accounts) to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms (which shall not include retaining indefinitely).
More specifically, ClassDojo operates a student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just users under 13) information (“Student Data Protection Policy”):
One year deletion policy for Feedback Points:
To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long students’
Feedback Points
and associated comments given in the classroom or school setting are retained. For all students, Feedback Points older than 12 months are automatically deleted (or
de-identified
and aggregated) and associated feedback comments are deleted after a year. This means Feedback Points cannot exist long-term. Teachers can delete Feedback Points at any time.
School Leaders
can also delete classroom feedback points at any time.  For more information on Home Points, please see our
FAQ
.
Deleting inactive Student Accounts:
If a student’s
Student Account
is
inactive
for 12 months or more (meaning no student has logged into their account for 12 months), ClassDojo will automatically delete the Student Account. Learn more about how we delete Student Accounts
here
. Please note that certain content (1) within a Student Account or student portfolio (uploaded by the student, teacher, or parent), such as photos, videos,
Student Activity Responses
or
Portfolio Comments
, or (2) uploaded by a teacher,
School Leader
, parent, or student through
Class Story or School Story
may be kept after deletion of a Student Account as we are required to retain these at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of “education records” under
FERPA
or “
Student Data
” under state student privacy laws or equivalent international laws). This content may also have been selected by the student’s parent to be retained by us through the parent’s purchase of our
Memories
or
Dojo Photobooks
features. Please see our
FAQ
about how to request deletion of this content.
Please see our
Information Transparency chart
and
AI Transparency Note
for more details on specific retention periods.
Outside School Use
ClassDojo will not retain an Outside School Child User’s
personal information
for any longer than is reasonably necessary to fulfill the specific purpose for which the information was collected, including to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the child’s
personal information
, including if a child’s parent directs us to retain certain content by electing to purchase our
Memories
or
Dojo Photobooks
features, or for  legal obligations.  Additionally, we only keep a child’s personal information for as long as his or her
Outside School Child Account
is
active
, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms (which still not include retaining indefinitely).
We determine the appropriate retention period for
personal information
on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information being processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information, whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitations). The time periods for which we retain children's personal information depend on the purposes for which we use it. Personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted or is
inactive
, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services, in which case we will delete prior to you deleting your account or your account becoming
inactive
.
For more information on the deletion of content related to our Premium Features or
Outside School Child Accounts
(and not school-based Student Accounts or content), please see our
FAQ
.  Please see our
Information Transparency chart
and
AI Transparency Note
for more details on specific retention periods.
For either Student Accounts or Outside School Child Accounts, even if you delete your account, keep in mind that the deletion by our
service providers
may not be immediate and the deleted information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time. We may retain
de-identified data
for as long as we deem appropriate or as otherwise allowed by law or as further limited by any school or district’s
Student Data Privacy Addendum
.
Basically,
We only keep a child’s
personal information
for as long as the account is
active
, unless we are required by law or the child’s school (for Student Accounts) to retain it, need it to enforce our policies or to ensure the security of our community. Additionally, we protect students with our industry-leading Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we automatically delete (or
de-identify
and aggregate) their
Feedback Points
given in the classroom after a year (and delete associated feedback comments), and (2) we delete Students’ Accounts if they’re
inactive
for more than twelve months. Please note that this does not include certain content uploaded by the teacher, parent, or student to the portfolio that may be considered an “education record” under FERPA or other state student privacy laws as we are required to retain these at the direction of the school. ClassDojo will also delete
inactive
Outside School Child Accounts.  We may retain
de-identified data
for as long as we deem appropriate or as otherwise allowed by law or as further limited by any school or district’s
Student Data Privacy Addendum
.
Parental Choices
At any time, you have the right to (with certain limitations when “
school consent
” is used):
Access, review and correct your child's information
Direct us to delete your child’s information
Refuse to permit us to collect further
personal information
from your child and request that we delete the
personal information
that we have already collected from your child
Agree to the collection and use of your child’s personal information, but choose not to allow disclosure to certain third parties (unless disclosure is integral to the Service)
Please keep in mind that a request to delete information or a refusal to permit disclosure of the information to third parties may affect your child’s ability to access the Services or use certain features. To exercise any of these rights, please see below.
Access, Correction, and Deletion Rights under COPPA
We support access to, correction, and deletion of children’s
personal information
by the student or their parent or legal guardian, either by (1) assisting the school in meeting its requirements for access, correction, and deletion or by responding to parent or legal guardian requests we receive from schools, or (2) directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians when the information is collected from an
Outside School Child User
, and ClassDojo obtains the
parent’s consent
directly (not school
acting as the agent
of the parent and consenting) - such as when they are using our Premium Features or use ClassDojo not connected to a school.
In addition to the choices provided to you as a parent under COPPA set forth below, you may also have certain other rights relating to your
personal information
, subject to local data protection laws and the jurisdiction you reside in. See the “
What are ClassDojo’s Commitments to Providing Transparency and Your Rights?
” Section in our Services Privacy Policy for more information on your rights.
Outside School Child Accounts
:  If your child’s
Outside School Child Account
was set up directly by your child, or you as their parent or legal guardian, set up their Outside School Child’s Account (either method only after we
parental consent
), or you allow your child access to Premium Features, and you have a parent account connected to your child, you may access, review, correct, or delete any of your child’s personal information in the Service by contacting us
here
once you are signed into your parent account.
When you delete your child’s account, we delete the content or personal information uploaded as set forth in our
FAQ
. Please note, however, that any content uploaded (e.g., photos, videos,
Student Activity Responses
,
Portfolio
Comments, Class Story Comments), that is requested as part of a
Student Account
(that might be linked to your child’s
Outside School Child Account
) class at a school, or otherwise directed by your child’s teacher or school, is retained at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of “education records” under FERPA or “
Student Data
” under various state student privacy laws or equivalent international jurisdictions). To correct or delete this content, please contact the appropriate official at your child’s school. If the school determines that the request should be implemented, the school may either make the change themselves or submit the request to ClassDojo by contacting us
here.
Student Accounts:
If your child’s school set up their
Student Account
directly and provided consent by acting as an agent and consenting on your behalf and you do not have a parent account connected to your child, please contact the appropriate official at your child’s school to access, review, correct or delete any of your child’s
personal information
in the Service. If the school determines that the request should be implemented, the school may either make the change themselves or submit the request to ClassDojo by contacting us
here
. A parent or legal guardian who has a ClassDojo parent account and is already connected to their child and who also provided
parental consent
directly to ClassDojo in addition to the school, may at any time contact ClassDojo directly by contacting us
here
once you are signed in to your parent account to access and review their child’s personal information in the Service, but correction or deletion requests should still be made to the child’s school first.
For either method described above, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner consistent with applicable law. We will need to verify your identity, for example by requiring that you provide acceptable forms of personal identification as set forth in our
FAQ
.
Stop Collecting Further Personal Information or Restrict Disclosure under COPPA
Additionally, at any time, for Outside School Children Accounts, or Premium Features, you can refuse to permit us to collect further
personal information
from your child by emailing
privacy@classdojo.com
from the same email used to create your parent account or by contacting us
here
and request that we delete the personal information that we have already collected from your child as set forth above. Please keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question.
Additionally, at any time, for Outside School Children Accounts you may also agree to the collection and use of your child’s personal information, but choose not to allow disclosure to certain third parties (unless disclosure is integral to the Service).
Basically,
We support parents’ access to, correction and deletion of their child’s
personal information
.  We do this by either working with schools or by directly responding to requests from parents or legal guardians for
Outside School Child Users
whom we have direct
parental consent
for (e.g for Premium Features or use of ClassDojo outside of the school).
Just email us at
privacy@classdojo.com
from the same email used to create your parent account or contact us
here
once you are signed in to your parent account and we’ll be happy to help.  Please note, however, that some content may need to be retained at the direction of the school for legal compliance reasons. In these cases, contact your child’s school to send us the request and we will happily process the request.  In addition to the choices provided to you as a parent under COPPA set forth below, you may also have certain other rights relating to your
personal information
, subject to local data protection laws and the jurisdiction you reside in. See the “
What are ClassDojo’s Commitments to Providing Transparency and Your Rights?
” Section in our Services Privacy Policy for more information on your rights.
Parental Controls
In addition to the choices above, parents can disable Home Islands for their child. This will prevent them from using Home Islands outside of school, but will not affect use of Class Islands in school. For more information see the
FAQ
.
Parents can disable their child from accessing monster customizer and revoke consent when provided in connection with use outside of school.
How does ClassDojo obtain consent?
ClassDojo follows the U.S. FTC’s COPPA rules for
parental consent
, including, where applicable, the use of which is commonly referred to a
“school consent”
if a school or teacher elects to utilize ClassDojo in the classroom. ClassDojo
will provide
all required notices and disclosures for schools to provide to parents when utilizing school consent. More detail on how ClassDojo obtains parental consent and what type of verifiable parental consent is used can be found
here
.  Although not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students and Outside School Child Accounts 13 and above at our discretion.  ClassDojo does not obtain parental consent for Home Island Guest Users as ClassDojo will either (1) not collect any personal information from such Home Island Guest Users or (2) only collect limited device or other persistent identifiers (e.g. IP address) that may be considered personal information (and not further collect any other personal information) solely for providing support for the internal operations (as that term is defined under COPPA) of Home Island (e.g. internal analysis). ClassDojo will ensure that such persistent identifiers are not used for unauthorized purposes outside of support for the internal operations (as that term is defined under COPPA) through training, data access and data segregation and storage.
ClassDojo extends the U.S.-based COPPA consent protections in all jurisdictions, even if not required. If we rely on other legally applicable grounds for processing children’s
personal information
(e.g. if we rely on legitimate interest in the European Union and the United Kingdom) when acting as a
Controller
(not in connection with school use), we will still use the FTC COPPA consent methods described to provide further transparency for parents.
Sharing Limited Student Data for Account Linking and Non-School Use
If a child is using
Home Islands
,
Dojo Tutor
, or the child (or their parent) is using some of our
Premium Features
or
Dojo Photobooks
, some of the child’s data, including what may be considered
Student Data
under various state student privacy laws or
education records
under
FERPA
, will be used and shared between in school and out of school use (use not in connection with a school) and the parent will have received
Direct Notice
of, and have provided consent for this use and sharing.  For example, if a child is connected to a school, the parent can elect to have the child's data obtained from school use then used to fill in the child's name for the
Outside School Child Account
.  Prior to this sharing, the child’s parent will have consented to this use and sharing. See
our FAQ
for more detail on what information is shared between
Outside School Child Accounts
and
Student Accounts
. Additionally, see
here
for more information on Dojo Islands and as well as our
FAQ
on Dojo Tutor. We have also obtained authorization through our
Student Data Privacy Addendum
and
Terms of Service
entered into with schools or districts to allow for this limited use and sharing of
Student Data
or
education records
. If your school or district has a custom Student Data Privacy Addendum that limits this sharing, we will also honor this.
Additionally, parents may choose to link their
ClassDojo Services
account with a
Dojo Tutor
account.  If a parent signs up for
Dojo Tutor
using their ClassDojo account, ClassDojo may share and use the parent’s
ClassDojo Services
login credentials (e.g., ClassDojo email address, user name) and their child’s name (and possibly other limited fields of
Student Data
or
personal information
of the child that the parent allows) to pre-populate the parent’s
Dojo Tutor
profile. Parents will have been prompted with Direct Notice of, and will have consented to that use and sharing of your child’s
Student Data
and
personal information
for this use.  While the child’s
personal information
(e.g., name) and tutoring information (e.g., tutoring assessments) will be linked and accessible in both the parent’s Dojo Tutor and ClassDojo Services accounts, the child’s
Student Account
information on ClassDojo will remain separate and viewable only through the parent’s
ClassDojo Services
login, ensuring that school information remains segregated and separate from non-school information.
Additionally, certain Dojo Tutor tutoring information, such as tutor assessments, feedback and other session information (e.g. session recordings) (“Dojo Tutor Information”) may be shared at the direction of the parent to their child’s teacher with the parent’s approval to the main ClassDojo Services (“Dojo Tutor Information Sharing”).  When this Dojo Tutor Information Sharing occurs with the ClassDojo Services, a copy of the Dojo Tutor Information will be made to share. This is a copy of the assessment and only this copy will become
Student Data
once the teacher has elected to save and bring this information into either their account or the student’s
Student Account
in the main ClassDojo Services. The child’s
Student Account
information on ClassDojo will remain separate, ensuring that school information remains segregated and separate from non-school information.  For more information, please see our

ABOUT THE PLEDGE
The Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and The Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) introduced a Student Privacy Pledge to safeguard student privacy regarding the collection, maintenance, and use of student personal information. The commitments are intended to concisely detail existing federal law and regulatory guidance regarding the collection and handling of student data, and to encourage service providers to more clearly articulate these practices. FPF and SIIA updated the Student Privacy Pledge in our Pledge process in 2020. To learn more, please visit the FAQs page.
The Pledge is not intended as a comprehensive privacy policy nor to be inclusive of all requirements to achieve compliance with all applicable federal or state laws. For additional information and guidance on relevant laws for parents, educators, and service providers, visit
studentprivacycompass.org

Support for The Student Privacy Pledge
FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM (FPF)
At a time when parents, teachers, schools, and administrators are more dependent than ever before on technology to support education and enable online learning, The Student Privacy Pledge is an important step forward in ensuring the tools students use to learn to enhance student privacy and promote data security. Like its predecessor, the Student Privacy Pledge demonstrates signatories’ ongoing commitment to safeguarding student data. The commitments in The Student Privacy Pledge will ensure that the Pledge continues to enhance trust between families, schools, and third-party service providers and to support the safe and effective use of student data for student, teacher, and school success.
– JULES POLONETSKY | CEO
SOFTWARE & INFORMATION INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (SIIA)
For six years, the Pledge has stood as a clear industry commitment
protecting the privacy and security of student information. The updates to the Pledge reflect a lengthy and collaborative process of stakeholder engagement representing the needs of our community. These updates stand as an important example of industry-leading to address legitimate privacy concerns.
– JEFF JOSEPH | PRESIDENT
CONSORTIUM FOR SCHOOL NETWORKING (COSN)
Education technology leaders expect transparency from their service providers and public commitments to privacy safeguards. The new K-12 Service Provider Pledge to Safeguard Student Privacy is a useful tool in building more transparency across the ecosystem and will be beneficial to school systems in support of their larger assessments of service providers.
– KEITH R. KRUEGER | CEO
DATA QUALITY CAMPAIGN
Everyone who uses student information has a responsibility to maintain students’ privacy and the security of their data. This pledge is an important declaration that vendors take seriously their obligation to safeguard student data – and that companies who opt into this public commitment are willing to be held accountable for doing so. Responsible practices that protect student data privacy ensure that data is used to help students, never to harm them. – Jennifer Bell-Ellwanger, president and CEO, Data Quality Campaign
– JENNIFER BELL-ELLWANGER | PRESIDENT AND CEO
NATIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION (NSBA)
This industry-led pledge to honor student data privacy is crucial as schools launch virtual platforms on a large scale. Ed tech providers who opt to take the pledge are demonstrating their public commitment to responsible data practices in a manner that will support school boards’ ongoing efforts to safeguard student privacy and ensure data security.
– ANNA MARIA CHÁVEZ | EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CEO
Innovate Edu | Project Unicorn
Privacy and security in education data is more important now than ever as schools adopt more edtech tools into their digital ecosystems. With the exciting release of the updated Student Privacy Pledge, new provisions and core protections will do more to support safe student data collection and preservation. Project Unicorn supports and endorses the Student Privacy Pledge as the gold standard in the edtech industry for communicating and compelling best privacy and security practices, making it an essential metric in the Project Unicorn Interoperability Rubric.

Private by design
Your privacy is our top priority
At ClassDojo, your privacy isn’t just a promise — it’s our top priority. 
Every ClassDojo product is created so that all your private information 
is kept just that: private.
We don’t share your information
. Your information is yours.
ClassDojo is fully certified by iKeepSafe.
And one of the first signatories of the Student Privacy Pledge.
Essential information only.
We only ask for the information necessary to run your account.
Secure by Design
Security you can rely on
ClassDojo works proactively to protect you and your account by verifying users, monitoring for unusual activity, performing continuous security testing, and undergoing rigorous third-party audits.
You’re always in control.
You choose who gets to be part of your community.
Your information is stored securely.
It is encrypted, and restricted to authorized users only.
Our cloud environment is hardened against attacks.
It is constantly monitored for malicious activity.
Built to keep kids safe
The best place on the internet for kids
ClassDojo’s simple guiding principle is to always act in the long-term best 
interest of kids. That’s why every ClassDojo product is designed for safety, 
positivity, and with full adult oversight.
Kids can only communicate with people they already know in real life,
with adult oversight.
Children can’t start or use a ClassDojo account without permission
from an adult at home or at school.
Every communication space for kids is carefully designed
to create a safe, positive environment.
District-wide control
District-wide oversight and control
The ClassDojo your school communities know and love now includes district-wide oversight and control. Including rostering, single sign-on, and full access to all messaging history within your district.
With single sign-on (SSO), staff access is secure
and can be revoked on a district-wide level.
Consistent privacy, safety, and security across your entire district
, all in one easy-to-use app.
Schoolwide records, district-wide access for admins
and activity logs, all with 24/7 access.

https://explore.zoom.us/en/schools-privacy-statement/:
This Children’s Educational Privacy Statement (“Statement”) describes the personal data we collect, use or disclose from students under the age of 18 when they receive educational services from schools and other organizations who are using Zoom Communication, Inc.’s (“Zoom”) meetings, webinars, or messaging platform (“Zoom Products”) to provide educational services to children.  This Statement supplements Zoom’s
Privacy Statement
and applies only if the account settings selected by a school or organization confirm that it provides educational services to children under 18.
What Personal Data Does Zoom Collect from Students?
Personal data is any information from or about an identified or identifiable person, including information that Zoom can associate with an individual person.  We may collect, or process on behalf of schools or other organizations providing educational services, the following categories of personal data when a student uses or interacts with Zoom Products to receive educational services, such as when they join their classroom or meet with their teacher on Zoom:
Profile and Participant Information:
Name, profile picture, contact information, and any other information a school or educational organization allows students to add to their profile or to add when registering for meetings, recordings or webinars hosted on the school or organization’s account.
Contacts and Calendar Information
:  Contact lists the school or educational service adds or allows students to use on their account (such as names and email addresses for other students in the school), as well as calendar information added to the account (such as a class schedule or upcoming school events).
Settings
:  Preferences and settings students set when using an educational account, such as microphone, audio and video settings, and screen sharing settings.
Device Information
:  Information about the computers, phones, and other devices students use when joining meetings or webinars or sending messages using Zoom Products, including device features (like microphone or camera versions and IDs), IP address (which may be used to infer general location at a city or country level) and WiFi information.
Meeting, Webinar, and Messaging Content:
If the school or educational organization chooses to record meetings or webinars to Zoom Cloud, Zoom will store these recordings on behalf of the school or organization.  The recordings may contain a student’s voice and image, messages, Q&A, or other content (such as a presentation or whiteboard) shared by a student during a meeting or webinar.  Zoom employees do not access this content unless the school or educational service directs us to do so, or as required for legal, security, or safety reasons.
Product Usage:
Information about how students and their devices interact with Zoom Products, such as when they join and leave a meeting, whether they send messages and with whom they message, mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes, or actions (such as mute/unmute or video on/off), and other inputs that help Zoom understand feature usage, improve product design, and suggest features.
How Do We Use Student Personal Data?
Zoom uses personal data collected from students to conduct the following activities:
Provide Educational Products and Services:
To provide products, features and services for schools and other organizations to use when providing educational services to children, including to customize the product and safety features and settings for a school environment. This may also include using personal data for customer support, which may include accessing audio, video, files, and messages, at the direction of the school or organization.
Product Research and Development:
To develop, test, and improve Zoom Products that are used in educational settings.
Authentication, Integrity, Security, and Safety:
To authenticate accounts and activity, detect, investigate, and prevent malicious conduct or unsafe experiences, address security threats, protect school and public safety, and secure Zoom Products.
Legal Reasons:
To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or government agencies, to investigate or participate in civil discovery, litigation, or other adversarial legal proceedings, and to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service or policies.
Zoom uses advanced tools to automatically scan content such as virtual backgrounds, profile images, and files uploaded or exchanged through chat, for the purpose of detecting and preventing violations of our terms or policies and illegal or other harmful activity, and its employees may investigate such content where required for legal, safety, or security reasons.
How Do We Share Student Personal Data?
Zoom does not disclose student’s data to third parties, except for:
service providers who help us provide Zoom Products and technical infrastructure;
where required for legal, security, or safety reasons;
or to other Zoom affiliates (such as Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which provides Zoom Phone) to enable additional products and features for use by schools and educational organizations.
What Student Information Do Schools See and Share on Zoom Products?
Depending on their policies, settings and how they use Zoom Products to provide educational services, the school or organization providing educational services may be able to see or to share the following personal data from students who join meetings or webinars on their account.  The school or other organization’s use and disclosure of student information is subject to the school or educational organization’s policies, not Zoom’s.  Zoom does not enable children to make personal information publicly available through the use of Zoom Products.
Student Usage and Content:
Depending on their settings, the school or other organization providing educational services – and the people they designate — can access (i) information about how students and their devices interact with the school or educational organization’s account; (ii) information about the participants who joined classrooms or meetings on their account (including participant name, display name, email address and participant ID); (iii) the content of recordings hosted on their account, as well as a transcript of audio, if enabled; and (iv) information provided in response to polls, Q&A or other content shared during classrooms, webinars and meetings on their account.
Teachers, Hosts and Participants
: Teachers, hosts and other participants in a classroom or meeting may be able to see students’ email, display name, and profile picture, as well as content and information shared by students during a meeting and webinar.  Depending on settings implemented by the school or educational organization, teachers, hosts and participants also may be able to record or save classroom or meeting content, audio transcripts, messages sent to Everyone or to them directly, and files, whiteboards, or other information shared during a classroom or educational meeting.
Third-Party App:
Schools or educational organizations may choose to install third-party apps to add features or educational services to their use of Zoom Products, including apps that may receive access to personal information about students and other users on their account.  Zoom does not pre-install any apps on educational accounts, and apps will not be able to access personal information from students receiving educational services on Zoom Products unless the school or educational organization chooses to approve a specific app.  Personal information shared by schools and educational organizations with third-party apps is subject to the school or organization’s policies and the app developers’ terms and privacy policies, not Zoom’s.
In the United States, before choosing to install third party-apps that may be used by children under the age of 13, schools or educational organizations must obtain parent or guardian consent to the third-party app’s data practices.  By installing any third-party app, these schools or other educational organizations agree to obtain such parent or guardian consent and must consent themselves to the disclosure of students’ personal information to the third-party app when installing the app.
How to Review and Delete Student Information
A school or other educational organization may review and delete a student’s information, if in compliance with any applicable law, from their administrator dashboard.  If you are a parent or student, please contact your school or other educational organization to access any personal information, limit a student’s access to Zoom Products features or services, or delete personal information or the student’s entire profile.  A school or other educational organization may also take steps to prevent a student from receiving educational services through the use of Zoom Products on its account in the future, such as by deleting the student’s profile from the school or other educational organization’s account and limiting the student’s access to use of Zoom.
