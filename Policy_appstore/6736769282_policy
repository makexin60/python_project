4. How we share information
Our goal
is
to provide the best services we can to you. Read on
for
more details about how your information
is
shared.
With our service providers and partners
We use your non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such
as
device information)
for
targeted online marketing through tools like Facebook Custom Audience to contact interested parties.
We
do
not require you to provide us with
any
contact information
in
order to download or use our product, we
do
not log or store your IP address, and we
do
not keep logs on your online activities. Therefore, we generally
do
not have Personal Information to share with law enforcement, and generally
do
not have the data to provide
in
response to law enforcement requests.
When
required
by law  We may disclose your information
if
reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such
as
a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii)
in
connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; or (iii) to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others.
To enforce legal rights  We may also share information: (i)
if
disclosure would mitigate our liability
in
an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii)
as
necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties and/or to comply with applicable law; (iii) to enforce our agreements or policies with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
5. Cross-border data transfers
Sharing of information laid out
in
Section 4 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers,
for
instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. The United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information
is
moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information
in
the country to which your information
is
transferred may be different from those
in
the country
in
which you live. The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses, which provide safeguards
for
personal information that
is
transferred outside of the EEA. We use these Model Clauses or other suitable safeguards to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries.
6. Device permissions
Mobile platforms have permission systems
for
specific types of device data and notifications, such
as
your location
as
well
as
push notifications. Where applicable, you can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course,
if
you
do
that, certain services may lose full functionality.
7. Uninstall
You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process
for
your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will
continue
to be stored.
8. How We Protect Your Information
The security of your personal information
is
important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it
is
received. Your account information
is
protected by a password. We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we
do
not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. We regularly monitor our systems
for
possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures. We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice
if
we suspect or detect
any
breach of security. If you believe that your account or information
is
no longer secure, please notify us immediately at [email protected].
9. How Long We Retaion Your Information
We retain your information only
for
as
long
as
is
necessary
for
the purposes
set
out
in
this policy,
for
as
long
as
your account
is
active or
as
needed to provide the services to you. We will also retain and use your information to the extent necessary:
to comply with applicable law;
to evidence our compliance with applicable law;
if
there
is
an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it
is
resolved; or
10. Children's privacy
Our services are intended
for
general audiences over the age of 13 years old (or over the age of 16
