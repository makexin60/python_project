Privacy Policy
Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you in the future to tell you about new products or announcements, or changes to this privacy policy.
Security
We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the App, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.
Business Transfers
If the company, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event the company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of the company may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
Updates
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time at our sole discretion. We encourage you to check this page regularly for updates. Your continued use of this App after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
