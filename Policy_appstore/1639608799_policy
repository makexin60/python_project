Purpose and scope
Carrot Fertility, Inc. (“Carrot,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Notice explains how your Personal Information is collected, used, stored, processed, transferred, and disclosed by Carrot.
This Privacy Notice applies to our website
https://get-carrot.com
(our "Website") and any other website, mobile application, or online service that links to this Privacy Notice (collectively, our "Service").
The Service may contain links to and from third party websites of our business partners, advertisers, and social media sites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies. We may also share a user ID with third-party websites allowing us and the third-party website provider to jointly track specified activities across both websites.
We strongly recommend that you read their privacy policies and terms and conditions of use to understand how they collect, use, and share information
.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on the websites of third party sites

HIPAA Applicability
To the extent that you are subject to United States benefit and taxation laws, and that your employer has established a health reimbursement arrangement plan or HRA (i.e., the “Covered Entity”), Carrot is considered a Business Associate to the Covered Entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"). Please review the Covered Entity’s “Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)” for an explanation of how that entity will collect, use, disclose, and protect your “Protected Health Information (PHI).”
chevron_right
Important Terminology
Carrot is the “Data Controller” responsible for protecting your Personal Information, which means we determine and are responsible for how your Personal Information is handled. Your employer will also initially send us your name and eligibility information ("Employee Eligibility File"). If you have queries regarding the information contained in the Employee Eligibility File, please contact your employer, who is the Data Controller of such information.
"Personal information" encompasses all “Personal Data” as defined in Art. 4 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), meaning any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual; provided, that in such circumstance(s) that applicable data protection laws require otherwise, “Personal information” has the meaning ascribed to it in such law(s).
