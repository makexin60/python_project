We will charge the Requester's credit card according to the amount the Requester has agreed to on the Faber Platform with respect to all Professional Services and/or Merchandise, the Requester has ordered, and for all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees or expenses associated with a Professional Service, and the Requester hereby authorizes us to charge the credit card on file in the Requester's Faber Platform account for such amounts.

Seventy­two (72) hours after a Professional Service is completed, if there is no complaint by the Requester, we will mark the Professional Service as closed. If the Requester has agreed with the Professional to extend or reduce the hours in or to reschedule a requested Professional Service, the Requester bears the responsibility for notifying Faber. Requesters must notify Faber either by changing the date or hours of the requested Professional Service through the Faber Platform. All Payments by Requesters must be made through the Faber Platform. Any Payments paid outside of the Faber Platform are not subject to refunds or credits will be provided once the Requester's credit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific promotions, or to correct any errors we have made. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. Requesters will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Professional Service(s) provided (other than taxes based on Fabers income).

A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator's decision/award.
