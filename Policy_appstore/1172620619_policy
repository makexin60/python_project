Additional or separate terms may apply to your interactions with other Kappa websites, and to your use of individual services or features available on a Kappa Property, such as reviews. To the extent that the provisions of any additional terms conflict with these Conditions of Use, the provisions of the additional terms will govern. References to “Kappa,” “our,” “we,” or “us” may refer to Kappa Publishing Group, Inc and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and designees. We may make changes to any Kappa Property and the Conditions of Use. It is your responsibility to review the Conditions of Use for updates or changes. If you do not agree with the Conditions of Use, you should not use the Kappa Properties.

Information on Our Site
We try to be as accurate as possible. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other Kappa Property content is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Prices and promotions are subject to change, and may vary from those offered in stores or printed ads. We cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until you place your order. Despite our best efforts, the offer may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order or we may contact you for instructions on the order.
Order Confirmation
Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or part of an order that we’ve already charged you for, we’ll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.

You will comply with all applicable export and re-export restrictions, laws, and regulations, and you will not transfer, or encourage, assist, or authorize the transfer of any Software to a prohibited country or otherwise in violation of any restriction, law, or regulation.
Security
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer or device. You agree to not share your account credentials with others. You may use the Kappa Properties only for lawful purposes. Activities including, but not limited to, tampering with any Kappa Property, misrepresenting the identity of a user, and using buying agents or conducting fraudulent activities, on the Kappa Properties are prohibited.
You may not violate or attempt to violate the security of the Kappa Properties, including by, without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for you or logging on to a server or an account which you are not authorized to access; (b) using any Kappa Property for unintended purposes or trying to change the behavior of any Kappa Property; (c) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; (d) attempting to interfere with service to any user, host or network, including without limitation via means of submitting a virus to any Kappa Property, overloading, “flooding,” “spamming,” “mailbombing” or “crashing”; (e) forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or newsgroup posting; or (f) forging communications on behalf of Kappa (impersonating Kappa) or to any Kappa Property (impersonating as a legitimate user). You may not send unsolicited or unauthorized e-mail on behalf of Kappa, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services. We may prosecute you to the full extent of the law for any violation of these Conditions of Use. You may not use any device, software or routine or data to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of any Kappa Property or any activity being conducted on any Kappa Property. You may not use or attempt to use any engine, software, tool, agent, data or other device or mechanism (including without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search any Kappa Property other than the search engine and search agents we provide and generally publicly available browsers.
Disputes
Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of any Kappa Property, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Kappa or through any Kappa Property will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its applicable Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY. ALTHOUGH REVIEW IS LIMITED, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT, AND MUST ENFORCE THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED IN THESE CONDITIONS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a demand to Kappa describing your claim at 6198 Butler Pike, Blue Bell, PA 19422 The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings of any nature or in any forum will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. This means that you may not purport to act on behalf of a class or any other person. Likewise, an arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable. This means that any claim would be decided by a judge, not a jury.
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to seek to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
Applicable Law
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW (OR IN THE ABSENCE OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, THEN THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA), WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, WILL GOVERN THESE CONDITIONS OF USE AND APPLY TO ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AGAINST KAPPA ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF ANY KAPPA PROPERTY OR TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED BY KAPPA OR THROUGH ANY KAPPA PROPERTY.
Termination of Use
We may, in our sole discretion, terminate your account or your use of the Kappa Properties at any time. You are personally liable for any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination. We may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspects of any Kappa Property at any time without prior notice.

We may share personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution, or similar event. If such an event takes place, we’ll notify you through e-mail (if we have your email address) and/or a prominent notice on our applicable website(s) of any change in ownership, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
How We Protect Your Information
