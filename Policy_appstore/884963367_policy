Privacy and your information
We respect your privacy
At TomTom, we believe that your private data is yours, and we do everything it takes to keep it truly private.
When you are using a TomTom navigation product or app, you can understand what personal data we collect from you and how we are using it. You can also control what we do with your data. By letting us use your data, you’re helping TomTom make better products for you – contributing to a safer, cleaner and congestion-free world.
This privacy policy contains a comprehensive overview of our privacy approach. TomTom sat nav devices and apps such as AmiGO or GO Navigation contain more specific product-related privacy details on your device.
This privacy policy was last edited on August 1, 2024, and subject to change at any time with or without further notice. We recommend that you re-visit from time to time to see if there have been updates.

General
Privacy is a cornerstone of our business. Based in Europe, our operations are subject to global privacy laws and regulations, including the European privacy laws ( (General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’)). GDPR privacy rules are considered to be the most demanding set of regulations in the world, offering a high level of data protection. Our global policies on privacy and the processing of your personal data reflect these standards, and in some cases the regulations are more stringent.

Big data
Big data drives our business, but your privacy comes first. We collect data from our websites, products and services. Overall, there are four different types of data that we use:
Directly Identifiable data:
When you create a TomTom account, purchase and use our products or services, contact customer portal, or otherwise interact with us, you directly supply to TomTom personal data such as your name and email address, your home address and favorite locations that you synchronize between devices, reported feedback about speed cameras or map errors, your age and phone number. See more in the TomTom account section.
Sensor data:
Many TomTom products are equipped with sensors or use device sensors such as GPS receivers, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, camera, microphone, G-force and touch screens. These sensors automatically collect data when activated.
Metadata:
While you use our websites, products and services, metadata gets automatically collected or generated as a result of you using a device, transmitting your data over a network or requesting a specific service such as TomTom Traffic. This data could contain information about your technical configuration, device settings, user interface and other events related to your usage, and can be linked to other details such as IP-addresses, unique identifiers, cookies (see also our
cookie policy
) and other records of your activities.
Data from others:
Our clients, such as car manufacturers, could share data with TomTom that they have collected under their responsibility and in accordance with their privacy policies, including the driver’s consent requirements. Examples of data delivered and processed in accordance with the car manufacturers instructions and technical standards, could include among others GPS location data, car and camara sensor data, active community input (feedback reported by the driver of the car manufacturer such as speed camara or hazard), application usage data, device properties data (brand, model, type, engine type and battery capacity), randomly generated session IDs or access tokens.  We only use that data within the limits instructed by these parties, while adhering to contractual arrangements. To learn how TomTom handles data received by its car manufacturers customer, please see section
Security
.
Help us learn
TomTom does not process any personal data for the purpose of identifying you. Instead, you can help TomTom keep our products and services secure such as AmiGO and GO Navigation apps or Personal Navigation Device (PND), and have them perform as expected and improve the quality and user experience by sharing data on how and when you use our apps, products and services. This includes information about your device, operating software and information we receive when you use certain features such as locations, route planning, destinations and search.
We categorize our users based on aggregated information such as frequency of use, specific features, region information (e.g., country and city), product and device information. Our analysis does not contain individual location information or information that you have entered but may include information that identifies your device, such as a hashed identifier. You can stop sending this information at any time by adjusting the product settings to withdraw your consent. Some TomTom products such as AmiGO and GO Navigation apps or Personal Navigation Device (PND) ask your approval to collect your journey information for a longer period to analyze patterns and behavior. More details are available in the product privacy settings and in the
DRIVE section
.
We also collect analytics, technical and diagnostic information which may include information that identifies your device. This helps us to investigate crashes or service disruptions, detect fraud and abuse, security management, performance and capacity management, as well as for (aggregated) reporting purposes and to improve the quality of our products and services by being able to show you more accurate real-time information and develop better navigation products. We always protect your identity and remove personal user details by using different techniques such as temporary random identifiers to prevent the data can be easily linked back to you, your device or product. Third parties that support our business could also receive this data subject to the privacy policy of that third party, more information can be found in the product settings.
Security
To ensure that TomTom meets the highest security standards, TomTom holds various
compliance certificates
, such as ISO/IEC 27018:2019 for Information Security Management Systems to protect personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processor, ISO/IEC 27001:2022 for Information Security Management Systems outlining the implemented policies and procedures to manage risk and secure our data effectively, as well as TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange) certification, which is an industry-standard information security assessment catalog that focuses on operational security, data protection, third-party connections and prototype protection in the European automotive industry.
Additionally, to protect your data against unauthorized access TomTom applies appropriate technical, operational and security industry standards and methods, such as de-identification, anonimization, encryption or temporary random identifiers to prevent location details from being easily linked back to you or your device..
Within 24 hours of shutting down your device or app, TomTom automatically and irreversibly erases data that we hold which could re-identify you or your device.
To protect your journey information against unauthorized access, your device will randomly generate an identifier which is associated with your journey information sent to TomTom at regular intervals.
We don’t know where you have been and can’t tell anyone else, even if we were forced to. We never link actual location data to your TomTom account or any other information that identifies you directly. We also don’t sell your location data - our products are 100% ad-free.
We will not give anyone else other than our service providers access to the information subject to contractual safeguards and we don’t use it for any other purpose than communicated to you unless we have been lawfully ordered to do so. With the goal of enabling the collection and storage of the data between our online product and services, as well as car manufacturers and TomTom in a secure manner, we use an advanced technological system for data collection and archiving. This system applies technical measures, so the data is processed in a way that is secure and in compliance with privacy laws by adding layer of abstraction via encrypted, short-lived session codes to link sessions and datapoints from different backend systems that belong to the same device without revealing the particular device. In this way, it is not possible to disclose the devices beyond the systems and to correlate data between different databases due to different encrypted session codes, which vary per backend system, per device and per lifetime. The information may be further aggregated for analysis and system improvement to the benefit of the car driver (for instance, measuring the estimated travel time to reach a selected destination, or for electric vehicle drivers an accurate estimation of reachable range and the battery level at the next stop).
TomTom account
You can create your TomTom account when using our navigation devices, apps or website. For this we need some minimum details about you:
Email address – this is your username when you log in to your TomTom account. With your permission, we will send you emails about software updates, the latest news about TomTom products, how to get the most out of your product and exclusive offers. You can easily change your email preferences in your online account settings or unsubscribe via the link in the emails that you have received.
Name and country.
Password – we recommend you pick a strong password that you don’t use for anything else. We store the password in encrypted code, so we don’t see what your password is.
If you log into TomTom using Facebook or Google (collectively, “Third-Party Accounts”), we will create a TomTom account with your name and email address you agreed to make available. This information is collected by the Third-Party Account providers and is provided to TomTom under their privacy policies.
When you purchase a TomTom product or service via our online store, information about your orders, delivery address, repairs, subscriptions, navigation devices and apps could be linked to your TomTom account, and is visible by logging in to your account via tomtom.com. We don’t store your payment details, such as credit card information. These details are securely kept by our payment provider in their secure environment and TomTom has no access to this data.
TomTom Account is a cloud-based platform that saves your settings, preferences, favorite locations and destinations. When you log-in into your TomTom Account, this data becomes automatically available to all devices and apps you logged in to with the same account. The information within your TomTom Account will retain references to all your devices or apps associated with your account and doesn’t have access to your passwords.
When you log out of your TomTom Account, any adjustment of your data such as a planned route via another device will no longer be synchronized to that specific device. Your data within your TomTom Account will remain available via plan.tomtom.com or other logged in devices until you actively delete it via plan.tomtom.com (former Mydrive.tomtom.com) or by using devices and apps that support deletion. TomTom Account data is securely stored in the EU and apart from service providers that processes this data subject to contractual safeguards, TomTom will not give anyone else access to your TomTom Account data or use it for any other purpose than communicated to you unless we have been lawfully ordered to do so.
In case third parties such as car manufacturers select TomTom as service provider to deliver a cloud-based platform as part of the product portfolio offered to their clients, these parties make  an account mechanism available under their own brand through their devices and apps. The collection and usage of data occurs under the full responsibility of these third parties providing services, devices or apps in accordance with their privacy policies. TomTom is only allowed to use this data within the limits as instructed by these parties while adhering to contractual privacy arrangements at the same time.
You can find more details about how to submit requests for accessing or deleting your (account) data with TomTom on our
GDPR support page
