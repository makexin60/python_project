Barcelona-92, 57, Esc.2, the city of Torrent (Spain), him being the responsible of the treatment of this information. Only this person and his employees in charge may treat your personal information and which must not under any circumstances be transferred, sold or transmitted to third parties.
Personal data to be collected
The information we collect from our customers helps us personalize and improve the service we offer. We use your information to manage the orders you make for services and content through our applications or website, such as the acquisition of levels or the elimination of advertising in our applications.
The information provided by you also helps to be able to store the advances you make in language learning and to allow a correct synchronization between your devices in order to make optimal use of the application.
We also make use of that information so we can contact you regarding orders you have made, answer to doubts you have transmitted, services and promotional offers, update our records, or take care of your account.
The information provided allows us to improve our services, as well as prevent or detect fraud or abuse on our website and applications.
- Information that you provide us: We will never ask you for personal information such as name, address, phone number or e-mail. So no personal data will be stored in our server.
- Automatic information: When you interact with our website or app we receive and store certain types of information, to facilitate navigation and use. As most websites do, we also use cookies to gather information when your browser accesses AltairApps.com or advertising or other content that is offered by us. This information may include, among others: language of your browser, the country in which you are located, etc. By using our apps or accessing our website and accepting and consenting to the localization services, the information about your position may be used for the management of the advertising we will offer in the apps. This information will always be transmitted in a completely anonymous way to the companies that manage such advertising to offer greater customization in this content. This information will never be collected by us.
Information transfer
We are aware of the importance that you give to personal information that you provide us and therefore we never give it to third parties under any circumstances, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
Personal information can only be transmitted in extraordinary situations in which for legal reasons competent authorities request it and with the necessary authorizations to such cases.
Transfer of societies
In case of a transfer of our apps and services to another company, the information we possess would be transmitted to the company that receives the service under the same conditions as set forth in this privacy policy. The company that received such information would become responsible and would have to inform you duly of possible changes that occur in this privacy policy.
Information security
We use all the means at our disposal so that your information is secure at all times. Among these means we highlight the following:
- By giving us your personal information we use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, by which all information is transmitted securely by means of encryption.
- When placing an order, your payment information is transmitted directly to the company that manages the transaction (Apple or Google) and we do not receive or store this information at any time. We only receive and store the identification number of the payment transaction for possible claims or request for information on your behalf about the purchased service.
- Your password is stored on our server unidirectionally encrypted using SHA1, and therefore no one can access your password, not even us. This makes it impossible for us to tell you your password in case you forget it. If the latter occurs, we can only reset the password by sending you a new random one to your e-mail address which must then be modified in your account.
It is important that you protect yourself from third party access to your account. At the end of each use of our services, be sure to log off when using shared computers.
We will never ask you to send us your data or password by e-mail. Be sure to login to your account solely via our website https://altairapps.com or via any of our applications. Access through any other means or website may be fraudulent and should be avoided.
Advertisements and links to other web pages

Access to information
You can access your personal information and may modify it at any time by logging into your account through any of our services.
Once you have edited your information, we will not keep the previous information. Only your old e-mail address will be saved until you have validated the new one. In this case, for security reasons, we will use the former e-mail address for communication purposes until you have validated the new one. Once the validation has been carried out, we will delete the old address.
When you receive a promotional e-mail, you can always stop receiving such e-mails by following the instructions that will appear in the e-mail.
You will also have the possibility to completely delete your account. All your personal information will be deleted likewise. We will only keep information for statistical purposes regarding your usage of our services. This information will be stored anonymously, since it cannot be linked to any personal information.
