How Navmii retains data we collect
Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary. This section describes why we hold onto different types of data for different periods of time.
Information retained until you remove it
- such as your “Home, “work”, favorites, email address and other account related information. We’ll keep this data in your Navmii Account until you choose to remove it and/or update it.
Information retained until your Navmii Account is deleted
- we may keep some data for the life of your Navmii Account if it’s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services.

When you delete your Navmii Account, the information about how many reports you have submitted is also removed.
Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
- sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time.

Reasons we might retain some data for extended periods of time include: Security, fraud & abuse prevention, Financial record-keeping, Complying with legal or regulatory requirements, Ensuring the continuity of our services, Direct communications with Navmii

Navmii may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on theServices, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the Services, to the Services’ providers, partners and any other third party. For example, GPS information that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map editors in an aggregated and/or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map problems, traffic data may be provided to cities, and aggregated ads analysis may be provided to advertisers.

Navmii allows advertisers to run ad campaigns on the Services.
Please note:
We don’t knowingly collect nor do we show you personalised ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll     connect your call and share your phone number with the flower shop.
As described under “When Navmii shares your information” section above, we work with other Google’s services (such asGoogle Doubleclick Bid Manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Navmii, Google, and websites & apps that partner with Google, Navmii may share information with these services such as a unique identifier for advertising (Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies).

Information security
Navmii considers information security to be a top priority. Navmii services are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. Navmii implements systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimise the risk of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorised access or use of information. For example, we review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorised access to our systems. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Navmii employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.
However, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance. Therefore, although Navmii takes great efforts to protect your personal information, Navmii cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that Navmii’s databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
