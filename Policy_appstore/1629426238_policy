Provision of our sleep analysis & training services
To provide our sleep analysis & training services, we collect and process
- Your first name
- Your e-mail address
- Your year of birth
- Your sleep metrics

- Information on lifestyle and sleeping habits
Our iOS and Android apps are provided on Hetzner servers. As part of the infrastructure operation, Hetzner collects technical information such as your IP address and user behavior relevant for error analysis.
Your health data such as sleep habits and heart rate variability are analyzed in the Google Cloud in Frankfurt.
The conclusion of a paid sleep² subscription is processed via the Apple Store for iOS and the Play Store on Android devices. Google and Apple process your data here, which is required for payment processing from a legal perspective. Apple and Google may also collect other data relevant to the App Store and Play Store. Further information can be found directly in Apple's App Store Privacy Policy and in the Google Play Store Terms of Use and Google Privacy Policy.
We use the Google Cloud in Frankfurt to make our website available to you. Google collects technical information such as your IP address and user behavior relevant for error analysis as part of website operation.
You can send us messages and questions via our contact form. We use the data you provide, such as your name, email address and optional telephone number, as well as information that you send us via the free text field, to answer your inquiries and, if necessary, to get in touch with you via available communication channels. You can also use the contact form to sign up for our newsletter.
You can use our sleep questionnaire on the website to provide us with information about your sleep behavior. We use this data to give you a brief analysis of your sleep quality. You can also leave us your e-mail address at the end of the questionnaire so that we can send you further details about your results by e-mail. You also have the option to sign up for the newsletter here.
We use third-party services to send you push notifications that regularly remind you to stay on the ball with your sleep training.
To send you push notifications via the Android app, we use the US service "OneSignal". OneSignal can collect the following data from you as part of the service:
- How a user has used the app (e.g. session duration, timestamp)
- Purchases made within an app.
- Information about the end user's transactions and interactions with the app
- Mobile device or account identifiers. These mobile IDs can be linked to other information, including data segments.
- Precise location information, generally an End User's latitude and longitude data (i.e., GPS-level data) or WiFi information, which we may associate with Mobile IDs and which may be collected whether or not an App is used. (Location information is only collected if the user has given the app permission to collect it)
- IP address and system configuration information
- Information associated with or related to devices, such as device type (e.g. cell phone, tablet); operating system type and version (e.g. Android, iOS); network provider; mobile browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome, etc.); language setting; time zone; and network status type (such as WiFi).
You can find further data protection-relevant information in the OneSignal Privacy Policy.
We use the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to send you push notifications via the iOS app. APNS can collect the following data from you as part of the service:
- Device information: The APNS can collect information about the device on which the app is installed, such as device type, operating system version and device ID.
- Token: The APNS uses device tokens to send the push notifications to the correct device. These tokens can be seen as a kind of identifier, but are not directly linked to personal information.
- Push notification data: The APNS can store information about the push notifications sent, such as the content of the notification, the time it was sent and the recipient.
Use of data for research purposes
The University of Salzburg uses data such as your sleeping habits (if available), your date of birth and your gender for purely scientific research purposes. Heart variability data is collected exclusively via Polar sensors and read directly into the app. This data is also used by the university for purely scientific research purposes. All data that is read in via Google Fit or Google Health Connect is excluded from this research purpose.
Data use for marketing purposes
If you sign up for the sleep² newsletter, we will use your email address to send you regular updates about sleep². The newsletter is sent via the European marketing cloud provider "Brevo". Brevo also allows us to analyze the behavior of newsletter recipients. Among other things, this allows us to determine who has opened a newsletter or clicked on a link. You can find more information in the Brevo privacy policy.
Use of data to improve the user experience
We use Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to analyze your user behavior on our website and to improve your user experience. Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager collect data such as:
- Device information: Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager collect information about the device the user is using, such as the device type, operating system and browser type.

- Conversion data: Google Tag Manager can capture data about conversions, such as completing a purchase, filling out a form or signing up for a newsletter.
Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found on the Google support website.
Google Tag Manager is a tool that allows us to manage tags on our website. Tags are code snippets that are used to implement various functions on a website, such as tracking user activity, collecting conversion data or integrating advertising materials.
You can find out more about data processing using Google services in the Google privacy policy.
Similar to the recording of user behavior on the website, we use "Firebase Analytics" to record user behavior on our iOS and Android app. Firebase Analytics is based on Google Analytics and collects data such as

Privacy policy
General
nukkuaa GmbH is a limited liability company with its registered office in Wals-Siezenheim, registered in the commercial register of the Salzburg Regional Court FN 581365.
- Nukkuaa operates a product website at
https://www.sleep2.com/
(the "Website").
- Nukkuaa operates the sleep² app (the "App"), a sleep analysis & training application in the "Health & Fitness" category.
This Privacy Policy clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the collection and use of data of customers (our "Users") by the "Website" and the "App". The protection of your personal data is of particular concern to us. We therefore process your data exclusively on the basis of the statutory provisions. In this privacy policy, we inform you about the most important aspects of data processing in the context of our website and our app.
For what purpose is personal data used?
Data protection and full transparency in handling your data are core concerns for us. Therefore, we would like to inform you in detail below about what we use which of your data for.
In summary, we use your data to provide you with our service to contact you for marketing purposes and to inform you about news and to improve your user experience in the app and on the website. Data collected and analyzed via Polar sensors (heart rate variability) may be used by the University of Salzburg for research purposes only. All data read in via Google Fit or Google Health Connect is excluded from this research purpose. Sleep² neither exchanges data nor builds databases in co-operation with external parties.
We only use your data for the purposes stated in this privacy policy and do not pass your data on to other third parties. This also means that we do not sell or offer your personal data for sale.
You have the option of objecting to certain purposes and the associated collection of your data, for example by not subscribing to the newsletter, rejecting app tracking in the app or cookies on our website.
Provision of our sleep analysis & training services
To provide our sleep analysis & training services, we collect and process
- Your first name
- Your e-mail address
- Your year of birth
- Your sleep metrics
- Your heart rate variability (if available)
- Information on lifestyle and sleeping habits
Our iOS and Android apps are provided on Hetzner servers. As part of the infrastructure operation, Hetzner collects technical information such as your IP address and user behavior relevant for error analysis.
Your health data such as sleep habits and heart rate variability are analyzed in the Google Cloud in Frankfurt.
The conclusion of a paid sleep² subscription is processed via the Apple Store for iOS and the Play Store on Android devices. Google and Apple process your data here, which is required for payment processing from a legal perspective. Apple and Google may also collect other data relevant to the App Store and Play Store. Further information can be found directly in Apple's App Store Privacy Policy and in the Google Play Store Terms of Use and Google Privacy Policy.
We use the Google Cloud in Frankfurt to make our website available to you. Google collects technical information such as your IP address and user behavior relevant for error analysis as part of website operation.
You can send us messages and questions via our contact form. We use the data you provide, such as your name, email address and optional telephone number, as well as information that you send us via the free text field, to answer your inquiries and, if necessary, to get in touch with you via available communication channels. You can also use the contact form to sign up for our newsletter.
You can use our sleep questionnaire on the website to provide us with information about your sleep behavior. We use this data to give you a brief analysis of your sleep quality. You can also leave us your e-mail address at the end of the questionnaire so that we can send you further details about your results by e-mail. You also have the option to sign up for the newsletter here.
We use third-party services to send you push notifications that regularly remind you to stay on the ball with your sleep training.
To send you push notifications via the Android app, we use the US service "OneSignal". OneSignal can collect the following data from you as part of the service:
- How a user has used the app (e.g. session duration, timestamp)
- Purchases made within an app.
- Information about the end user's transactions and interactions with the app
- Mobile device or account identifiers. These mobile IDs can be linked to other information, including data segments.
- Precise location information, generally an End User's latitude and longitude data (i.e., GPS-level data) or WiFi information, which we may associate with Mobile IDs and which may be collected whether or not an App is used. (Location information is only collected if the user has given the app permission to collect it)
- IP address and system configuration information
- Information associated with or related to devices, such as device type (e.g. cell phone, tablet); operating system type and version (e.g. Android, iOS); network provider; mobile browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome, etc.); language setting; time zone; and network status type (such as WiFi).
You can find further data protection-relevant information in the OneSignal Privacy Policy.
We use the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to send you push notifications via the iOS app. APNS can collect the following data from you as part of the service:
- Device information: The APNS can collect information about the device on which the app is installed, such as device type, operating system version and device ID.
- Token: The APNS uses device tokens to send the push notifications to the correct device. These tokens can be seen as a kind of identifier, but are not directly linked to personal information.
- Push notification data: The APNS can store information about the push notifications sent, such as the content of the notification, the time it was sent and the recipient.
Use of data for research purposes
The University of Salzburg uses data such as your sleeping habits (if available), your date of birth and your gender for purely scientific research purposes. Heart variability data is collected exclusively via Polar sensors and read directly into the app. This data is also used by the university for purely scientific research purposes. All data that is read in via Google Fit or Google Health Connect is excluded from this research purpose.
Data use for marketing purposes
If you sign up for the sleep² newsletter, we will use your email address to send you regular updates about sleep². The newsletter is sent via the European marketing cloud provider "Brevo". Brevo also allows us to analyze the behavior of newsletter recipients. Among other things, this allows us to determine who has opened a newsletter or clicked on a link. You can find more information in the Brevo privacy policy.
Use of data to improve the user experience
We use Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to analyze your user behavior on our website and to improve your user experience. Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager collect data such as:
- Device information: Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager collect information about the device the user is using, such as the device type, operating system and browser type.

- Event data: Google Tag Manager can record events on the website, such as clicks on certain elements, filling out forms or completing a purchase.
- Conversion data: Google Tag Manager can capture data about conversions, such as completing a purchase, filling out a form or signing up for a newsletter.
Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found on the Google support website.
Google Tag Manager is a tool that allows us to manage tags on our website. Tags are code snippets that are used to implement various functions on a website, such as tracking user activity, collecting conversion data or integrating advertising materials.
You can find out more about data processing using Google services in the Google privacy policy.
Similar to the recording of user behavior on the website, we use "Firebase Analytics" to record user behavior on our iOS and Android app. Firebase Analytics is based on Google Analytics and collects data such as

- Event data: Events that occur in the app are captured, such as opening a specific feature, completing a purchase or filling out a form.
- User flow: Firebase Analytics can track the user flow within the app to understand how users navigate through the different screens and functions of the app.
