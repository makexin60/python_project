DataViz Privacy Policy
Introduction
At DataViz, we have always taken your privacy very seriously. We are NOT in the business of selling, renting or disclosing your personally identifiable information to third parties. DataViz has been in business for more than 30 years and we have always collected as little personal information as possible. The information that we collect is solely for the purposes of connecting with our customers,  understanding their needs, and seamless operation of our products.
We have created this statement to describe our commitment to your privacy. This policy applies to the information that we collect about you when you use and purchase our software products and services, and visit our website. (The software, services and website are collectively referred to as “the Services” below.) The following details of the policy describe the information that we collect and how we use it.
Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may need to update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We encourage you to check this page from time to time for any changes. If we do need to make changes, we will notify you by revising the Change Log at the bottom of this page. If there is a significant change, we will provide additional notice by adding a statement to our homepage and/or by sending you an email (and seeking your consent if required). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
Information That We Collect & How We Use It
We only collect information about you to provide the Services, to communicate with you, or to make the Services better. We collect this information when you provide it to us or automatically through operating the Services. We do not receive any additional information about you from outside sources.
For Docs To Go:
We collect your email address which you provide to us when you (optionally) register your product.
Ad Supported Versions of Docs To Go:
Some versions of Docs To Go are provided free of charge and are supported by ads. The Docs To Go app itself does not collect or store any information for the purposes of advertising. No personal information is retained by the Docs To Go client apps and no personal information is communicated back to DataViz’s servers.
We include a third party ad service that can access some amount of information about you from your device for the purpose of delivering targeted ads. The information that is accessed is subject to controls on your device and the permissions that you grant to the Docs To Go app.
Please visit our ad partner site for additional information at:
https://www.mopub.com/en/legal/privacy
Visit the Docs To Go page to learn about paid versions of the app that do not have ads.
For Passwords Plus:
We collect your email address which you provide to us when setting up your sync account. We use your email address as your account identifier so that we can store your encrypted data for backup and secure syncing across your devices. For technical support, we may need you to provide your email address to allow us to identify your account in the Cloud Sync service.
We store your Passwords Plus data files on our secure servers, but we do not have any access to the data in these files. Your data is kept encrypted at all times that it is on our servers and is only decrypted on your device when you enter your private password into the Passwords Plus client application. Data is transferred between the client application and server over a secure SSL connection.
We do not store your Passwords Plus password anywhere at DataViz. If you forget your master password, you will be unable to open your Passwords Plus data. There is no “forgot my password” option, as the passwords are not stored anywhere. The Passwords Plus client application will prompt you for your password to unlock your data files, but it never retains your password.
For DailyBalance:
We collect your name and email address which you provide to us when creating your account. We use this to identify your account to store your DailyBalance data for backup and to enable syncing across all of your devices.
We also prompt you to create a password for your account. Your password is securely stored using industry best practices to encrypt and obscure your password so that it cannot be read by anyone at DataViz. If you forget your password, you will need to reset it via the Account page on our website. This password is only used to verify your identity when logging into our website or into a DailyBalance client application.
We automatically store your DailyBalance data files on our secure servers. Your data is kept encrypted at all times that it is on our servers. All data is transferred between your device and the server over a secure SSL connection. We do not have access to the content (e.g. Tasks, Triggers, etc.) stored in your data files.
When you install DailyBalance on a new device and log into your account, we automatically collect the name associated with your device, operating system and device type. We use this information to allow you to identify the devices associated with your account and to allow you to sync your data across your devices. We may also use the operating system and device type information in aggregate to improve the product.
When you use DailyBalance, we may also automatically collect usage information (e.g. counts of the number of Tasks, Triggers, etc.) that you have in your DailyBalance data. We use this information in aggregate to understand general usage patterns of our user base and improve the quality of the product.
We do not track or capture any of the content of your DailyBalance data (e.g., Tasks, Triggers, etc).
Use of Email to Contact You:
For all of our products, we may use the email address that you provided to us to contact you for the following reasons:
Product operational events such as when you add a device to your account, password reset requests, and payment confirmations.
Keep you informed of major new releases of our products.
Provide helpful hints and tips on how to use our products.
Make special offers that we extend only to our registered customers.
See the Unsubscribe link on our website to set your email preferences. You can opt out of promotional emails but we will still contact you with product operational emails, e.g., reset password requests, payment confirmations, etc.
Purchasing Information:
If you purchase through an “app store” (e.g., Apple, Google Play, etc.), DataViz does not receive any of your payment information.
If you purchase through the DataViz website, we integrate
FastSpring
as a third party payment processor who collects and stores your purchasing information. DataViz does not store any credit card or other payment information.
Technical Support:
You may provide us an additional email when you contact us for support that is different than your account email. We do not store this email or add it to our mailing lists unless requested. We will only use that email for the purpose of the support case.
If you run into a more complicated technical issue, we may ask you to email or upload log files. These log files may contain additional information about your data and usage patterns, but are necessary for troubleshooting. These files are stored on our secure servers while your case is open and are purged shortly after your case is resolved.
Information Storage and Security
The information that we store is kept in a secure cloud service within the United States. DataViz uses a third party cloud computing partner to provide the necessary storage and related technology required to store your data and run our products. This third party is a host but does not have access to the content of your data.

Here’s what our developers are saying
“
Implementing MAX not only increased our product revenue, but it saved us a lot of operational costs, which allowed our team to refocus their energy on creating great games.
Yudai Hatasa

We are already seeing
incredible lift and increases in revenue
across our top titles, which allows us to invest more in user acquisition.
Dmitry Shelengovskiy
CEO, Playgendary
“
AppLovin made it easy to migrate to MAX and we saw immediate improvements by switching, including a 30% ARPDAU lift on iOS. We were surprised to achieve this much of an improvement without additional optimizations. And even after, the AppLovin team continued to help us with additional tools, integrations, and testing, which drove our total revenue even higher.
