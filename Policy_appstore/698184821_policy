The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information transmitted to that network.
6.10. Push Notifications. Some of our games and mobile applications may send local notifications to a user’s device; however, local notifications operate differently from “push” notifications. Specifically, local notifications are messages delivered directly through the game or mobile application and do not require collection or use of your personal information (other than the use of device ID, if necessary, solely for the purpose of sending the local notification). Please note that you may opt-out of receiving local notifications by changing your device settings.

We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.
8. SECURITY.
8.1. Security Measures. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.

7.3. Accessing and Correcting Your Information. If you have an account, you can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account or by emailing us at privacy@bluebear.ie. For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose including requesting that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.
8. SECURITY.
8.1. Security Measures. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.
8.2. No Security Guarantees. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
9. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES. If you are a California resident, you may have certain additional rights.
9.1. Privacy Rights. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits registered users who are minors to request and obtain deletion of certain posted content. To make any such requests, please email us at privacy@bluebear.ie or contact us at the address below.
9.2. Do Not Track Disclosures. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “Do Not Track” browser settings. We do not currently take action to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.
