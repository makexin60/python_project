. For security reasons, we can't deal with your request if we’re not sure of your identity, so we may ask you for proof of ID.
‍
Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors. Sometimes, we won’t be able to agree to your request (for example, if we have a legitimate reason for not doing so or the right does not apply to the particular information we hold about you). If you object to us using personal data which we need in order to provide our Services, we may need to close your account as we won’t be able to provide the Services to you.
