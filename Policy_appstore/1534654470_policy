Affiliates
. Note that sometimes we receive information from and share information among the Lyra entities.
Other Lyra Users.
Some of Lyra’s Services, such as Lyra Gather, may allow you to communicate with other Lyra Users, in which case our Services facilitate the direct disclosure of personal information from you to such other Lyra users at your direction.
Service Providers.
We disclose your personal information to our third-party service providers, such as IT and related services, payment processors, customer service providers, and other vendors that support our provision of the Services.

De-identified and Aggregated Information.
We may share de-identified and aggregated information (such as de-identified usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with third parties who help us understand the usage patterns for certain Services and those of our partners.

YOUR CHOICES
There is no law or contract between you and us stating that individuals in the EEA, Switzerland, or UK have to use our Services. We ask you to provide your name, organization, and eligibility information to verify your eligibility to receive certain Services from us, certain essential details about yourself and your lifestyle in an intake form and initial questionnaire so that we may recommend Providers and a coaching program to you, and your payment details to administer our late-cancellation and no-show policies. We cannot provide you with a recommendation or access to coaching services unless you provide such information.

You do not have to consent to our use of personal data for advertising purposes. If you do not allow us to collect the data we automatically collect from users of our Services, some of our Services may not work properly or be as tailored to you as they could otherwise be, but they will still generally be usable.

DATA RETENTION
See Section 6 for information on Lyra’s data retention practices. Generally, your personal data will be stored by us/our service providers only to the extent necessary for the performance of our obligations and strictly for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal data is collected. Afterwards, we will securely destroy or delete your personal data unless we need to retain information, including personal data, to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which we are subject (which can result from, e.g., the Commercial Code or the Tax Code and usually contain retention periods from 6 to 10 years, or if we need it to preserve evidence within the statutes of limitation, which is usually 3 years but can be up to 30 years).

THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) provides standards for how medical information should be used and disclosed by healthcare providers, health plans, and other covered entities. Lyra Clinical Associates P.C. (“LCA”) is a health care provider that both directly delivers health care services through its personnel as well as contracts with licensed providers to deliver health care services. We provide each of our users with this information and ask each of our users to acknowledge receipt of our HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices for LCA, which discloses our practices for personal information gathering and dissemination. Please note that by registering on the website (the “Site”) or by using the services provided by LCA, together with any independent contracted affiliates (together “LCA”, “we”, “our” or “us”), you accept the practices described in this Notice of Privacy Practices. If you do not agree to this Notice, please do not use the Site or Lyra’s services. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE OR RESIDE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS OUR SITE.
What information do we collect from users and how is it used?
Registration
. Before using some of our services, we need you to register with the Site and provide your name, email address, a password, and other personal details. We request this information for identification purposes, to communicate with you, and to improve the functioning of certain services. By providing us with your email address, you consent to receiving information from us through the email you provide us, including protected health information which is private to you and protected by HIPAA. For more information on the information we collect, you can also review our
Terms of Use
(www.lyrahealth.com/terms-of-use/),
Privacy Policy
(www.lyrahealth.com/privacy-policy/), and
Consent to Use Personal Email
(www.lyrahealth.com/email-consent/). You may also be asked to complete other forms (e.g. intake forms, informed consent, etc.) depending on the services you choose.
Forms
. To fully use our offerings, you may need to fill out forms that ask for or contain personal information such as your name, contact information, health, and other personal information. By providing us with your mobile phone number, you consent to receiving information from us by text or voicemail, including in the case of voicemail, protected health information.
Medical Records
. In order for us to get you the best care, we
may
ask you to provide us with your medical records, for which we will obtain a signed authorization from you. We may also ask you for a description of symptoms, a medical history, lifestyle descriptions and information on the progress of your treatment from your provider either over the phone, by email, or through our Site. In addition, if you see a provider that is employed by LCA, we will maintain a medical record that contains the details of the care you receive from LCA.
Correspondence
. If you correspond with us via email or text, we may gather in a file specific to you the information that you submit.
Recordings
. If you contact our care team by videoconference, phone or by email, we may record and retain copies of the interaction for, among other things, ongoing quality assurance, training, and development of our services. If you access any apps or other services we offer, we may record your interactions with our software or our providers. We will inform you if we are recording your interactions with our care team or providers and, if you do not wish to be recorded, you can let the care team or provider know at that time. We may retain some information from the interactions in a fully de-identified and anonymized format for longer than 2 weeks for ongoing quality assurance, training, and development of our services.
Outcomes
. We may periodically send you surveys to collect your feedback on the outcomes of your therapy. Understanding outcomes is central to our mission of providing effective, evidence-based care, and data can help inform Lyra’s approach to treatment and assessment of progress. In addition, LCA uses aggregated, de-identified outcomes data to provide our customers with insight into how their employees are coping better with stressors and functioning at a higher level. We anonymize and convert individual outcome scores into improvement levels, and then aggregate those in reporting across an entire population.
We will store the above described categories of information for as long as needed to provide our services, and as required to comply with our legal obligations (including those under HIPAA), resolve potential or actual disputes, improve the quality of our services, or enforce our agreements.
In addition, your provider may capture independent clinical and psychotherapy notes, which would be subject to his or her separate HIPAA privacy practices.
How does LCA use and disclose protected health information about you that we collect?
LCA will collect protected health information (“PHI”), which includes but may not be limited to your name, age, gender, contact information, problems you are seeking help for, and progress and outcomes of your treatment, from you and will use or share it for the following purposes:
Treatment
. We can use your PHI and share it with other professionals or programs that are treating you, such as when you are referred to another mental health professional for further treatment. By using our services, you hereby explicitly consent to the sharing of information like your name, age, gender, problems you are seeking help for, including alcohol and substance use, care preferences, health plan coverage, and progress of your treatment with current and potential therapists to promote good outcomes.
Run our Organization
. We can use and share your PHI to support our business operations, that is to run our organization, improve our offerings to clients, improve your care and the coordination of your care, and contact you when necessary, such as using your PHI to manage your treatment and services. We may also use de-identified information that we retain for these purposes.
Billing and Payment
. We may use and share your PHI to confirm eligibility for services and to ensure proper payment to providers. For example, we may request your information from your health plan or employer in order to confirm eligibility for services.
Other Uses
. We are allowed or required to share your information in other ways – usually in ways that contribute to the public good, such as public health and research. We have to meet many conditions in the law before we can share your information for these purposes. For more information see:
“Your Rights Under HIPAA”
. The following are ways we may share your information:
Help with public health and safety issues
: We can share health information about you for certain situations such as reporting suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic violence; preventing or reducing a serious threat to anyone’s health or safety; reporting adverse reactions to medications; preventing disease; and helping with product recalls.
Do research

Respond to organ and tissue donation requests

Respond to lawsuits and legal actions

You have both the right and the choice to tell us to share your PHI with your family, close friends, or others involved in your care; share your PHI in a disaster relief situation; and whether to contact you for fundraising efforts. If you are not able to tell us your preference, we may go ahead and share your information if we believe it is in
your
best interest.
We will never share your PHI, unless you give us written permission to, for marketing purposes, for sale of your information, and for any sharing of psychotherapy notes. You may revoke or restrict the authorization to disclose your PHI for these purposes at any time.
Lyra reserves the right to release collected information to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.
What are your rights regarding your protected health information?
You have certain rights regarding protected health information that we maintain about you, including rights to:

here
.
Get a list of those with whom we’ve shared information
. You can ask for a list (accounting) of the times we’ve shared your health information for 6 years prior to the date you ask, who we shared it with, and why. We will include all disclosures except for those about treatment, payment, and health care operations, and certain other disclosures (such as any you asked us to make).

What are LCA’s responsibilities with my information?
We are required by federal law (HIPAA) and state law (e.g. CMIA in California) to maintain the privacy and security of your protected health information. We will let you know promptly if a breach occurs that may have compromised the privacy or security of your protected health information. We must follow the duties and privacy practices described in this notice and give you a copy of it. We will not use or share your information other than as described here unless you tell us we can in writing. If you tell us we can, you may change your mind at any time. Let us know in writing if you change your mind. For more information see:
“Notice of Privacy Practices”
.
In some circumstances, our customers who sponsor the services offered by LCA may have requested further limitations on our use and disclosure of PHI than those scenarios described in this Notice. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between this Notice and the terms of any agreements we have entered into with our customers or any applicable employer-sponsored group health plan privacy policy, the terms of those documents will control.
How will I know about changes in the Notice of Privacy Practices?
LCA reserves the right to update this Notice of Privacy Practices from time to time. Please visit this page periodically so that you will be apprised of any changes. The policies indicated in this Notice will remain effective, even if you are no longer using our Site or services.
At times, LCA may work with a third party contracted provider to deliver services to you. To the extent that there is a conflict between LCA’s Notice of Privacy Practices and that of a third party contracted provider regarding how your PHI will handled, the Notice of Privacy Practices that is more restrictive regarding the use, access and disclosure of your PHI will apply.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
