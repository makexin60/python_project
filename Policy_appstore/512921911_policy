We will tell you how long we keep data and what happens when we no longer need it. We will also outline what rights you have over your data and how we protect and facilitate those rights.
Opting in and out of communications made easy
Sometimes people want to read privacy notices because a business is asking for their permission to contact them for marketing. They want to be sure that, if they agree, it will be easy for them to withdraw permission in the future. We want you to be able to opt out as easily as you opted in. Any marketing email we send you will always have an "unsubscribe" link that will take you off that relevant marketing list. Please remember that you may have subscribed from another email address; you will only be able to use the link to "unsubscribe" from the address to which the marketing email has been sent. We make it easy for you to change your preferences for postal marketing as well, giving clear instructions for opting out on all direct mail.
If you want to change the preferences you have with us for email or for postal marketing, you can use our online form

If you do not have an email address associated with us, and you want to make a request to opt in or out of postal marketing you can do so with this

Sometimes, we may collect data in online surveys on what is called "special categories of data". These could be data sets such as biometric information (including voice samples, facial recognition, etc), or political opinions, religion, philosophical beliefs, health, sexual orientation, etc. Whenever we conduct research on these topics, it is always optional, and we will make sure we have your consent to process this data. We will remind you at the time of why and how we are processing this data and what additional safeguards are in place for using, storing and ultimately either deleting or anonymising this data.
2. How do we use your personal information?
At Condé Nast Britain we collect different types of information about people for four main reasons:
To provide personalised services unique to individual users.
So we can monitor and improve the services we offer and keep our websites secure.
To sell advertising space and display ads on our websites (these will only be personalised ads where you have opted into the appropriate cookies) and to combat ad-related fraud. This helps us to keep our websites free for people who visit them.
To market products and services which we think would be relevant to you.
Newsletters
When you sign up to one of our newsletters, you are giving consent for us to use the email address provided to send you relevant content for the brands you have signed up to. You can withdraw this consent for any newsletter by unsubscribing at any time.
Advertising
We advertise on our site and in our newsletters to help keep most of the content free. We use cookies and similar technologies and work with trusted partners so that we can show you advertisements we believe might interest you, to control the number of times you see an ad and to measure the effectiveness of a campaign. If you are interested and want to learn more about these, including how to opt out, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Please note, opting out of cookies does not mean you will not see any advertisements. We work with advertising partners including Google to deliver and present non-personalised ads to our website visitors that have not opted into the appropriate cookies. To do this we use your IP address, information about the browser and operating system you are using to access the site, the language you are using, and the date and time of your visit.
Security and fixing errors
When you visit our website, we use your IP address, information about the browser and operating system you are using to access the site, the language you are using, and the date and time of your visit to ensure security and fix errors on our site, and to prevent and detect fraud.
Social Media Advertising
We work with social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter to show you marketing content from our brands and selected advertisers if you have viewed a Condé Nast website and to make sure what we show you on these platforms is relevant to you. Data collected by these social media networks may also be anonymised and used in aggregate to help improve the quality and effectiveness of our websites and marketing efforts.
You can limit this kind of tracking and profiling by going to your account settings of Facebook and/or Twitter. You can also find out more about the pixels and cookies we use on our websites by reading our
Cookies policy
.
We may also participate in Facebook's 'Custom Audience' service from time to time. This service enables Condé Nast to display to you personalised advertisements when you visit Facebook’s social media platforms. It works by converting your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers that Facebook generates from email addresses of its users. Where we use Facebook Custom Audiences, we will only include you if you have consented to receive marketing from us. If you have given us your consent, you can change your mind at any time by unsubscribing (linked in any email we send you) or by adjusting your preferences in our
preference centre
.
Research & Insight
We run various user communities, forums and reader panels. We send out research invitations to our research communities, to people who pay for our products and services and to people who have opted in to receive communications from us.
We may sometimes use your gender and age range collected during a survey for building "look-a-like" models. This data is anonymously transmitted to our Data Management Platform (Permutive) and matched with our subscribers and members. This allows us to provide relevant and targeted advertising. If you are interested and want to learn more about these, including how to opt out, please see our
Cookie Policy
. Please note, opting out of cookies does not mean you will not see any advertisements.
Delivery of goods and services / Customer account management
We will use the information you have provided for the provision of goods and/or services that you have requested and subsequently communicating with you about those products and services.
Please note too, that when you buy something from us - such as subscription or a ticket to an event - we may contact you about your registration details, to manage any account or subscription you have with us, or to provide customer service. This will be the case even if you have opted-out of, or declined to consent to, receiving promotional emails.
Competitions
When you enter one of our online competitions, we will process your information for the purposes of picking a winner. If you have opted-in to receiving information from us about our products and services (eg receiving subscriptions offers, event invitations, signing up for editorial newsletters etc) then we will use the information you provide to make sure we offer you relevant products and services (based on where you live, your age, gender, tastes, preferences etc). If you have opted-in to receive news and offers from any competition sponsors, we will share your information with them.
Further details about this is outlined in the "who do we share information with" with section.
Partnerships programmes
We work with our partners from the world of luxury goods, fashion, travel and retail so that we can present you with some outstanding offers and opportunities by either email or post. You will only ever receive partner messages from us if you have actively given permission. We won’t disclose your personal information to anyone, the messages will come from us and you can unsubscribe at any time from these messages.
Customer queries and complaints
We process any information you provide when dealing with any complaints or enquiries made by you or legally on your behalf.
3. Legal bases for data processing – what does it mean and how do we use them?
The law on data protection sets out several different reasons why a company may collect and process your personal data and it is one of our duties to make sure you understand which of these lawful bases we are using to process your data.
Consent
In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent:
When you sign up to any editorial newsletter
When you tick a box to receive email from Condé Nast about news and offers
When you tick a box to consent to receive email from Condé Nast on behalf of our partners
We send SMS messages, either from Condé Nast or on behalf of our partners with your consent
When you give us your details to enter a competition
When you participate in any research, this is with your consent
Legitimate interest
In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests:
To deliver and present non-personalised advertising on our websites – we rely on our legitimate interests in selling ad space so that we can keep our websites free for people who visit them
We personalise the marketing content we provide you
If you have bought a product or service from us, we will also use your details to send you direct marketing information by email or post, telling you about products and services that we think might interest you
If you have bought a product or service from us we will send you direct marketing on behalf of our partners
To ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors on our website – we rely on our legitimate interests in protecting and administering our business We will only use legitimate interest after we have properly evaluated the data processing and conducted a necessary balancing test. We will also give data subjects the right to object to the processing at any time.
Contractual obligations
In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.
For example, when you purchase a print subscription to a magazine, we will keep your name and address to fulfil your subscription.
Legal compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.
For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting us to law enforcement.
4. Do we share your information with anyone else?
Condé Nast International and its subsidiaries
We may share your personal information:
With our parent company, Condé Nast International
If all or any of our assets (eg a title owned by us) were to be sold to another business, the personal data relating to that title (eg the subscriber list / newsletter list etc) would be transferred to the new business owner.
Service providers
We work with service providers to perform some tasks on our behalf. This might include analysis, payments, marketing, identity management, IT services. This may include personal information and non-personal site usage information to provide aggregate demographics on our audiences. We may share your personal data with these providers to perform the necessary tasks. However, they are obliged not to disclose or use it for any other purposes. Any third-party processing of your data on our behalf will be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this privacy notice and applicable law.
Customer research & insight
We may disclose de-personalised data (such as aggregated statistics) about the audience of our products and services and/or research participants to describe our sales, customers, traffic patterns and other information to prospective partners, advertisers, investors and other reputable third parties, and for other lawful purposes. These statistics will never include identifiable personal information.
Law enforcement organisations
Under certain circumstances we may occasionally be required by law, court order or governmental authority to disclose certain types of personal information and we reserve the right to comply with any such legally binding request.
Marketing partners
With your explicit permission, we may share your information with other companies we are working with, such as competition sponsors. Whenever we share your information with another company, we will always ask for your permission, will name the company and will always be clear that your information will be shared with another organisation.
Other advertising partners
When you visit our website, and only for the purpose of serving you adverts on our website, we share your IP address, information about your browser and operating system, the language you are using, and the date and time of your visit with our advertising partners such as Google.
5. Collecting data on children
We do not knowingly collect and process information from children (anyone under the age of 13). The products and services we offer are generally aimed at people aged 18 and over.
If you are under the age of 13, we ask that you do not give us any information about you or use our websites.

To unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing email and update your account preferences. You may also use our
preference centre

Your rights
’ below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
7. Profiling
We may sometimes use the data you share with us, and that we collect about you when browsing our websites and products, to personalise our services and to tailor marketing content. For example, we may use information you have provided to send you information about products we think you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive this material, you can unsubscribe at any point.
8. Cross-border transfers and security
We make sure that we have appropriate security measures to protect your information and make sure that, when we ask another organisation to provide a service for us, they have appropriate security measures and follow the same high standards of security and data protection as we do.
If we or our service providers transfer any information out of the European Economic Area (EEA), it will only be done with the relevant protection (stated under UK law) being in place.

Notice to California Customers - Your Privacy Rights
A. Consumer Privacy.
The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et. seq. ("CCPA"), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described in this Section X(A).
California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Notice Coordinator by email at
datacontroller@condenast.co.uk
or phone at +1 888-914-9661, PIN: 867 610, or as described at the end of this document:
Know the ways in which we acquire, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information
Know the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold
Request the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions, and
Not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights
California residents also have the right to opt-out of the "sale" of their Personal Information. We put "sale" in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as "sales," even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. If we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information. Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren’t "sales," such as with our Service Providers.
Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your Personal Information for a "business purpose" (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:
Identifiers
Protected characteristics
Commercial information
Geolocation data
Internet or other electronic network activity information
Financial, medical, or health insurance information
Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information
Professional information
Education information
Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.
Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have "sold" (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:
Identifiers
Protected characteristics
Commercial information
Geolocation data
Internet or other electronic network activity information
Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories, along with the following categories: (i) financial, medical, or health insurance information; (ii) audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information; (iii) professional information, and (iv) education information.
B. Shine the Light.
California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent our disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.
C. Online Erasure.
California’s "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of Content they post. If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Service that is directed to minors, you may request removal of the Content by contacting our Privacy Notice Coordinator by email at datacontroller@condenast.co.uk or as described at the end of this document. In response to your request, we may elect to make the Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the Content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the Content.

3. Legal bases for data processing – what does it mean and how do we use them?
The law on data protection sets out several different reasons why a company may collect and process your personal data and it is one of our duties to make sure you understand which of these lawful bases we are using to process your data.
Consent
In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent:
When you sign up to any editorial newsletter
When you tick a box to receive email from Condé Nast about news and offers
When you tick a box to consent to receive email from Condé Nast on behalf of our partners
We send SMS messages, either from Condé Nast or on behalf of our partners with your consent
When you give us your details to enter a competition
When you participate in any research, this is with your consent
Legitimate interest
In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests:
To deliver and present non-personalised advertising on our websites – we rely on our legitimate interests in selling ad space so that we can keep our websites free for people who visit them
We personalise the marketing content we provide you
If you have bought a product or service from us, we will also use your details to send you direct marketing information by email or post, telling you about products and services that we think might interest you
If you have bought a product or service from us we will send you direct marketing on behalf of our partners
To ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors on our website – we rely on our legitimate interests in protecting and administering our business We will only use legitimate interest after we have properly evaluated the data processing and conducted a necessary balancing test. We will also give data subjects the right to object to the processing at any time.
Contractual obligations
In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.
For example, when you purchase a print subscription to a magazine, we will keep your name and address to fulfil your subscription.
Legal compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.
For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting us to law enforcement.
4. Do we share your information with anyone else?
Condé Nast International and its subsidiaries
We may share your personal information:
With our parent company, Condé Nast International
If all or any of our assets (eg a title owned by us) were to be sold to another business, the personal data relating to that title (eg the subscriber list / newsletter list etc) would be transferred to the new business owner.
Service providers
We work with service providers to perform some tasks on our behalf. This might include analysis, payments, marketing, identity management, IT services. This may include personal information and non-personal site usage information to provide aggregate demographics on our audiences. We may share your personal data with these providers to perform the necessary tasks. However, they are obliged not to disclose or use it for any other purposes. Any third-party processing of your data on our behalf will be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this privacy notice and applicable law.
Customer research & insight
We may disclose de-personalised data (such as aggregated statistics) about the audience of our products and services and/or research participants to describe our sales, customers, traffic patterns and other information to prospective partners, advertisers, investors and other reputable third parties, and for other lawful purposes. These statistics will never include identifiable personal information.
Law enforcement organisations
Under certain circumstances we may occasionally be required by law, court order or governmental authority to disclose certain types of personal information and we reserve the right to comply with any such legally binding request.
Marketing partners
With your explicit permission, we may share your information with other companies we are working with, such as competition sponsors. Whenever we share your information with another company, we will always ask for your permission, will name the company and will always be clear that your information will be shared with another organisation.
Other advertising partners

Notice to California Customers - Your Privacy Rights
A. Consumer Privacy.
The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et. seq. ("CCPA"), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described in this Section X(A).
California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Notice Coordinator by email at
datacontroller@condenast.co.uk
or phone at +1 888-914-9661, PIN: 867 610, or as described at the end of this document:
Know the ways in which we acquire, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information
Know the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold
Request the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions, and
Not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights
California residents also have the right to opt-out of the "sale" of their Personal Information. We put "sale" in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as "sales," even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. If we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information. Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren’t "sales," such as with our Service Providers.
Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your Personal Information for a "business purpose" (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:
Identifiers
Protected characteristics
Commercial information
Geolocation data
Internet or other electronic network activity information
Financial, medical, or health insurance information
Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information
Professional information
Education information
Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.
Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have "sold" (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:
Identifiers
Protected characteristics
Commercial information
Geolocation data
Internet or other electronic network activity information
Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories, along with the following categories: (i) financial, medical, or health insurance information; (ii) audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information; (iii) professional information, and (iv) education information.
B. Shine the Light.
California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent our disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.
C. Online Erasure.
California’s "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of Content they post. If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Service that is directed to minors, you may request removal of the Content by contacting our Privacy Notice Coordinator by email at datacontroller@condenast.co.uk or as described at the end of this document. In response to your request, we may elect to make the Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the Content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the Content.

4. Tracking Techniques and Technologies and Targeted Advertising
Tracking Techniques and Technologies
We and our third-party business partners use various tools and technologies such as cookies, pixels, localStorage, web beacons, software development kits, and similar technologies (collectively, “
Tracking Technologies
”) to collect data when you interact with our Products and Services, including our websites, mobile applications, and email communications. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).
Our Products and Services use Tracking Technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website can access Personal Information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Product or Service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Products and Services, such as pages you have visited, and Content you viewed or searched for. We may also use these technologies to save your preferences, consent, and choices; determine if you opened or interacted with our emails or newsletters; troubleshoot and resolve technical issues or outages; conduct research; deliver editorial Content and advertising; maintain subscription and registration information; and store information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis. Additionally, we may use these technologies to collect analytics and measure the use of our Products and Services.
The use of these Tracking Technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you are interested in, track trends, measure the effectiveness of ads, conduct frequency capping, and tailor offers about our Products and Services to you. We also allow specific, approved third-party business partners and/or service providers, including Google Analytics, to collect data from your browser or device for Targeted Advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes using their own similar tools. For more information about Google Analytics including how to opt out, visit
How Google Uses Information
and to
Opt-out of Google Analytics
.
We and our third-party business partners may also use these Tracking Technologies to gather Personal Information, including Sensitive Personal Information, about how you view and use our Products and Services and to connect your activity with other data we maintain about you.
Targeted Advertising and Identity Resolution Partners
We and our third-party business partners may collect and share Personal Information about your online and offline activities over time and across unaffiliated websites and mobile applications to predict your preferences and interests, and, in conjunction with third parties, may use your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising and to serve advertising believed to be of interest to you ("
Targeted Advertising
").
We may collaborate with our service providers and our third-party
Identity Resolution Partners
to deliver Targeted Advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Products and Services. We and these
Identity Resolution Partners
facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use Personal Information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity and Device Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser.
For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, who may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, to enforce our User Agreement, verify user authentication for accessing Content behind a paywall, and to determine eligibility for offers available exclusively to new subscribers, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can Opt-Out of Identity Resolution Partner LiveRamp’s use of your Personal Information for these purposes by visiting

When we obtain this information from our third-party business partners, we will, where required by law, contractually ensure that they have obtained your consent or offered you an opportunity to opt out before sharing it with us. Similarly, if we collect Sensitive Personal Information directly from you, where required by law, we will obtain your consent, provide you an opportunity to opt out, or take other appropriate action.
