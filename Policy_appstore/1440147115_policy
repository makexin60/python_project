Right to Data Portability, that is, to receive the Personal Information that you provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You have the right to transmit this Information to another service provider. Where technically feasible, you have the right that your Personal Information be transmitted directly from us to the service provider you designate.
Right to Withdraw Consent to processing your Personal Information, at any time, where the processing is based on consent.

Right to Object, based on your particular situation, to using your Personal Information on the basis of our legitimate interests. However, we may override the objection if we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You may also object at any time to the use of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.
Right to Restrict processing your Personal Information (except for storing it) if you contest the accuracy of your Personal Information, for a period enabling us to verify its accuracy; if you believe that the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Information and request instead to restrict its use; if we no longer need the Personal Information for the purposes outlined in this Policy, but you require them to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or if you object to processing, pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds for processing overrides yours.
Right to be Forgotten. Under certain circumstances, such as when your right to object overrides our legitimate interests, you have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Information. However, we may still process your Personal Information if it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, we are subject to under laws in EU Member States or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
