														procedures stipulated in the internal regulations, and to make
														appropriate decisions and responses.

We may outsource all or part of the handling of personal
														information to the extent necessary to achieve the purpose of
														use set forth in Article 4 "Purpose of Use and Scope of
														Collection." In that case, we will strictly select a contractor
