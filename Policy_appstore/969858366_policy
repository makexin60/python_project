Verification information
. To create and maintain a trusted community, we can collect verification information, including a phone number and e-mail address.
Payment information

to provide us with payment information, such as a bank account or credit card information to facilitate the processing of payments.
Communication with other platform users
. When you communicate with other Babysits users via our messaging system, we collect information about your communications and all information that you want to provide.

On your Babysits profile we also show you your Facebook friends who actively use Babysits as well.
Document control
: We enable users to provide a Criminal Registration Check (or local equivalent). As soon as Babysits has assessed the document, it is removed from our servers.
ID verification
. Identity verification is one of the ways we keep Babysits safe. This helps us check that youâ€™re really you. We may collect your facial imagery, ID-number, date of birth, first name, last name, middle name, document type, document issuing country, nationality and address, as well as sophisticated fraud signals and information about the devices that connect with our services. To pay babysitters we may share babysitter IDs with our payment provider Stripe due to regulatory and financial partner requirements. Facial recognition data is processed by our service provider; Amazon Web Services (AWS). The pictures of your ID-document will not be stored by Babysits after the verification is completed and this may take up to 1 week.
Matched Identifier Communications
. To enhance our online advertising effectiveness, we may share privacy-protected contact information with third-party platforms. This helps us measure ad performance and may be used to send or withhold promotional messages to individuals on these third-party platforms. Privacy protection involves converting identifiable details (like email addresses or phone numbers) into a secure format to prevent revealing the original information. The third-party matches this data against its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Babysits and the third party. If there is a match, Babysits can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising.
