            Information such as your name and email address. You can choose not

            to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We
            may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be
            individually identified.

            your IP address, browser version and type, "cookie"
            information, and the page you requested. Usage Data: When you visit
            the Website, whether as a Vero customer or a non-registered user
            just browsing, our servers automatically record information that
            your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log
            Data"). For example, Log Data may include information such as

            features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such
            third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Notice

3. Privacy for our Services
This section describes how we collect and use information we receive
            when you use our Services.
3.1 What information do we collect and how do we use it?
We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as
            explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to
            personalize and improve the Services, to allow our users to set up a
            user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests
            for the Services and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Notice.
            We may share certain types of Personal Information with third
            parties (described in this Section and in Section 4.1 below).
a. Information you provide to us:
Your Personal Information: We receive and store any information you
            knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal
            Information such as your name and email address. You can choose not
            to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able
            to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
            Your Customers' Personal Information: In order to provide you with
            the Services, we also receive and store any information you choose
            to provide us with in respect to your customers ("End
            Users"). The End User information ("End User Data")
            we receive and store typically includes names and email addresses of
            your customers, but will consist of any information you choose to
            provide us with.
b. Information collected automatically:
Usage Data: we automatically collect certain data relating to the
            performance and configuration of our Service and our customers' and
            our customers' end users' consumption and use of, and interaction
            with, the Service ("Usage Data"). Usage Data is generally
            technical information or data obtained from APIs, product software
            or systems hosting the products and services, devices accessing
            these products and services and solutions and/or log files generated
            during such use but may also include information such as IP
            addresses (which may in some jurisdictions be considered personal
            information). Such Usage Data is used for Vero to maintain and
            operate the Service and separately, to analyze and improve the
            Service. Usage Data does not include any customer or end user
            content stored in the Service. End User Data: as part of our
            provision of the Services to you, if you install the API libraries
            and other software code provided by us on your website, we will also
            track and collect End User usage information on your website.
c. Information we obtain from third parties
We also use third parties to collect information relating to you
            using Clearbit, CRM and similar services. For more information on
            how we share information, please see section 4.1 below.
4. General Information
4.1 Will Vero share any of the personal information it
                receives?
We neither rent nor sell your or your End User Customers' Personal
            Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share such
            Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third
            parties as described below.
a. Trusted Third Parties:
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf
            and need to share your information with them to provide the Services
            to you. Unless we tell you differently, such third parties do not
            have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them
            beyond what is necessary to assist us. This includes third party
            companies and individuals employed by us to facilitate our Services,
            including the provision of maintenance services, database
            management, web analytics and general improvement of the Services. A
            list of our current Trusted Third Parties can be found
here
.
b. Business transfers:
We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,
            customer information is typically one of the business assets that is
            transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are
            acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go
            through some other change of control, Personal Information would be
            one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party, in
            which case such party will use your Personal Information in line
            with this Privacy Notice.
c. Protection of Vero and others:
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
            information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with
            law or a court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and
            other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
            Vero, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
            information with other companies and organizations for fraud
            protection and credit risk reduction.
d. With your consent:
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal
            Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to
            prevent the sharing of this information.
4.2 Legal basis for processing Personal Information (EEA
                visitors only)
If you are a visitor/customer located in the European Economic Area
            ("EEA"), Vero Holdings Australia Pty Ltd is the data
            controller of your Personal Information. Our legal basis for
            collecting and using the Personal Information described above will
            depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific
            context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect
            Personal Information only where we have your consent to do so, where
            we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or
            where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not
            overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights
            and freedoms.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to
            collect Personal Information from you. If we ask you to provide
            Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to
            perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant
            time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal
            Information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible
            consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information).
            Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in
            reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we
            will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate
            interests are. For more information on the legal basis for
            processing your information please contact us at
dataprivacy@getvero.com
or through our Registered Agent in the European Union at
getvero@lionheartsquared.eu
.
4.3 Where we store your personal information
Vero has its headquarters and the majority of its operations in
            Australia.  If you interact with, join or share your data with Vero
            in any of the ways explained in this Privacy Notice then, if you are
            not also in Australia, your Personal Information may be transferred
            to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you
            are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are
            different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be
            as protective. Specifically, our servers are located in the United
            States, and our group companies and service providers operate in the
            United States, Australia and Singapore. This means that when we
            collect your Personal Information we may process it in any of these
            countries. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require
            that Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with
            this Privacy Notice.
4.4 Is the personal information secure?
Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and
            security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and
            Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password
            appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and
            browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your
            account. We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to
            protect the Personal Information that we collect and process. The
            measures we use are designed to provide a level of security
            appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Information.
            Specific measures we use include encrypting Personal Information in
            transit and at rest, the implementation of an internal security
            policy and access control measures for all team members, the use of
            firewalls and other threat detection technologies, regular backups
            for data recovery. Whilst we endeavor to protect the privacy of your
            account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, we
            cannot guarantee complete security. The transmission of information
            via the Internet is not completely secure. Unauthorized entry or
            use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise
            the security of user information at any time. The Website may
            contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy
            policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to
            another site you should read that site's Privacy Notice.
4.5 What personal information can I access?

              processing grounds other than consent.

            mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take

            update, or delete information as explained in Section 4.5 above.

            by adjusting the settings using our Preference Center.
4.7 Data retention and deletion
We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an
            ongoing legitimate business need to do so, (for example, to provide
            you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable
            legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing
            legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we
            will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for
            example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup
            archives, then we will securely store your Personal Information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
4.8 Changes to this Privacy Notice

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

We also ask you to create a password and name your account (or accounts, if you have more than one).
Customer Account Data -
We process certain personal data to manage our relationship with you and administer you or your company’s account.

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
Depending on the data protection laws applicable to you, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data that we process as a data controller:
that we provide details about the categories of personal data that we collect about you, including how we collect and share it;
that we provide you access to, and a copy of, the personal data we collect about you;
that we update or correct any inaccurate personal data we have about you;
that we delete the personal data we have about you;
that we restrict processing of personal data about you;
that we provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit that information to another controller, and where feasible, transmit the information directly;
that we provide you with the right to object to the processing of personal data, including profiling;
that we provide you with a free, easy mechanism to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes;
that you not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects or similarly affects your individual rights;
to withdraw your consent; and
to complain to a competent supervisory authority and/or to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Twilio will honor your rights subject to limitations in certain situations, such as where Twilio can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement or legitimate interest to process your data or can legitimately apply an exemption to the exercise of a right under applicable law. More information about these rights can be found in our Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy
Rule 10
and
Appendix 3

If you are a
US resident

Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.

You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.

How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification
In some instances, we will need to verify your identity before honoring your request. We will generally verify your identity by asking you to provide personal data related to your recent interactions with us. Thereafter, we will process your request and inform you of any decisions we have made about your request.  Additionally, you may exercise your privacy rights through an authorized agent. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
.
We won’t discriminate against you or change the price of our services if you make a request, but if you ask us to delete your data, it may affect your ability to use our Services.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
As an individual Twilio account holder or as an authorized representative of a Twilio customer in the US, you have the right to restrict Twilio’s use of
CPNI
. To opt-out of the use of CPNI data related to your Twilio account to market other Twilio Services based on your usage of our Services, click
here
.  Please note that, if you have subscribed for the services on behalf of an organization, the CPNI relates to the service usage by that organization and not you individually. Opting-out of the use of CPNI for marketing will not unsubscribe you from other types of marketing contacts from Twilio and will not affect the status of the services you currently have with us. Your approval or opt-out of the use of your CPNI outside of the services to which you are already subscribed is valid until you affirmatively revoke or limit such approval.
Communication Preferences
You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time through your marketing preferences page by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any marketing email you receive from Twilio. You can also
update your communication preferences
using our online form or contact our
Customer Support
Team to communicate your choice to opt out. Please note that it may take up to three days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request. You will not be able to opt out of service emails from us, such as password reset emails, billing emails, or notifications of updates to our terms, unless you deactivate your account.
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Twilio uses common information gathering tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels and other similar tracking technologies to automatically collect information as you navigate our websites, your account or when you interact with emails we send to you.

To learn more about each category of cookie, you can visit our cookie consent tool by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting.
Manage Your Cookie Preferences

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s
documentation
and Segment’s
documentation
to find more detailed information about managing personal data collected and stored in connection with their use of our Services. We also provide an overview of our retention and deletion practices, including how to delete data you control in our

Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) (together with our Terms and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us and how you can get access to this information. If in doubt, the primary governing law of this policy is that of the state of Victoria, Australia.
1. Purpose of this Policy
Mindset Health provides you (the “User”) with access to the online and mobile services associated with Mindset, including but not limited to, mindsethealth.com and all associated subdomains (the “Website”), and the Mindset & Nerva mobile applications (the “App”), collectively the “System”.
Our privacy policy is written to be compliant with numerous national and international laws and frameworks, including (but not limited to)
HIPAA
,
GDPR
, and the
EU-US Privacy Shield
.
2. Processing your data
What is the purpose of our processing?
We process your data in order to provide program of personalized tools for managing mental health & wellness (and to support the delivery of that program).
What is our legal basis for processing?
We require consent from all users before processing their data. This consent can be
withdrawn
at any time. To request deletion of data, please send an email to hello@mindsethealth.com from the email associated with the data you wish to delete.
What data do we collect?
Personal information
We collect and use information like your name, email address, and phone number to personalize the course and communicate with you. You're able to opt out of any external communications (i.e., email and SMS message) at any time.
Health information
We collect information about your worry and anxiety (including, but not limited to, self-reported symptoms or difficulties associated with  worry, anxiety, mood, sleep, and stress) in order to personalize our program.
We may collect information about pre-existing medical conditions in order to ensure the safety of the worry and anxiety  management program we provide.
We also collect general information about your mental and physical wellbeing in order to evaluate progress against your self-defined goals.
Electronic identifiers
We may collection information about the devices you use to access the System, including (but not limited to) IP address, mobile device UDID and IMEI numbers, operating system, browser type, and screen size. This information is used to provide you with customer support, for system administration, to tailor your experience of the System, to report aggregate information internally, and to assist communication (e.g., push notifications).
Cookies
We may store cookies (small text files managed by your web browser) on your computer in order to improve your experience with the System. Example uses of these cookies include: recognizing you when you return to the System, maintaining data you've entered across multiple sessions, and storing information about your personal preferences.
You may refuse to accept cookies by changing the settings on your device to prevent cookies from being set. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the System. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system may issue cookies when you visit the System.
Non-identifiable information
We may include your data in aggregated data sets shared with our research partners. In these sets, your data is not personally identifiable, and would be used for supporting generalized statements (e.g., "women ages 35-40  working in non-office jobs have the highest levels of worry ").
3. Who has access to that data?
Mindset Health understands that your identifiable health information is private and personal and is dedicated to maintaining its confidentiality and integrity. As such, we will never sell or rent it, and we have policies, procedures, and other safeguards to help protect it from improper use and disclosure.
We follow a Minimum Necessary Access Policy so any required disclosure of your identifiable health information is minimized. The following categories describe the ways in which we use your identifiable health information and the rare instances that require us to disclose it to persons and entities outside of Big Health. We have not listed every use or disclosure within the categories below, but all permitted uses and disclosures will fall within one of the following categories. In addition, there are some uses and disclosures that may require your specific authorization.
Mindset Health does not disclose Personal Information to third parties for any purpose materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected.
Disclosure at your request
We may disclose information relating to your use of the System when requested by you. This disclosure at your request may require written authorization by you.
Payment
We do not store credit card or customer details with any 3rd parties except trusted suppliers who help us deliver the services associated with the System and we are committed to ensuring that all suppliers meet our security and data protection standards. As such, we may use and disclose your identifiable health information to obtain payment for services that we provide to you. For example, we may make disclosures to claim and obtain payment from your health insurer, HMO, or other company that arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your use of the System (“Your Payor”) or to verify that Your Payor will pay for health care.
Services and Operations
We may use and disclose your identifiable health information in connection with providing services, for our internal operations, which include administration, eligibility, planning, analytics and various activities that assess and improve the quality and cost effectiveness of the service that we deliver to you. Examples are using information about you to improve quality of the service, satisfaction surveys, de-identifying health information, customer services and internal training. To the extent you receive access to our Website and App through your employer or your health plan, our services may include supporting, and sharing information with, your employer’s wellness program, your health plan or third-party administrator or other similar programs. Possible information to be shared may include participation data (i.e. the fact that you used Mindset), milestone data (e.g. number of sessions you complete or how many times you practice the techniques) to allow you to earn incentives and rewards (if those are offered as part of your wellness program), as well as data from your initial self-report of worry and anxiety. Information that identifies you as an individual will not be shared with your employer.
Emails
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us, or click on a link in an email, if your computer supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. When you receive an email from us, you can opt out of receiving further emails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. However, by opting out of further email communications after you sign up, you may limit program reminders and other valuable program content and components.
Reminders and notifications
We may use and disclose your identifiable health information to contact you as a reminder to interact with, or complete tasks relating to your use of the System. You may make changes to the format and frequency of these reminders, or cancel these reminders and/or notifications by logging into your Mindset account in the App, and/or by accessing the native notification settings on your mobile device when using the App.
Third party service providers
There are some services provided in our organization through third party services providers. Examples of third party services providers include accounting services, server hosting and email delivery providers, business associates, vendors and other business partners and reputable companies in the industry who subcontract to us or to those of your employer as our corporate customers, where permitted by law. We may disclose your identifiable health information to our third party services providers so that they can perform the job that is required of them. To protect your identifiable health information, we require appropriate contracts or written agreements be in place that safeguard your identifiable health information.
Third party medical professionals
With your explicit permission, we may share your identifiable health information with third party medical professionals nominated by you.
Threat to health or safety
We may use and disclose your identifiable health information when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would only be to someone able to help prevent the threat.
As required by law
Certain laws permit or require certain uses and disclosures of identifiable health information for example, for public health activities, health oversight activities and law enforcement. In these instances, Mindset Health will only use or disclose your identifiable health information to the extent the law requires.
Personal representatives or persons involved with your care
We must use and disclose your identifiable health information to anyone who has the legal right to act for you (your personal representative) in order to administer your rights. We may also use or disclose your identifiable health information to a person involved in your care or who helps pay for your care, such as a family member, when you are incapacitated or in an emergency, or when you agree or fail to object when given the opportunity. If you are unavailable or unable to object, we will use our best judgment to decide if the disclosure is in your best interests. Special rules apply regarding when we may disclose health information to family members and others involved in a deceased individual's care. We may disclose health information to any persons involved, prior to the death, in the care or payment for care of a deceased individual, unless we are aware that doing so would be inconsistent with a preference previously expressed by the deceased.
For research and publicity purposes
We may use identifiable health information for internal and external research and publicity purposes. This may include publishing aggregate information about our users (for example, that women ages 35-40 working in non-office jobs have the highest levels of worry) in the context of providing public health information and conducting academic research. In certain instances, we may only provide such information with special waivers and permissions from you.
Transfer of business assets
In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. If Mindset Health or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets. Mindset Health will ensure that information transferred to third parties will only be used in a way that is compliant with Privacy Shield Principles, and will remain liable in cases of onward transfers to third parties.

The following categories describe the ways in which we use your identifiable health information and the rare instances that require us to disclose it to persons and entities outside of Big Health. We have not listed every use or disclosure within the categories below, but all permitted uses and disclosures will fall within one of the following categories. In addition, there are some uses and disclosures that may require your specific authorization.
Mindset Health does not disclose Personal Information to third parties for any purpose materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected.
Disclosure at your request
We may disclose information relating to your use of the System when requested by you. This disclosure at your request may require written authorization by you.

We do not store credit card or customer details with any 3rd parties except trusted suppliers who help us deliver the services associated with the System and we are committed to ensuring that all suppliers meet our security and data protection standards. As such, we may use and disclose your identifiable health information to obtain payment for services that we provide to you. For example, we may make disclosures to claim and obtain payment from your health insurer, HMO, or other company that arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your use of the System (“Your Payor”) or to verify that Your Payor will pay for health care.
Services and Operations
We may use and disclose your identifiable health information in connection with providing services, for our internal operations, which include administration, eligibility, planning, analytics and various activities that assess and improve the quality and cost effectiveness of the service that we deliver to you. Examples are using information about you to improve quality of the service, satisfaction surveys, de-identifying health information, customer services and internal training.

Possible information to be shared may include participation data (i.e. the fact that you used Mindset), milestone data (e.g. number of sessions you complete or how many times you practice the techniques) to allow you to earn incentives and rewards (if those are offered as part of your wellness program), as well as data from your initial self-report of worry and anxiety. Information that identifies you as an individual will not be shared with your employer.

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us, or click on a link in an email, if your computer supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. When you receive an email from us, you can opt out of receiving further emails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. However, by opting out of further email communications after you sign up, you may limit program reminders and other valuable program content and components.
Reminders and notifications
We may use and disclose your identifiable health information to contact you as a reminder to interact with, or complete tasks relating to your use of the System. You may make changes to the format and frequency of these reminders, or cancel these reminders and/or notifications by logging into your Mindset account in the App, and/or by accessing the native notification settings on your mobile device when using the App.
Third party service providers
There are some services provided in our organization through third party services providers. Examples of third party services providers include accounting services, server hosting and email delivery providers, business associates, vendors and other business partners and reputable companies in the industry who subcontract to us or to those of your employer as our corporate customers, where permitted by law. We may disclose your identifiable health information to our third party services providers so that they can perform the job that is required of them. To protect your identifiable health information, we require appropriate contracts or written agreements be in place that safeguard your identifiable health information.
Third party medical professionals
With your explicit permission, we may share your identifiable health information with third party medical professionals nominated by you.
Threat to health or safety
We may use and disclose your identifiable health information when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would only be to someone able to help prevent the threat.
As required by law
Certain laws permit or require certain uses and disclosures of identifiable health information for example, for public health activities, health oversight activities and law enforcement. In these instances, Mindset Health will only use or disclose your identifiable health information to the extent the law requires.
Personal representatives or persons involved with your care
We must use and disclose your identifiable health information to anyone who has the legal right to act for you (your personal representative) in order to administer your rights.

If you are unavailable or unable to object, we will use our best judgment to decide if the disclosure is in your best interests. Special rules apply regarding when we may disclose health information to family members and others involved in a deceased individual's care. We may disclose health information to any persons involved, prior to the death, in the care or payment for care of a deceased individual, unless we are aware that doing so would be inconsistent with a preference previously expressed by the deceased.
For research and publicity purposes
We may use identifiable health information for internal and external research and publicity purposes. This may include publishing aggregate information about our users (for example, that women ages 35-40 working in non-office jobs have the highest levels of worry) in the context of providing public health information and conducting academic research. In certain instances, we may only provide such information with special waivers and permissions from you.
Transfer of business assets
In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. If Mindset Health or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets. Mindset Health will ensure that information transferred to third parties will only be used in a way that is compliant with Privacy Shield Principles, and will remain liable in cases of onward transfers to third parties.
