How
do
we
collect
the
data:
When
you
interact
with
our
Site,
Application,
and/or
Services,
we
collect
information
that
could
be
used
to
identify
you
(“Personal
Data”).
Some
of
the
information
we
collect
is
stored
in
a
manner
that
cannot
be
linked
back
to
you
(“Non-Personal
Data”).
When
you
log
in,
we
collect
information
that
we
store
with
your
account
(typically
your
nickname,
email
address,
and
a
password
for
your
account),
which
we
treat
as
personal
information.
This
log
information
may
include
but
not
limited
to
your
Internet
Protocol
address,
browser
type,
browser
language,
the
date
and
time
of
your
query
and
cookie
data.
If
you
log
into
AnyStories
with
a
social
networking
credential,
such
as
with
a
third-party
account,
we
will
ask
permission
to
access
basic
information
from
that
account,
such
as
your
name
and
email
address.
You
can
stop
sharing
that
information
with
us
at
any
time
by
removing
AnyStories’s
access
to
that
account.
When
you
do
not
log
in
to
our
services,
we
store
the
information
we
collect
with
unique
identifiers
tied
to
the
application
and
device
you’re
using.
This
collection
helps
us
do
things
such
as
maintain
your
language
preferences
across
browsing
sessions.
We
collect
your
payment
information
if
you
are
a
paying
customer.
This
information
is
required
to
complete
a
commercial
transaction
on
our
Applications
and
our
Sites.
We
use
this
information
to
enable
and
fulfill
your
transaction.
If
you
choose
to
use
any
third-party’s
service
to
finalize
and
pay
for
your
order,
you
will
provide
your
credit
card
number
directly
to
the
third-party.
The
privacy
policy
of
the
third-party
will
apply
to
the
information
you
provide
on
its
website.
If
you
choose
to
participate
in
our
survey,
we
may
request
certain
Information
(including
Personal
Data
and
Non-Personal
Data)
from
you,
and
this
information
will
be
used
to
provide
personalized
help
and
instructions.
`
The
information
we
collect
and
how
that
information
is
used,
depends
on
how
you
use
our
services
and
how
you
manage
your
privacy
controls.
If
you
do
not
consent
to
it,
please
stop
using
the
Services.
This
is
important;
we
hope
you
will
take
time
to
read
it
thoroughly.
What

What
do
we
collect

Why
do
we
use
it?
If
you’re
just
browsing
our
Site,
we
don’t
collect
any
Personal
Information
about
you.
To
create
an
account
on
AnyStories
and
use
our
Services,
certain
Personal
Information
needs
to
be
collected
and
processed.
That
may
include
username,
date
of
birth,
email
address,
and
password,
depending
on
the
type
of
the
Services
you
are
using,
We
take
the
personal
information
above
as
private
by
default.
It
won’t
be
displayed
on
the
Site
(unless
you
make
corresponding
information
public
via
your
account
settings),
or
revealed
to
other
AnyStories
users,
or
rented
or
sold
to
anyone
unless
the
data
has
been
anonymized.
Your
email
address
is
required
when
creating
your
AnyStories
account,
while
you
have
the
option
not
to
disclose
any
Personal
Information
to
us.
In
that
case,
certain
Services
may
be
unavailable.
Why
do
we
collect
and
use
your
email?
We
use
email
as
an
important
way
to
communicate
with
you.
You
can
manage
your
email
notification
preferences,
such
as
messages
and
follower
alerts,
by
adjusting
your
preferences
in
the
Notifications
section
of
your
account
Settings.
You
may
also
opt
out
or
unsubscribe
from
any
future
email
communications
from
within
a
link
provided
in
each
email
we
send
you.
However,
please
note
that
in
all
cases
you
will
continue
to
receive
all
system
e-mails
(
e.g.
those
regarding
forgotten
user
passwords)
and
legal
notices
(e.g.
updates
to
our
policies)
from
us.
What
can
other
AnyStories

How
do
we
share
your
Personal

We
may
share
your

only
where
it’s
necessary
to
provide
any
of
the
Services
to
you
(e.g.,
email

server
providers,
etc.).
When
we
share
data
with
third-party
services
that

your
Personal

governmental
request;

To
enforce
or
apply
our
Terms
of
Use
and
other
policies,
including

of
potential
violations;

To
protect
the
rights,
property,
or
safety
of
AnyStories,
our
employees,
our
users,
or
the
public;

If
AnyStories
is
involved
in
a
merger,
acquisition
or
asset
sale,
in
which
case
we
will
continue
to
ensure
the
confidentiality
of
any
Personal
Information
and
give
affected
users
notice
before
Personal
Information
is
transferred
or
becomes
subject
to
a
different
privacy
policy.
We
never
post
anything
to
your
Facebook
or
other

accounts
without
your
permission.

Financial
Incentives
and
Non-Discrimination
1.
The
CCPA
allows
businesses
to
offer
consumers
financial
incentives
for
sharing
personal
information.
For
example,
a
business
can
offer
a
reward
programmer
or
provide
a
premium
service
to
consumers
as
compensation
for
their
personal
information.
Where
AnyStories
offers
these
programmers,
your
participation
is
optional.
If
you
choose
to
participate,
your
participation
will
be
subject
to
any
applicable
terms,
and
you
may
withdraw
at
any
time.
2.
The
CCPA
prohibits
businesses
from
discriminating
against
you
for
exercising
your
rights
under
the
law.
Such
discrimination
may
include
denying
a
good
or
service,
providing
a
different
level
or
quality
of
service,
or
charging
different
prices.
The
CCPA
permits
businesses
to
provide
differing
levels
or
quality
or
different
prices
where
the
business
can
demonstrate
that
the
difference
is
reasonably
related
to
the
value
to
the
business
of
the
consumer’s
personal
information.
3.
AnyStories
will
not
discriminate
against
you
for
exercising
your
rights

California
Consumer
Privacy
Act.
