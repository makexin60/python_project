Revolutionize Your Operations with Up-to-Date Building Data:
Reduce Costs, Downtime, Improve Service
OrthoGraph’s graphical asset management sets the de facto standard in Operational BIM.
Gain a clear and accurate view of all your assets throughout the entire building lifecycle, resulting in significant savings in construction, maintenance, contracting, and tendering processes. Achieve rapid ROI — often within weeks or months — by central asset knowledge, or by minimizing downtime, especially in industrial operations.

What is Operational BIM?
Is your rental space measured accurately?
Do you have a breakdown of room sizes and cleaning standards per room category?
Do you have a handle on your energy consumption? Where are your biggest energy drains located?
Do you know how much wall space needs a fresh coat of paint?
Are you confident in what’s really built into your building during construction?
Is your facility knowledge organized and easily accessible, or is it scattered and hard to find?
Are you on top of your maintenance needs? Do you know where all your maintenance points are located?
How is OrthoGraph Operational BIM different from CAFM?

This is comparable to the total construction cost of the building. All this while improving operational quality.

OrthoGraph resolves the problem, that building models are expensive to create, hard to keep up-to-date, and it is hard to integrate them into workflows and other systems. Usually they require expensive devices, software, and highly educated experts to create and handle, and quickly become obsolete. The importance of asset data and the identification of them and their exact position in the model is also often overlooked.
OrthoGraph is fast and accurate in model creation with its unique survey to BIM direct technology with embedded graphical asset inventory and offers 3 ways to access the data anywhere: application, web browser, and API-based enterprise-level integration with any third-party system (IWMS, CMMS, BMS etc.). The final model can be kept up-to-date by the regular maintenance crew on-site, at the point of changes. The 3 pillars of OrthoGraph thus are:
Simplicity
Accessibility
Maintainability

Operational BIM vs regular BIM –
it’s about money and workflows
There is a significant difference between the information you need for the long term building operation, facility management, and what you need for designing and construction. The proper use of BIM in the long-term lifecycle of a property when using it, renting it, manufacturing in it etc. will not just result in tons of cost saving, but highly increases the productive performance of it.
The difference between these two BIMs is less technical, it is a lot more about what’s stored in them and how you and your employees can access and maintain them. The Operational BIM should not be an over dimensioned data jungle but rather a sufficiently detailed, straight to the point, always up-to-date building documentation. It is supposed to be available both in the office and on site. By adding unique identifiers (bar codes, RFID) to the inventory the efficiency of operation and maintenance processes can be significantly increased.
