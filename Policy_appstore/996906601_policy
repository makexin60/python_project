PLOCKiT lives!
20/04/2016
Yup, the best kept secret among fun little puzzle games has been reborn.
PLOCKiT
now has a updated look and a fresh soundtrack, courtesy of the beat maestro Gramatik. There are bug fixes galore, new levels with new obstacles, hidden surprises, daily gifts, and of course in-app purchases, while the game remains to be available for free. Obviously the purchases are optional, but those power-ups can come mighty handy when you get stuck.
