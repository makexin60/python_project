Children's Privacy Policy
We have summarized the key points of the BAND Privacy Policy so that both adults and children can easily understand.
Before we guide you through the BAND Privacy Policy, let's find out what personal information is.
Personal information refers to all information that can be used to identify who you are. It includes your name, age, phone number, address, as well as nicknames or profile pictures.
Sometimes, you may need to disclose your personal information to someone else. For example, when ordering a product online, you need to provide your address to the seller for delivery. In these cases, it's important to carefully review how your personal information is used and managed.
BAND collects the minimum personal information necessary to provide our services.
When you sign up for BAND, we collect information such as your name and date of birth, as well as your mobile phone number, email address and password depending on the registration method. You need to provide this information to use BAND's services. Some information, like profile pictures and gender, is optional and is only shared with BAND if you choose to provide it. If you are under 14 years old, we also collect the information of your guardian, such as their name and date of birth, to obtain their consent.
We may additionally collect your personal information when you use BAND's various services, such as the BAND biz center or partner center, participate in events, or submit inquiries. In these cases, we will tell you in advance about the specific information we are collecting and obtain your consent.
There is also information that is automatically collected without you having to provide it. It includes information about the device you use to access BAND, such as your mobile phone or computer, location information and records of your BAND activities.
To make it convenient for you to use the BAND website and receive personalized information, we sometimes store small files containing information like your login status and browsing history on your computer or other devices. You can refuse to store or delete such files at any time if you wish, but please note that this may cause difficulties in using certain services like login.
The personal information collected is only used for the purposes that you’ve agreed to, or as required by law.
The personal information you provide to BAND is used for purposes such as member management, improving BAND services, sending service notifications, and creating a safe internet environment. It can also be used for developing new services by BAND and NAVER, providing customized services, and conducting various marketing and advertising activities.
Some of the tasks necessary for providing seamless services are performed by other companies on behalf of BAND. In these cases, we ensure that these companies handle your personal information securely.
We leave tasks such as responding to your inquiries, sending verification codes to your mobile phones, and delivering items such as event prizes to other companies that can perform those tasks more efficiently.
Some of these tasks are performed in other countries. For instance, to protect your information from natural disasters such as typhoons or floods, we store your information in both South Korea and other countries. We entrust tasks necessary for using BAND services overseas to companies located in those countries.
In some features of BAND, your personal information may be disclosed to other members or provided to other companies. However, we only do so with your consent or when permitted by law.
To facilitate communication among Band members, other members can see your name used in the Band and profile picture. If you wish, you can also choose to allow other members to see your date of birth and mobile phone number.
Your personal information may be provided to outside parties while using some features, such as sending gifts, creating BAND books, or exchanging money between members through NAVER Pay. In these cases, we inform you in advance about it and the reasons for sharing your information, and obtain your consent.
However, there are exceptions where personal information is temporarily provided to other companies before obtaining consent. This occurs when sending money to a Band member via NAVER Pay. In order to safely exchange money between Band members, both the person giving the money and the person receiving it must be identified. Therefore, when you send money to another member, your personal information, along with the recipient's personal information, is shared with NAVER Financial that operates NAVER Pay.
In this case, if the recipient has not consented to the sharing of personal information with NAVER Financial, their personal information is unavoidably shared before obtaining consent. The recipient agrees to the sharing of their personal information when receiving money. The personal information provided to NAVER Financial will be stored for 5 years in accordance with Article 22 of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act, as it is applicable as electronic financial transaction records.
When BAND can no longer use your personal information, we promptly and securely delete it.
We delete your personal information when you withdraw from BAND membership, when the retention period expires, or when the purpose for which your personal information was collected has been fulfilled. However, if the law specifies a retention period, the information is stored for that period and then deleted.
For paper documents containing personal information, we shred them into tiny pieces to make the information unidentifiable or burn them. For electronically stored personal information in file format, we use methods to erase it irrecoverable from computers and other devices.
You can review your personal information, correct any inaccuracies, or request to delete the information you no longer wish to be used.
You can view, modify, or delete your personal information at any time from "
My Info
" section. You can also
download
and review the content and membership information you've provided through the BAND Help Center.
Also, if you wish for selectively collected information, such as profile pictures and gender, to no longer be used by BAND, you can request to delete it at any time through the
Service Consent settings
. If you wish for all the personal information you provided to BAND to no longer be used, you can request
account deletion
.
If you are under 14 years old, your parents or guardians can make these requests on your behalf.
We are doing our best to safely manage and protect your personal information.
To prevent outsiders from learning your personal information, we use complex rules to obscure your original information, making it unidentifiable. We also have thorough measures to prevent unrestricted access to your personal information and to ensure that it doesn't leak to the outside world.
Moreover, we provide a feature for
account security checks
, which allows you to set up additional security measures to ensures that no one can log in without your permission. For example, if there are suspicious login attempts to your BAND account from a device that you haven't used with BAND before or from other countries, we may ask for additional information to double-check that the person attempting to log in is you.
If there are any changes to BAND's privacy policy, we will notify you in advance.
If there are additions, modifications, or deletions to the contents of the privacy policy, BAND will notify you through
announcements
or other means at least 7 days before making the changes. If there are significant changes to how BAND uses your personal information, we will notify you at least 30 days in advance.
Do you have any questions?
If you have any questions regarding personal information while using BAND, please contact our
Help Center
