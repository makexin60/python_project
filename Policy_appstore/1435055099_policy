Automated decision making and profiling
Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses
Personal Data
and/or
Special Categories of Personal Data
to make a decision without human intervention.
We use automated decision making, including profiling, in the following situations:
We use the information provided by you and obtained from third party sources about you, including your claims history and other factors relating to the risk proposed such as your address, your age and the type of vehicle you drive in order to undertake a risk assessment and to determine the appropriate premium.
During the underwriting process we may send some of your personal data to third party contractors in order to validate and obtain additional information relevant to the risk being proposed. We may also send your address details to a third party contractor to determine information about the area in which you live in order to assess any environmental risks (such as the potential flood risk).This is done in order to properly assess your risk profile which determines your premium and the insurance cover to be provided to you.
Underwriting is the process by which an insurance company assesses, accepts or rejects risks and classifies those selected, in order to charge an appropriate premium. The underwriting factors that must be evaluated to complete the underwriting process depend on the insurance product the customer is interested in; each product requires different categories of information to assess the risk profile of the proposer. We use an algorithm or internal model, which uses complex mathematical and actuarial methods of calculating and pooling risk, for insurance underwriting purposes. The algorithm and internal models are Zurich confidential intellectual property. As a result we cannot provide any further details of how they work in this Privacy Statement.
Where we base a decision on solely automated decision making, you will always be entitled to have a person review the decision so that you can contest it and to elaborate on your specific circumstances and make a personal representation.

Personal Data
and
Special Categories of Personal Data

Zurich Insurance Europe AG, Ireland Branch  - Data Retention Policy
Last updated: January 2024
There are a number of factors influencing how long we will hold personal data, including but not limited to the following:
The regulatory rules set out in applicable laws and regulations or set out in codes issued by regulatory authorities.
The type of product that we have provided to you.
The type of data that we hold about you.
Whether the data relates to any ongoing, pending, threatened, imminent or likely litigation or investigation.
As a general rule, we hold your information for the periods set out below:
Category
Retention
Quotation information:
15 months for personal insurances and 3 years for commercial insurances
Policy and Claims information
20/40/60 years after your policy has ceased or 20/40/60 years from the date of settlement of a claim under that policy, whichever is the later date *
Employment applications
2 years
*For non-motor policies that provide liability insurance cover (for example, household policies) we retain data for 40 or 60 years to enable us to deal with latent claims (situations where a claimant does not become aware of the damage or injury until a long time after it was caused). For all other policies we retain data for 20 years to enable us to deal with claims reported within the statute of limitations.
After the above periods have been reached, we will anonymise your personal data. "Anonymisation" of data means processing it with the aim of irreversibly preventing the identification of the individual to whom it relates. Data can be considered anonymised when it does not allow identification of the individuals to whom it relates, and it is not possible that any individual could be identified from the data by any further processing of that data or by processing it together with other information which is available or likely to be available.
