Cookie Policy
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your device to save certain information. The next time you visit our website on the same device, the information saved in the cookies will subsequently be transmitted either to our website (“First Party Cookie”) or to another website to which the cookie belongs (“Third Party Cookie”).
Through this information a website recognizes that you have already accessed and visited it with the browser you previously used. We use this information to be able to design and display the website in an optimum way in line with your preferences.
Consent to the use of Cookies
Cookies that are not strictly necessary to make the services available on our website are only used when you provide us with your consent. As soon as you actively accept the use of cookies via the cookie banner on our website, you consent to the use of cookies.
Deactivation or deletion of cookies
You can set your web browser in such a way that cookies are prevented from being saved to your device and/or that you are asked each time whether you are in agreement with cookies being enabled. You can also at any time delete cookies that have been enabled again. You can find out how all this works in detail via your browser’s help function.
Please note that in general deactivating cookies will lead to functional restrictions on the website.
We use the following cookies:
Essential cookies
These are required for the operation of the website.
Performance cookies

Functionality cookies
These are used to recognise you and remember your preferences or settings when you return to the site, so that we can provide you with the personalised experience you previously chose.
Privacy in our applications/Games
Applications and games / products
We have 2 distinct categories of products.
One time purchase products.
Products that you purchase for a one time fee do not contain adverts or analytics. Some of the products provide access to social media services such as high score tables. Any information you enter (e.g. by logging in) is used solely for the purpose of enabling you to participate in social activities such as posting a high score or comparing your score with others.  We only use the platform specific software APIs to obtain sufficient anonymous run time information to provide the social functions. This information is not stored by us + we do not maintain the high score lists, the platform providers perform this task.
Ad-funded products
We provide free to download and use, but ad-funded products. This enables us to provide you with free to use products yet still generate some revenue to develop and support the products. You can choose to remove the adverts by using an In App Purchase.
Windows Store Ad funded products
Some of our Windows Store games include an Ad SDK produced by Pubfinity. The full privacy policy for any produts that include the
Pubfinity SDK can be found here.
iOS and Android Ad funded products
The advertising, analytics and social media services use device identifiers, local storage and cookies/mobile Ids. Information will be collected and shared with back end services to provide appropriate advertizing content and information. For example, country or language information will be collected at run time to provide adverts relevant to the country or language currently in use. The advert providers (e.g. Google and their ad technology partners) will use these identifiers and cookies (or their mobile equivalents) to track which adverts you have been delivered, prevent fraud and which adverts you have shown interest in. By doing so they are able to generate revenue from advertizers which in turn they share with us, thereby enabling you to benefit from free to use products.
Each platform provides a mechanism to disable targetted adverts:
On iOS choose the “Settings | Privacy | Limit ad tracking” option.
On Android choose the “Settings | Google | Ads | Opt out of Ads Personalization” option.
On Huawei devices without Google Play services choose the “
Settings | Privacy | Ads and Privacy Settings | Security & privacy | More settings | Device identifier” option.
On Windows 10, choose the “Settings | Privacy” option.
Some of our games are available via the Huawei App Store and contain SDKs provided by Huawei. An in depth description of how Huawei and their ad SDK technology partners use the information that gets collected by their SDK is available at:
How Huawei uses info collected by their ads SDK.
By downloading and continuing to use our ad-funded products you consent to these technology providers to collecting and sharing information.
Some of our games are available via the Google Play Store and incorporate SDKs from Google. Google provide an depth description of how they and their ad technology partners use the information that gets collected by their SDKs and platforms that we use in our apps and games:
How Google Uses Info Collected by their ads SDK
Google ad technology providers information
We use the standard set of ‘Commonly Used Ad Technology Providers’ as defined by Google. The current list is at the bottom of this page. By downloading and continuing to use our ad-funded products you consent to these technology providers to collecting and sharing information.
Some of our ad-funded products use an ad-mediation SDK from Ogury. A detailed description of how and what information they and their mediation partners collect can be found on the
Ogury Privacy page
.
Some of our ad-funded games contain Firebase Analytics. The Analytics service collect anonymous device information and identifiers as described by Googles policies:
Google FireBase Analytics information
We use the analytics information to understand roughly how many, how and where in the world people are playing our games so we can improve the products. Google Firebase is certified under relevant privacy and security standards.
You should note that opting out of targetted or personalized adverts does not mean you would not receive any adverts or that no information is collected (e.g. some country or language information so we can display the correct language text!). It simply means the adverts are less likely to be relevant to you. Simplistically, if you do not wish any information to be collected or shared then do not download and use the free to play ad-funded products.  If you have downloaded and used the products and no longer wish any information be collected or shared simply uninstall the products or use the In App Purchase to remove the adverts. The product description pages in the various app stores mark which products contain adverts.
Some of the products provide access to social media services such as high score tables. Any information you enter (e.g. by logging in) is used solely for the purpose of enabling you to participate in social activities such as posting a high score or comparing your score with others.  We only use the platform specific software APIs to obtain sufficient anonymous run time information to provide the social functions. This information is not stored by us + we do not maintain the high score lists, the platform providers perform this task.
