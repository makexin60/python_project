We will never collect any unnecessary personal data from you and do not process your information in any way, other than as specified in this notice.
Cookies (and other browser or device based storage)
We set and use (first party) cookies on Netweather for a number of purposes - these ensure a good experience and have functions which include keeping you logged in to any parts of the site you may be registered for (such as the forum or Netweather Extra), storing settings and forecast locations for your use as you move around the site or for return visits, and for us to analyse anonymised usage statistics and data for the usage of our website and apps.
Our first party cookies contain no personal information, and are set solely to be used on Netweather.

Similar to the vast majority of websites, our servers also make logs of the usage of our website and services (such as our apps and data feed API’s). These log files include information such as IP address, browser and device type, pages visited and the urls of referring pages.
We store these logs securely and use them to track any errors, for security auditing, and to identify or investigate any potentially malicious use of our services. We regularly ‘rotate’ these logs and they are usually not kept for longer than 30 days. We won’t share log files with any third parties, unless required to by law, or if they’re required to establish or exercise our legal rights (eg to defend against legal claims). We may also anonymise them (by removing any IP addresses) and share them with our service providers should they be required for troubleshooting or investigation.
