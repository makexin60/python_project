Are you a medical student or international doctor planning to work in the UK?
Join thousands of others using Plabable to ace the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) part 1 and Medical Licensing Assessment (MLA) Applied Knowledge Test (AKT). We offer thousands of high-yield questions written and reviewed by ourselves, our NHS colleagues and those who have passed the exams. Our resources are specifically designed to cater to the needs of two major exams: The PLAB exam (for international medical graduates) and the UK MLA AKT (for UK medical students). They both are set at similar levels and share the same MLA content map. Find out more here:
