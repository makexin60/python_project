[Privacy Policy Updates] Latest Update Time: 2022-12-05 (UTC+8)
This Privacy Policy explains how BingX and its Affiliates (“BingX”) collect, use, share, and protect user information obtained through the BingX website (https://www.bingX.com), or our mobile applications, or any other related services provided by BingX. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to BingX and its affiliates. When we ask for certain personal information from users it is because we are required by law to collect this information or it is relevant for specified purposes. Any non-required information you provide to us is done so voluntarily. You decided whether to provide us with these non-required information; you may not be able to access or utilize all of our Services if you choose not to.
By using this site and related Application Programming Interfaces (API) or mobile applications, you agree to the policies and practices of our Privacy Policy, so please read this document carefully.
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use and store such data, and how we share such data. If you do not wish to have your Personal Data (as defined below) used in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, you may not use the site or any of the services, software, APIs, technologies, products and/or features offered by the site (the "Services").
Definitions
Virtual Financial Asset
As used herein, "Virtual Financial Asset" also called "convertible virtual currency", "cryptocurrency" or "digital goods", such as bitcoin or ether, which is based on the cryptographic protocol of a computer network that may be (i) centralized or decentralized, (ii) closed or open-source, and (iii) used as a medium of exchange and/or store of value.
Personal Data
As used herein, “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, economic, cultural or social identity of you as a natural person.
WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
BingX collects, processes, and stores Personal Data collected from you via your use of the Service or where you have given your consent. This Personal Data may include contact details, copies of identification documentation provided by you or derived from publicly accessible databases, your government identification number as well as information relating to your device or internet service (such as an IP address and a MAC number).
Operating within certain regulated jurisdictions around the world, BingX collects, stores and processes your personal data in accordance with the various regulations to which we are subject, and we aim for the highest standards of compliance and adherence to all such data privacy requirements.   The following provisions in this Privacy Policy are an amalgamation of these regulations to which our group as a whole is subject, and serves as a single policy point to govern our data collection, storage and processing activities. As these regulations are amended from time to time, we are also required to ensure that our data practices are up to date by amending the provisions herein.
We collect the information you provide during the BingX onboarding process, which may be a completed, incomplete, or abandoned process. We also collect personal data when you communicate with us through customer support, subscribe to marketing messages or contact us by phone, email or other communication channels.

COLLECTION AND TRANSFER OF DATA OUTSIDE OF YOUR JURISDICTION
As we may collect Personal Data from customers located from different jurisdictions, and most of these jurisdictions will require consent for the transfer of such Personal Data from your jurisdiction to outside of the area, your explicit consent is required and hereby assumed by way of your use and/or continued use of the Services.  If you decline to consent to such transfer, you will no longer be able to use BingX’s platform and/or our Services.  You will have the ability to withdraw your digital assets; however, all other functionalities will be disabled.
HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
BingX uses Personal Data to communicate with you and to administer, deliver, improve, and personalize the Service. BingX might also generate generic data out of any Personal Data we collect and use it for our own purposes. We may also use such data to communicate with you in relation to other products or services offered by BingX and/or its partners. We do not share your Personal Data with third parties (other than partners in connection with their services to BingX) except where you have given your consent and further detailed below.
We may share your Personal Data with third parties:
(a) if we think that sharing it is necessary to enforce the Terms of Service;
(b) to comply with government agencies, including regulators, law enforcement and/or justice departments;
(c) to third parties who provide services to BingX (such as administration or technical services);
(d) in connection with the sale or transfer of our business or any part thereof.
Additionally, we have implemented international standards to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and circumventing trade and economic sanctions and will implement final Virtual Financial Asset rules and regulations when effective, which will likely require us to undertake due diligence on our customers. 
 This may include the use of third-party data and service providers which we will cross-reference with your personal information.
To realize the [Share] function, we use MobTech's [ShareSDK] product. The privacy policy terms of this product can be found at: http://www.mob.com/about/policy
HOW WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We aim to protect users and BingX from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of the personal data that we collect and store. We take various measures to ensure information security. We store your data securely in fault-tolerant secure storage which is encrypted with industry standards, and take multiple security measures to ensure that user data will not be lost, abused, or altered, including but not limited to:
5.1 Physical Measures. Materials containing your personal information will be stored in a locked place. Your personal information will only be stored in the physical form under special circumstances.
5.2 Electronic Measures. Computer data containing your personal information will be stored in the computer systems and storage media that are subject to strict login restrictions.
5.3 Management Measures. Only authorized employees are permitted to come into contact with your personal information and such employees must comply with our internal confidentiality rules for personal data. We have also imposed strict physical access controls to buildings and files. In addition, we continuously train staff on relevant laws and regulations and privacy security guidelines, and security awareness, and regularly organize emergency response training and emergency drills for relevant internal personnel to master their job responsibilities and emergency response strategies and protocols.
5.5 Other Measures. Our web server is protected by various "firewalls".
Please note that it is impossible to guarantee 100% security of information. As such, we request that you understand the responsibility to independently take safety precautions to protect your own personal information.
Here are some safety steps that you need to know about.
5.6 Use a strong user identification, password, and PIN to access accounts that others do not know or cannot easily guess ("User Credentials"). The user credentials must meet the requirements we specified when you create them. You should keep your user credentials safe and private and do not share your user credentials with anyone.
5.7 Anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software are recommended to be installed on personal computers and mobile devices.
5.8 The operating system, anti-virus and firewall products should be updated regularly and updated to the latest security patches or versions.

5.10 Back up your critical data regularly.
5.11 Consider using encryption technology to protect highly sensitive or confidential information.

Unless otherwise stipulated by law or the Terms of Use, you agree that we have the right but not the obligation to retain all the collected personal information for the duration of your Account for 5 more years after the account is closed.  You agree that we shall not be liable for any information leakage and other losses not caused by our intention or gross negligence, including but not limited to hacker attack, power interruption, or unavoidable technical failure, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
ACCESS, CORRECTION, AND DELETION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
You have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data upon request and ascertain whether the information we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date. If any of your Personal Data is inaccurate, you may request to update your information. You may also request to delete your Personal Data, with exception that we may refuse your deletion request in certain circumstances, such as compliance with law or legal purposes.  For data access, correction, or deletion requests, please contact support@bingx.com with the subject “DATA INQUIRY”.
In response to data access, correction, or deletion request, please note that, for your own protection as well as ours, we shall only be able to do so with the proper and verified authorization of the data owner himself or herself. Therefore, before taking any action, we will take all steps as considered necessary in our absolute discretion to carry out said verification of the requester’s identity (including but not limited to a telephone call-back or email response from the data owner’s email address on file, or such procedures as we may in our discretion require) so as to ensure the legitimacy of the request.  Due to possible complexities and cross-border time differences, we are unable to commit to a timeline within which such requests can be fulfilled, and BingX hereby disclaims any liability for any loss or damage howsoever suffered as a result of a data access, correction or deletion request not being attended to by us on a timely basis. Also, while we aim to respond to data requests without charge, we hereby reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee should the request prove to be onerous, repetitive, or require additional resources to be complied with.
