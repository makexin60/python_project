Information about the collection of personal data
Personal data is all data that can be related to you personally, e.g., name, address, e-mail addresses, user behaviour.
If we use contracted service providers for individual functions of Getir Portugal’s offer or would like to use your data for advertising purposes, we will inform you in detail about the respective processes below. In doing so, we will also state the defined criteria for the storage period.
What personal data does Getir collect and why?
The personal data that we collect about you falls into the following categories:
a) Data that are collected while downloading the App
When you download the App, the required data is transferred to the App Store or Google Play Store, i.e. in particular user name, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information and the individual device identification number. We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it. We only process the data insofar as it is necessary for downloading the App to your mobile device.
b) Data that you provide voluntarily
Registration
When you download and use the App, we will collect personal data to register you and create an account. This includes:
Identity and contact details: your name, surname, delivery address, phone number and email address. We will also ask you to create a password for your account and we will store this password information with encryption.
The processing of your personal data is based on your consent as well as our obligations to fulfil the contract concluded with you.
Using the app
Within the scope of the App, you can enter, manage and edit your profile information. This information includes, in particular, your name, surname, email address, delivery address, payment information, billing information and password.
The app also requires the following authorisations:
Internet access: This is required in order for you to access and use the App.
User authentication: This is required to verify your identity as the account holder.
Usage data is processed and used to provide the service. This data processing is justified by the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract between you as the data subject and us in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR for the use of the App.

Financial details: your payment information and payment methods;
Customer transaction details: your shopping history, order information, and invoice information as well as any enquiries, or complaints submitted to us, including call recordings if you call us and live support records from our customer services team;
Rating, Comment and Review Details: the ranking or rate you have scored your experience of using the App and Getir services, as well as any comments and reviews you have submitted to us and customer satisfaction survey responses.
The processing of your personal data is performed for the fulfilment of the contract concluded with you.
Contact by e-mail or via contact form
When you contact us by e-mail or via a contact form, your e-mail address and, if provided by you, your name and telephone number will be stored by us in order to answer your questions. We delete the data collected in this context after the storage is no longer necessary, or - in the case of legal retention obligations - restrict the processing.
In some instances, such as allergic reactions to products delivered by Getir, some of the personal data that you provide may include sensitive personal data (e.g., such as allergy information or other health-related information). Such sensitive personal data will only be processed based on your freely given consent.
Marketing Communications
You may subscribe to a free newsletter. When registering for newsletter, the data from the input mask will be transmitted to us
This data includes your e-mail address and, if provided by you, your name and telephone number.
If you (i) create an account with us or purchase goods or services via the App and (ii) provide your e-mail address, it may subsequently be used by us to send you marketing messages. In such cases, personalised advertising for our own similar goods and services may be sent via (i) our newsletters or (ii) social media platforms.
If you register for the newsletter, the data processing will be based on your consent. If we send you newsletters as a result of the sale of goods and services, the processing is based on article 13-A of Law 46/2012 of August 29.
You have the right to
opt-out of marketing communications
we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by (i) clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you, or (ii) unticking the communication channels you wish to opt-out under the Profile - Communication Preferences section in the App.
In-App Recommendations
We may use your profile information, order and search history to recommend relevant products and services in the App.

Personalised Offers & Ads
We may use your device data and app interactions to: a) display product recommendations or ads on the App or via third-party service providers (including social media platforms); and b) measure the effectiveness of such ads.

Specifically, this includes:

Mobile App Cookie Policy
and the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology” below.
The processing of your personal data is based on your consent as well as our obligations to fulfil the contract concluded with you.
We may also process personal data relating to your order history, product purchases and app usage for segmentation purposes. We do this using cookies and SDKs via client IDs for digital marketing activities (such as product-based push notifications).

Legal basis for processing personal data
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will collect and process your personal data
pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR where we have your
consent
to do so for a specific purpose that we communicate to you and when required by applicable data protection laws, such as processing of purchase history for the purposes of delivering specific services, contents or advertising, depending on your purchase history;
pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR where we need the personal data to
perform a contract with you
, such as information strictly necessary for the purposes of entering into or performing a contract with you and providing deliveries;

If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests, this interest will be to operate the App and communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, or improving the App. In addition to the legitimate interests described in this Privacy Policy, we may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
How does Getir keep my personal data secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data. Specific measures we or our third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
International data transfers
The service providers and business partners are carefully selected by us with particular regard to the suitability of the technical and organizational measures taken by them and checked for their compliance. We process the data in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) as a matter of principle. However, it is possible that your data may be transferred to controllers or processors in a country outside the European Union or the EEA (so-called "third country"). These countries may not have the same level of data protection as the EEA. However, we are obliged to ensure that the personal data processed by us, our group companies and our partners outside the EEA are protected in the same way as if they were processed within the EEA. Therefore, if your data is processed outside the EEA, there are certain safeguards in place.
In this case, we will provide suitable guarantees to ensure that the respective service providers protect the data appropriately, such as entering into the EU model clauses with the recipient of such data. We ensure similar protection by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
Your personal data will be transferred to countries whose level of data protection is considered appropriate by the European Commission according to art. 45 GDPR;
We use the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU and carry out Transfer Impact Assessment for each personal data transfer outside the EEA and assess whether the laws and practices of the third country offer a level of protection substantially equivalent to that of the EEA;
An exception as set out in art. 49 GDPR;
Other safeguards as specified in art. 46 GDPR.
Your personal data may be processed in the United States of America (US), United Kingdom (UK), India and Turkey.
For personal data processing in the US, India and Turkey we enter into the data processing agreements and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses based on the European Commission Implementing Decision of June 4, 2021 (EU 2021/914). Furthermore, we carry out Transfer Impact Assessments to make sure that our group companies and business partners provide adequate protection of personal data.
For processing taking place in the United Kingdom, we rely on the European Commission adequacy decision to transfer personal data.
Data retention
Your personal data will be stored and retained for us in accordance with the applicable laws on data protection, and to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out under this Privacy Policy or resulting from such laws. We retain personal data we collect from you to provide you with our services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. For example:
for marketing communications, we will keep your personal data until the withdrawal of your consent; or
for your personal data necessary for the performance of a contract, we will keep such data for the duration of our contractual relationship.
When it is no longer necessary to process your personal data for the purposes for which it is processed, we will either aggregate, delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Privacy Policy, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
Automated decision processing
We use technologies involving algorithms and automated decision processing to provide our services, based on real-time decision process or on analytics or the categorization of various usage of our service. However, we will not make any automated decisions about an individual which would produce legal effects or similarly significantly effects on the data subject, unless where it is (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract, (ii) or pursuant to individual’s prior consent, or (iii) required by applicable law.
Your data privacy rights
You have the following data privacy rights:
Right to information
You have the right to receive information from us at any time, upon request, about the personal data we process that concerns you within the scope of Art. 15 GDPR. To do this, you can send a request by post or email to the addresses below.
Right to rectify inaccurate data
You have the right to request that we correct personal data relating to you without delay if it is incorrect. To do so, please contact us at the addresses below.
Right to erasure
You have the right, under the conditions described in Art. 17 GDPR, to demand that we delete the personal data relating to you. You may request deletion of your account and the associated personal data: (i) through the Account Settings page in our App (iOS users); or (ii)  by contacting us using the contact details provided below (all users). After deleting your account, we may retain certain personal data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations and as necessary to protect our legitimate business interests. For example, we may retain personal data for legal, tax or accounting purposes or for the prevention of fraud.
Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to demand that we restrict processing in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR. This right exists in particular if the accuracy of the personal data is disputed between the user and us, for the period of time required to verify the accuracy, as well as in the event that the user requests restricted processing instead of erasure in the case of an existing right to erasure; furthermore, in the event that the data is no longer necessary for the purposes pursued by us, but the user requires it for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims, as well as if the successful exercise of an objection is still disputed between us and the user. To exercise your right to restrict processing, please contact us at the addresses below.

You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out, inter alia, on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR. We will stop processing your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Right of complaint
You also have the right to contact the competent supervisory authority in case of complaints. The competent supervisory authority is
Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados
, who can be found under

How does Getir keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we or our third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
International data transfers
The service providers and business partners are carefully selected by us with particular regard to the suitability of the technical and organizational measures taken by them and checked for their compliance. We process the data in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) as a matter of principle. However, it is possible that your data may be transferred to controllers or processors in a country outside the European Union or the EEA (so-called "third country"). These countries may not have the same level of data protection as the EEA. However, we are obliged to ensure that the personal data processed by us, our group companies and our partners outside the EEA are protected in the same way as if they were processed within the EEA. Therefore, if your data is processed outside the EEA, there are certain safeguards in place.
In this case, we will provide suitable guarantees to ensure that the respective service providers protect the data appropriately, such as entering into the EU model clauses with the recipient of such data. We ensure similar protection by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
Your personal data will be transferred to countries whose level of data protection is considered appropriate by the European Commission according to art. 45 GDPR;
We use the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU and carry out Transfer Impact Assessment for each personal data transfer outside the EEA and assess whether the laws and practices of the third country offer a level of protection substantially equivalent to that of the EEA;
An exception as set out in art. 49 GDPR;
Other safeguards as specified in art. 46 GDPR.
Your personal data may be processed in the United States of America (US), United Kingdom (UK), India and Turkey.
For personal data processing in the US, India and Turkey we enter into the data processing agreements and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses based on the European Commission Implementing Decision of June 4, 2021 (EU 2021/914). Furthermore, we carry out Transfer Impact Assessments to make sure that our group companies and business partners provide adequate protection of personal data.
For processing taking place in the United Kingdom, we rely on the European Commission adequacy decision to transfer personal data.
Data retention
Your personal information will be stored and retained for us in accordance with the applicable laws on data protection, and to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out under this Privacy Policy or resulting from such laws. We retain personal information we collect from you to provide you with our services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. For example:
for marketing communications, we will keep your personal information until the withdrawal of your consent; or
for your personal information necessary for the performance of a contract, we will keep such information for the duration of our contractual relationship.
When it is no longer necessary to process your personal information for the purposes for which it is processed, we will either aggregate, delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Privacy Policy, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
Automated decision processing
We use technologies involving algorithms and automated decision processing to provide our services, based on real-time decision process or on analytics or the categorization of various usage of our service. However, we will not make any automated decisions about an individual which would produce legal affects or similarly significantly affects on the data subject, unless where it is (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract, (ii) or pursuant to individual’s prior consent, or (iii) required by applicable law.
Your data protection rights

How does Getir keep my personal information secure?

Specific measures we or our third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.

We process the data in the EEA as a matter of principle.

These countries may not have the same level of data protection as the EEA. However, we are obliged to ensure that the personal data processed by us, our group companies and our partners outside the EEA are protected in the same way as if they were processed within the EEA.

for marketing communications, we will keep your personal data for a maximum period of 3 years from your last interaction initiated by you with our services or until the withdrawal of your consent (if the consent is withdrawn before the expiry of this maximum retention period); or
for your personal data necessary for the performance of a contract, we will keep such information for the duration of our contractual relationship.
When it is no longer necessary to process your personal data for the purposes for which it is processed, we will either aggregate, delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Privacy Policy, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

Information about the collection of personal data
Personal data is all data that can be related to you personally, e.g., name, address, e-mail addresses, user behavior.
If we use contracted service providers for individual functions of our offer or would like to use your data for advertising purposes, we will inform you in detail about the respective processes below. In doing so, we will also state the defined criteria for the storage period.
What personal data does Getir collect and why?
The personal data that we collect about you falls into the following categories:
1.
Data that are collected while downloading the App
When you download our App, the required data is transferred to the App Store or Google Play Store, i.e. in particular user name, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information and the individual device identification number. We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it. We only process the data insofar as it is necessary for downloading our App to your mobile device.

When you download and use our App, we will collect personal data to register you and create an account. This includes:

Within the scope of the App, you can enter, manage and edit your profile information. This information includes, in particular, your name, surname, email address, delivery address, payment information, billing information and password.
The app also requires the following authorizations:
Internet access: This is required in order for you to access and use our App.
User authentication: This is required to verify your identity as the account holder.
Usage data is processed and used to provide the service. This data processing is justified by the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract between you as the data subject and us in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO for the use of the App.
Processing of Orders

In some instances, such as allergic reactions to products delivered by Getir, some of the personal information that you provide may include sensitive personal data (e.g., such as allergy information or other health-related information). Such sensitive personal data will only be processed based on your freely given consent.

If you register for the newsletter, the data processing will be based on your consent. If we send you newsletters as a result of the sale of goods and services, the processing is based on § 7 (3) UWG.

opt-out of marketing communications

If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests, this interest will be to operate our App and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, or improving our App. In addition to the legitimate interests described in this Privacy Policy, we may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
How does Getir keep my personal data secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data. Specific measures we or our third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
International data transfers
The service providers and business partners are carefully selected by us with particular regard to the suitability of the technical and organizational measures taken by them and checked for their compliance. We process the data in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) as a matter of principle. However, it is possible that your data may be transferred to controllers or processors in a country outside the European Union or the EEA (so-called "third country"). These countries may not have the same level of data protection as the EEA. However, we are obliged to ensure that the personal data processed by us, our group companies and our partners outside the EEA are protected in the same way as if they were processed within the EEA. Therefore, if your data is processed outside the EEA, there are certain safeguards in place.
In this case, we will provide suitable guarantees to ensure that the respective service providers protect the data appropriately, such as entering into the EU model clauses with the recipient of such data. We ensure similar protection by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
Your personal data will be transferred to countries whose level of data protection is considered appropriate by the European Commission according to art. 45 GDPR;
We use the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU and carry out Transfer Impact Assessment for each personal data transfer outside the EEA and assess whether the laws and practices of the third country offer a level of protection substantially equivalent to that of the EEA;
An exception as set out in art. 49 GDPR;
Other safeguards as specified in art. 46 GDPR.
Your personal data may be processed in the United States of America (US), United Kingdom (UK), India and Turkey.
For personal data processing in the US, India and Turkey we enter into the data processing agreements and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses based on the European Commission Implementing Decision of June 4, 2021 (EU 2021/914). Furthermore, we carry out Transfer Impact Assessments to make sure that our group companies and business partners provide adequate protection of personal data.
For processing taking place in the United Kingdom, we rely on the European Commission adequacy decision to transfer personal data.
Data retention
Your personal data will be stored and retained for us in accordance with the applicable laws on data protection, and to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out under this Privacy Policy or resulting from such laws. We retain personal data we collect from you to provide you with our services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. For example:
for marketing communications, we will keep your personal data until the withdrawal of your consent; or
for your personal data necessary for the performance of a contract, we will keep such data for the duration of our contractual relationship.
When it is no longer necessary to process your personal data for the purposes for which it is processed, we will either aggregate, delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Privacy Policy, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
Automated decision processing
We use technologies involving algorithms and automated decision processing to provide our services, based on real-time decision processes or on analytics or the categorization of various usage of our service. However, we will not make any automated decisions about an individual which would produce legal affects or similarly significantly affects on the data subject, unless where it is (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract, (ii) or pursuant to individual’s prior consent, or (iii) required by applicable law.

The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data. Specific measures we or our third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
International data transfers
"The service providers and business partners are carefully selected by us with particular regard to the suitability of the technical and organizational measures taken by them and checked for their compliance. We process the data in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) as a matter of principle. However, it is possible that your data may be transferred to controllers or processors in a country outside the European Union or the EEA (so-called ""third country""). These countries may not have the same level of data protection as the EEA. However, we are obliged to ensure that the personal data processed by us, our group companies and our partners outside the EEA are protected in the same way as if they were processed within the EEA. Therefore, if your data is processed outside the EEA, there are certain safeguards in place.
In this case, we will provide suitable guarantees to ensure that the respective service providers protect the data appropriately, such as entering into the EU model clauses with the recipient of such data. We ensure similar protection by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
Your personal data will be transferred to countries whose level of data protection is considered appropriate by the European Commission according to art. 45 GDPR;
We use the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU and carry out Transfer Impact Assessment for each personal data transfer outside the EEA and assess whether the laws and practices of the third country offer a level of protection substantially equivalent to that of the EEA;
An exception as set out in art. 49 GDPR;
Other safeguards as specified in art. 46 GDPR.
Your personal data may be processed in the United States of America (US), United Kingdom (UK), India and Turkey.
For personal data processing in the US, India and Turkey we enter into the data processing agreements and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses based on the European Commission Implementing Decision of June 4, 2021 (EU 2021/914). Furthermore, we carry out Transfer Impact Assessments to make sure that our group companies and business partners provide adequate protection of personal data.
For processing taking place in the United Kingdom, we rely on the European Commission adequacy decision to transfer personal data."
Data retention
Your personal data will be stored and retained for us in accordance with the applicable laws on data protection, and to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out under this Privacy Policy or resulting from such laws. We retain personal data we collect from you to provide you with our services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. For example:
for marketing communications, we will keep your personal data until the withdrawal of your consent; or
for your personal data necessary for the performance of a contract, we will keep such data for the duration of our contractual relationship.
When it is no longer necessary to process your personal data for the purposes for which it is processed, we will either aggregate, delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Privacy Policy, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
Automated decision processing
We use technologies involving algorithms and automated decision processing to provide our services, based on real-time decision process or on analytics or the categorization of various usage of our service. However, we will not make any automated decisions about an individual which would produce legal effects or similarly significantly effects on the data subject, unless where it is (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract, (ii) or pursuant to individual’s prior consent, or (iii) required by applicable law.

What is the legal basis for processing my personal information?

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests, this interest will normally be to: (i) operate our App, (ii) provide an experience that meets your expectations (for example, by showing you products or offers that are more relevant to you); and (iii) communicate with you as necessary to provide or improve our services.. In addition to these, we may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
How does Getir keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures that we or our third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
Specifically, our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the UK or EEA in accordance with UK and/or European Union data protection law, as applicable.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
Data retention
We may retain personal information we collect from you to comply with our legal obligations or where we have a legitimate business need. For example, to provide you with information you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Automated decision making
We may use your personal information to make automated decisions in order to provide our services. However, we will not make any automated decisions about an individual which would produce legal effects or similarly significant effects on the data subject, unless it is: (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract, (ii) pursuant to the individual’s prior consent, or (iii) required by  law.
Your data protection rights
If you wish to
access, correct, update
your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided below.
You may request deletion of your account and the associated personal information: (i)  through the Account Settings page in our App (iOS users); or (ii)  by contacting us using the contact details provided below (all users). After deleting your account, we may retain certain personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations and as necessary to protect our legitimate business interests. For example, we may retain personal information for legal, tax or accounting purposes or for the prevention of fraud.
You can
object to all or some of our processing
of your personal information, in particular, when the processing is based on our legitimate interests. We may continue to process your personal information after such an objection to the extent permitted by law.
You can ask us to
restrict processing
of your personal information or
request portability
of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided.
You have the right to
opt-out of marketing communications
we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by: (i) clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you; (ii) contacting us through the contact details provided; or (iii) by changing your permission settings in the Communication Preferences section under the Profile tab in our App.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can
withdraw your consent
at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the
right to complain to a data protection authority
about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) whose details are available
here.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Updates to this Privacy Notice
We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.

Information about the collection of personal data
Personal data is all data that can be related to you personally, e.g., name, address, e-mail addresses, user behaviour.
If we use contracted service providers for individual functions of Getir Spain’s offer or would like to use your data for advertising purposes, we will inform you in detail about the respective processes below. In doing so, we will also state the defined criteria for the storage period.
What personal data does Getir collect and why?
The personal data that we collect about you falls into the following categories:
a) Data that are collected while downloading the App
When you download the App, the required data is transferred to the App Store or Google Play Store, i.e. in particular user name, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information and the individual device identification number. We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it. We only process the data insofar as it is necessary for downloading the App to your mobile device.
b) Data that you provide voluntarily
Registration
When you download and use the App, we will collect personal data to register you and create an account. This includes:
Identity and contact details: your name, surname, delivery address, phone number and email address. We will also ask you to create a password for your account and we will store this password information with encryption.
The processing of your personal data is based on your consent as well as our obligations to fulfil the contract concluded with you.
Using the app
Within the scope of the App, you can enter, manage and edit your profile information. This information includes, in particular, your name, surname, email address, delivery address, payment information, billing information and password.
The app also requires the following authorisations:
Internet access: This is required in order for you to access and use the App.
User authentication: This is required to verify your identity as the account holder.
Usage data is processed and used to provide the service. This data processing is justified by the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract between you as the data subject and us in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR for the use of the App.
Processing of Orders
When you start to use the App we require certain information to process your order and deliver the products to you. Your personal data we process includes:

The processing of your personal data is performed for the fulfilment of the contract concluded with you.
Contact by e-mail or via contact form
When you contact us by e-mail or via a contact form, your e-mail address and, if provided by you, your name and telephone number will be stored by us in order to answer your questions. We delete the data collected in this context after the storage is no longer necessary, or - in the case of legal retention obligations - restrict the processing.
In some instances, such as allergic reactions to products delivered by Getir, some of the personal data that you provide may include sensitive personal data (e.g., such as allergy information or other health-related information). Such sensitive personal data will only be processed based on your freely given consent.
Marketing Communications
You may subscribe to a free newsletter. When registering for newsletter, the data from the input mask will be transmitted to us
This data includes your e-mail address and, if provided by you, your name and telephone number.
If you (i) create an account with us or purchase goods or services via the App and (ii) provide your e-mail address, it may subsequently be used by us to send you marketing messages. In such cases, personalised advertising for our own similar goods and services may be sent via (i) our newsletters or (ii) social media platforms.
If you register for the newsletter, the data processing will be based on your consent. If we send you newsletters as a result of the sale of goods and services, the processing is based on article 21.2 of the LSSI (Law 34/2002, of 11 July, of information society services and e-commerce).
You have the right to
opt-out of marketing communications
we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by (i) clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you, or (ii) unticking the communication channels you wish to opt-out under the Profile - Communication Preferences section in the App.
In-App Recommendations
We may use your profile information, order and search history to recommend relevant products and services in the App.

Personalised Offers & Ads
We may use your device data and app interactions to: a) display product recommendations or ads on the App or via third-party service providers (including social media platforms); and b) measure the effectiveness of such ads.

and the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology” below.
The processing of your personal data is based on your consent as well as our obligations to fulfil the contract concluded with you.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
How does Getir keep my personal data secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data. Specific measures we or our third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
International data transfers
The service providers and business partners are carefully selected by us with particular regard to the suitability of the technical and organizational measures taken by them and checked for their compliance. We process the data in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) as a matter of principle. However, it is possible that your data may be transferred to controllers or processors in a country outside the European Union or the EEA (so-called "third country"). These countries may not have the same level of data protection as the EEA. However, we are obliged to ensure that the personal data processed by us, our group companies and our partners outside the EEA are protected in the same way as if they were processed within the EEA. Therefore, if your data is processed outside the EEA, there are certain safeguards in place.
In this case, we will provide suitable guarantees to ensure that the respective service providers protect the data appropriately, such as entering into the EU model clauses with the recipient of such data. We ensure similar protection by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
Your personal data will be transferred to countries whose level of data protection is considered appropriate by the European Commission according to art. 45 GDPR;
We use the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU and carry out Transfer Impact Assessment for each personal data transfer outside the EEA and assess whether the laws and practices of the third country offer a level of protection substantially equivalent to that of the EEA;
An exception as set out in art. 49 GDPR;
Other safeguards as specified in art. 46 GDPR.
Your personal data may be processed in the United States of America (US), United Kingdom (UK), India and Turkey.
For personal data processing in the US, India and Turkey we enter into the data processing agreements and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses based on the European Commission Implementing Decision of June 4, 2021 (EU 2021/914). Furthermore, we carry out Transfer Impact Assessments to make sure that our group companies and business partners provide adequate protection of personal data.
For processing taking place in the United Kingdom, we rely on the European Commission adequacy decision to transfer personal data.
Data retention
Your personal data will be stored and retained for us in accordance with the applicable laws on data protection, and to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out under this Privacy Policy or resulting from such laws. We retain personal data we collect from you to provide you with our services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. For example:
for marketing communications, we will keep your personal data until the withdrawal of your consent; or
for your personal data necessary for the performance of a contract, we will keep such data for the duration of our contractual relationship.
When it is no longer necessary to process your personal data for the purposes for which it is processed, we will either aggregate, delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Privacy Policy, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
Automated decision processing
We use technologies involving algorithms and automated decision processing to provide our services, based on real-time decision process or on analytics or the categorization of various usage of our service. However, we will not make any automated decisions about an individual which would produce legal effects or similarly significantly effects on the data subject, unless where it is (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract, (ii) or pursuant to individual’s prior consent, or (iii) required by applicable law.
Your data privacy rights
You have the following data privacy rights:
Right to information
You have the right to receive information from us at any time, upon request, about the personal data we process that concerns you within the scope of Art. 15 GDPR. To do this, you can send a request by post or email to the addresses below.

For example, we may retain personal data for legal, tax or accounting purposes or for the prevention of fraud.
Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to demand that we restrict processing in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR. This right exists in particular if the accuracy of the personal data is disputed between the user and us, for the period of time required to verify the accuracy, as well as in the event that the user requests restricted processing instead of erasure in the case of an existing right to erasure; furthermore, in the event that the data is no longer necessary for the purposes pursued by us, but the user requires it for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims, as well as if the successful exercise of an objection is still disputed between us and the user. To exercise your right to restrict processing, please contact us at the addresses below.

We will stop processing your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.

We may share data that is de-identified or aggregated without limitation.
How is data used for digital advertising & analytics?
We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“
Advertising Providers
”) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the App and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
To opt out of Getir’s collection, use, and transfer of data for interest-based advertising on the App, you may download the DAA’s AppChoices application from the Android or iOS app store on your mobile device. You also can use “Limit Ad Tracking” in your iOS settings or “Opt out of interest-based ads” in your Android settings to limit Getir’s collection of data for interest-based advertising. Note that electing to opt out from interest-based advertising will not stop advertising from appearing in your applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or device, or reset your mobile advertising identifier, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the App and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes. Getir uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the App and for analytics and marketing purposes. For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use the App, visit
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners
, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit
tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
How does Getir keep data secure?
We use appropriate security measures designed to protect the data that we collect and process about you.
Third-Party Links and Tools
The App may provide links to third-party websites or apps. We do not control the privacy practices of those websites or apps, and they are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should review the privacy policies of other websites or apps that you use to learn about their data practices.
The App also includes integrated social media tools or “plug-ins,” such as by allowing you to log in through social media features offered by third parties. If you use these tools to share data or you otherwise interact with these features on the App, those companies may collect data about you and may use and share such information in accordance with your account settings, including by sharing such data with the general public.
Your interactions with third-party companies and your use of their features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide those features. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of any accounts you create and use.
Your Choices
To opt out of our email marketing, you can use the link provided at the bottom of each marketing message.

Got questions?
Why do I need a link in bio tool?
Right now, every time you’ve got something new to share, you have to go to every single one of your channels to change the link in each of your bios. It’s time-consuming and complicated – making it so much harder to keep everything up to date.
A link in bio tool means you never have to compromise, or remove one link from your bio so you can add another. You can keep everything you want to share online in one link. When you’ve got a change, you only ever have to make it once.
Is Linktree the original link in bio tool?
The short answer? Yes!
Back in 2016, we created Linktree as an easy way to link out to all socials and unify digital ecosystems, pioneering the link-in-bio category. Linktree remains the leading, biggest and most popular link-in-bio solution – but that’s just the beginning.  You can use your Linktree URL or QR code
anywhere
your audience is, including on your business cards, in your email signature, on paper-based posters and brochures, and even on your resumé. If you don’t have a website, that’s fine. If you have a Linktree, you don’t need one!
Can you get paid and sell things from a Linktree?
Yes, you can! We offer plenty of ways to sell products and monetize your audience. You can collect tips, request payments for services, collect revenue from affiliate links, and sell your products right in your Linktree.
A lot of Linktree creators see incredible results with online sales on Linktree, because it removes the extra steps involved in a purchase. With Paypal or Square right in your Linktree, your customers won’t even need to leave your social media to go to another site and pay!
“We love how Linktree has helped us manage our business by having all social media and ways to pay in one location. The QR code has made it easy for customers to access it all!”
– Tiffany
Is Linktree safe to use on all of my social media profiles?
Linktree is trusted by all social platforms, and is even used on many of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok’s own social media accounts! Because Linktree is the original and most popular link-in-bio tool, the linktr.ee URL is a trusted, identifiable and familiar link that audiences feel comfy and safe clicking on.
What makes Linktree better than the other link in bio options?
We have our own opinions here, of course, but the stories of the people who use Linktree matter more. Let’s hear what they have to say:
“Four months into creating, someone messaged me like: You need a Linktree. I can’t remember what I was using at the time, but it was one of those ones that were
supposed
to be easy. Once I got Linktree set up, I was like, oh my god – why did I spend $100 on a website? I don’t need all of that! Now, I can see the monetization of my following becoming a full-time thing.” – David Coleman
”It’s so much easier to set up and have all of your links in one place in a well designed format.” – Catie T
”Websites are cool (I have one) but Linktrees just make it so much easier.” – Tan Nguyen
“I love their analytics. Other link-in-bio companies don’t provide extensive data on what’s going on.” – Riley Lemon
Linktree invented the bio link tool in 2016, and it continues to be the world’s most popular bio link to this day – with 50M+ people using it as their trusted place to
share
,
sell
and
grow
online.

How can I drive more traffic to and through my Linktree?
Sharing your Linktree on every social platform you have makes it easy for your most important content to be seen and engaged with by all of your followers. You can even use QR codes to generate online traffic in offline places, and drive people to your links.
Once visitors arrive on your Linktree, easy-to-understand analytics help you quickly and easily discover where they’re coming from, and what they’re clicking on. You can immediately see what’s working and what’s not and improve your Linktree on the fly with different link placement, prioritized links, subheadings, animation and more to make sure your traffic is landing exactly where you want it!
How many links should I have on my Linktree?
This depends on two things. If your priority is click-throughs and conversion, we recommend having 3-7 links on your Linktree at once (based on our most successful creators). Including too many options for your visitors slows down their course of action.
That said: for certain creators whose priority is display, education and showcasing (e.g. a record label with a library of new releases to promote, or a management company looking to showcase their full roster of clients), including more than seven links fulfils their purpose perfectly.
You can use features on Linktree to add subheadings, sections, animation and other prioritisation methods to your links – so no matter how many things you’ve got to share, you can drive your visitors to what’s most important, first.
Do I need a website to use Linktree?
No, you don’t! Linktree can act as your very own mini-website to share, sell and grow without any of the time and effort it takes to build and maintain a regular website. You can create a design that fully reflects your personality and brand in seconds, with no knowledge, skills or experience needed. If you already have a website, that’s great: you can add it to your Linktree.
“I hardly touch my website any more. I just send people to my Linktree! It’s a good-looking, fresh interface… so much more dynamic. I can take a few minutes, update my links and put my phone away rather than spending 45 struggling on WordPress.” –
