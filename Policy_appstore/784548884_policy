What do we use your personal data for?
Essential Information
The main way we use your personal data is to fulfil your booking (be it a flight booking or a holiday booking) to help us understand your needs and to provide you with a better service. If you create a myJet2 account and update your personal details in the account details section we will also use your personal data to maintain this account. We may store information about your travel history and your preferences. We may also use your personal data for marketing purposes, but we will make sure to not send you communications with offers and information if you have told us you would prefer not to receive these.
Detailed Information
As well as to fulfil your flight or holiday booking and to provide you with updates about your booking, we use your information in the following ways:
Marketing communications
marketing via SMS, email, letter or phone: We (including our group companies) may use your personal data to inform you, by email, letter or phone or SMS, about offers, products and services that we think may be of interest to you and we may tell you about other organisations' products and services. If you do not wish to receive these communications, please let us know. You can change your mind at any time by visiting our unsubscribe page here
https://www.jet2holidays.com/unsubscribe
or
https://www.jet2.com/unsubscribe
.
You can also unsubscribe following the instructions that we will include in any communication, such as email or text, we send to you;
Please note that if you sign up to our myJet2 account and opt-in to email marketing, you will receive emails from myJet2, Jet2.com and Jet2holidays for both flights and holidays, however if you sign up only to Jet2.com marketing emails or Jet2holidays emails, you will only receive emails directly from that brand.

We may also use your personal data to suppress or remove you from our marketing campaigns within these platforms. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on social media platforms. If you do not wish to receive such targeted marketing generally, you are able to switch this off within the social media site. If you do not want to receive such targeted marketing from us, you can contact us at:
privacy@jet2.com
;
for marketing on other media: We may use your personal data to generate targeted marketing or suppress or remove you from our marketing campaigns via other media platforms (such as TV On Demand services). If you do not want to receive such targeted marketing from us, you can contact us at:

Jet2
app, on your mobile device or web browser. If you do not want to receive such push notifications from us, you can change your permissions via your mobile device settings or browser at any time;
Marketing Analysis or research
to develop our customer insights: we use personal data  you have provided to us through your interactions with us (for example, through booking your holiday or flight with us; or using our website or interacting with our communications; or which we have received from one of our partners) to develop a single view of you as our customer, improve the products and services we provide and keep you informed about offerings that may be of interest to you. This also helps inform business decisions, for example to ensure that we are providing holidays or flights that our customers want;
we may use your personal data to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns so we can make sure that our advertising reaches our customers;
for market research: from time to time, we may also use your information to contact you by letter, phone, SMS, email or in-app to conduct customer satisfaction surveys or similar market research exercises;
to help us design our websites and improve or personalise your experience and communications: we may collect information about the way you use and access our websites. Our web system collects information about each visitor, including IP address, device identifiers, the length of time spent on the website and the order in which pages are visited.

You can update your cookies preferences at any time. For more information, please refer to the cookies section
here.
To speak to you regarding your booking or any other enquiry:
we may use your personal data to respond to and deal with any complaint or query or request which you contact us with.

Where does your personal data come from?
Essential Information
Most of the data we process about you comes from you, for example, information you provide to us so that we can fulfil your travel booking.
Other information is gathered during your use of our websites (e.g. IP addresses or information obtained via cookies or similar technologies), via your interactions with our communications and from your interaction with us at airports and hotels (e.g. data we may receive from airport check-in systems). If you have a myJet2 account, we will retain information about your visit – for example when you last logged in.
Detailed Information
A lot of the data we process is data which you provide to us, such as your name, contact details, payment card information, date of birth etc. You usually provide this information when you make a booking via our websites or call centre, or when you contact us via email, letter or phone. You also have the option to provide this information if you set up a myJet2 account, all of which you can update yourself in your account.
We may also obtain your personal data from other companies that we partner with, such as retail partners (for example for travel insurance or car hire) or other third parties that we use to provide us or you services. We may also use personal data from other sources which supply publicly available information.
If you use social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, booking engines or personal banking sites, these sites are operated by third party providers and they may share your personal data with us. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings of such information sharing platforms. We will respect any permissions you have set on those platforms regarding our use of your personal information.
Cookies
Essential Information
Similar to other commercial websites, our websites utilise a standard technology to collect information about how our website is used by individual devices connected to the internet.
This information is gathered through "Cookies" (or similar technologies) which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies may collect personal information about you. These small files allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, monitor website traffic and to personalise the content of the site for you. This ultimately helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse our websites and improve the content of our marketing and allows us to improve our site going forward. Within our app we use integrated Software Development Kits (SDK’s) to understand how users interact with our app (in a similar way to how we use cookies), to identify and fix issues and improve the user experience.
To find out more about our use of cookies  or manage your cookies preferences, please read our cookies policy

Do you have to provide your personal data?
Essential Information
In most cases, providing your personal data to us is optional, however, if you do not provide it, we will probably not be able to fulfil your booking. For example, if you book a flight with us, we need details such as your name and passport details to be able to complete your booking and we will need your payment card details to take your payment. When you make a booking, we will only collect information which is required for the purpose of your booking. In other cases, you have a choice over whether we collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on your browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case you may not be able to use all parts of our website). Sometimes, we are required by law to collect certain data for border control purposes and where you have booked a flight with us you cannot prevent this collection of data other than by choosing not to check-in for this flight.

What are the legal grounds for processing your personal data?
Essential Information
Data protection laws require us to tell you what legal basis we use for processing your personal data. These bases are set out in the applicable data protection law. We generally use the following grounds:
the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (i.e. the contract for the sale and purchase of your flight or holiday), or to take steps requested by you before entering into this contract;
the processing is in our or someone else's legitimate interests, and these interests are not overridden by your interests or rights in the protection of your personal data;

the processing is necessary to meet a legal obligation which applies to us.
Sometimes we process data about you which the law considers to fall within special categories (see section "What personal data do we process?" for more details), in which case, we use one of the following grounds:
the processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person where you are physically or legally incapable of giving consent (e.g. in the event of a medical emergency);
the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of EU or domestic law; or

Who do we share your personal data with?
Essential Information
We share your personal information with our chosen third party suppliers who provide services to you and us (for example, hotels, tour operators etc); with local border control and law enforcement agencies (for example for fraud prevention or immigration control); and to other companies within the Jet2 group.
Some of these organisations may be located outside of the UK and therefore your personal data may be transferred between the UK and other countries. Where this happens, we have safeguards in place to ensure that your data is protected.
We are committed to the health and safety of our customers in managing the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and will be working closely with health authorities, government agencies and our local agents, hotels and suppliers to secure appropriate assistance and support. As part of these efforts, we may ask for or share information with these third parties about customers who are in, or who may have travelled through, impacted areas. We will do this solely as necessary to help manage your safety and the safety of others.
Detailed Information
The types of third party service providers who we share your data with include;
·
Third party suppliers that we work with to provide your flight, holiday or any other service you buy from us (e.g. hotels, transport companies, local operators excursion/attraction providers, car hire companies, travel insurance providers). We provide these parties only with the essential personal information about you that is needed to make sure your holiday runs smoothly together with any follow up information that may need to be shared to deal with incidents, complaints or feedback. We always have contracts in place with these third parties which require them to properly protect your data and only use it for the purposes of providing the particular service. Where those parties are using your personal information to provide their own services to you separate from your booking with us (for example, your chosen hotel may collect your address for their own local booking requirements or your car hire company may collect your driving licence details to meet local legal requirements) , they will be separate data controllers of that information. We would encourage you to read the individual hotel/attraction provider/etc privacy policy to understand how they handle your information and how to exercise your rights. If you purchase car hire through Jet2holidays or Jet2.com we will transfer your personal data to Rental Cars (Travel Jigsaw Limited) to provide you with car hire services. Jet2holidays and Rental Cars will be independent data controllers in respect of that information. Rental Cars will use the information in accordance with their privacy policy
https://www.jet2carhire.com/PrivacyPolicy.do
·
Third party providers we are using to provide us services, for example, to help us understand our customer behaviour or help improve our website (e.g. marketing agencies, IT developers).
·
Immigration/border control, local airports - Border agencies in certain countries require us to provide certain information such as your name and passport details as a condition of you travelling to that country. This will vary, depending on the country to which you are travelling, for example, for passengers travelling to the United States or America ("US"), we are required to transfer to the US Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") certain travel and reservation data about passengers flying between the European Union and the US in accordance with an International Agreement. US authorities use this information for preventing and combating terrorism and other transnational serious crimes. For further information please see :
www.dhs.gov
and this
PDF.
·
Law enforcement, government agencies, emergency services - If there are any incidents with disruptive passengers on board our flights, we may share personal data with law enforcement agencies. In the event of a medical emergency during a flight we may share personal data with third party service providers to call for advice for the purposes of managing and recording passenger medical issues. We also share personal information with law enforcement agencies and other organisations involved in fraud prevention and detection (such as third party fraud management solution providers, banks and financial institutions) in order to identify potentially fraudulent bookings. We may also share your information with law enforcement and government agencies where this is reasonable for the prevention and detection of crime or if we believe a claim is being made fraudulently or if we have a safeguarding concern about a child.
·
Courts, legal advisers, claims handlers - in order to assess and defend any legal claims made against us, we may share your personal information with our legal advisors and claims handlers.
·
Third party successors to our business - If we sell or buy any business or assets, we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, and if we or part of our business is acquired by a third party, personal data about our customers will be transferred to that third party.
·
ABTA or the CAA - In the event of our insolvency we, or any appointed insolvency practitioner, may disclose your personal information to the CAA, and/or ABTA so that they can assess the status of your booking and advise you on the appropriate course of action under any scheme of financial protection. The CAA’s General Privacy Notice is at
https://www.caa.co.uk/Our-work/About-us/General-privacy-notice/
ABTA’s Privacy Notice is at
https://www.abta.com/privacy-notice
.
Within the Jet2 group
We may routinely share data with Jet2 group companies based in the EU, for example with our representatives in local countries. To protect your personal data in these circumstances, we have put in place internal data protection arrangements, which include contractual protections approved by the EU for the transfer of your data.
If we transfer personal data to another country where the recipient is outside of the Jet2 group, we will only do this where we are required to do so by law, or where the country is recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection, or where we are satisfied that alternative arrangements (such as direct contractual commitments and assurances from those third parties) are in place to protect your privacy rights.
back to the top
How long do we keep your personal data for?
Essential Information
We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Privacy Policy. In some cases we may store your personal information for longer periods of time where we need to maintain an accurate record of your dealings with us to help manage complaints or claims you or others may raise, or otherwise comply with legal or regulatory requirements. If you would like to know more about how long we retain information please contact us.

Once we have received your request, we may seek to verify your identity through appropriate checks (which may include security questions or evidence of identification such as a copy of your passport).
If you are requesting a copy of personal data on behalf of a third party, please also submit to us
written authority from the individual whose data is required and a copy of their passport or driving licence. If the third party is a child under the age of 16, the written authority should come from a person with parental responsibility (along with a copy of the child’s passport).
You do not have to pay a fee for a copy of your information unless your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive, in which case we will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances. We will let you know of any charges before completing your request.
We aim to respond to you within 1 month of receiving your request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we aim to respond within 3 months.

You can ask us to correct any data which is inaccurate or incomplete. This is free of charge.
We aim to deal with requests for correction within 1 month, although it might take us up to 3 months if your request is particularly complicated.

Appropriate Policy document
Appropriate Policy Document – our processing of special categories of personal data and criminal offence data
As part of the CAA’s statutory and corporate functions, we process special category data and criminal offence data in accordance with the requirements of Article 9 and 10 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (‘DPA 2018’).
Special category data
Special category data is defined at Article 9 GDPR as personal data revealing:
Racial or ethnic origin;
Political opinions;
Religious or philosophical beliefs;
Trade union membership;
Genetic data;
Biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person;
Data concerning health; or
Data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
Criminal conviction data
Article 10 GDPR covers processing in relation to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures. In addition, section 11(2) of the DPA 2018 specifically confirms that this includes personal data relating to the alleged commission of offences or proceedings for an offence committed or alleged to have been committed, including sentencing. This is collectively referred to as ‘criminal offence data’.
This policy document
Some of the Schedule 1 conditions for processing special category and criminal offence data require us to have an Appropriate Policy Document (‘APD’) in place, setting out and explaining our procedures for securing compliance with the principles in Article 5 and policies regarding the retention and erasure of such personal data.
This document explains our processing and satisfies the requirements of Schedule 1, Part 4 of the DPA 2018.
In addition, it provides some further information about our processing of special category and criminal offence data where a policy document isn’t a specific requirement. The information supplements our
General Privacy Notice.
Our processing of special category and criminal offence data for law enforcement purposes is not covered in this document. Processing for law enforcement purposes is carried out by us in our capacity as a competent authority and falls under Part 3 of the DPA 2018. For further information please see our Safeguards Policy for sensitive law enforcement processing.
Conditions for processing special category and criminal offence data
We process special categories of personal data under the following GDPR Articles:
Article 9(2)(b) – where processing is necessary for the purposes of performing or exercising obligations or rights which are imposed or conferred by law on the CAA or the data subject in connection with employment, social security or social protection.
Examples of our processing include staff sickness absences.
Article 9(2)(g) - reasons of substantial public interest.
Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018, Part 2, Paragraph 12 - Regulatory requirements relating to unlawful acts and dishonesty etc
The Civil Aviation Authority is the statutory corporation which oversees and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the United Kingdom. Our principal functions and duties are set out in primary legislation (the Civil Aviation Act 1982, the Airports Act 1986, the Transport Act 2000 and the Civil Aviation Act 2012) and in secondary legislation (principally the Air Navigation Order 2016). Our processing of personal data in this context is for the purposes of substantial public interest and is necessary for the carrying out of our role.
Examples of our processing include the information we seek or receive as part of investigating a complaint.
Article 9(2)(j) – for archiving purposes in the public interest.
The relevant purpose we rely on is Schedule 1 Part 1 paragraph 4 – archiving.
An example of our processing is the transfers we make to the National Archives as part of our obligations under the Public Records Act 1958.
Article 9(2)(f) – for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Examples of our processing include processing relating to any employment tribunal or other litigation.
Article 9(2)(a) – explicit consent
In circumstances where we seek consent, we make sure that the consent is unambiguous and for one or more specified purposes, is given by an affirmative action and is recorded as the condition for processing.
Article 9(2)(c) – where processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
An example of our processing would be using health information about a member of staff in a medical emergency.
Article 9(2)(h) – Health or social care
An example of our processing would be using medical diagnosis during issuance of a licence.
We process criminal offence data under Article 10 of the GDPR
Examples of our processing of criminal offence data include vetting individuals we regulate, pre-employment checks and declarations by an employee in line with contractual obligations.
Processing which requires an Appropriate Policy Document
Almost all of the substantial public interest conditions in Schedule 1 Part 2 of the DPA 2018, plus the condition for processing employment, social security and social protection data, require an APD (see Schedule 1 paragraphs 1 and 5).
This section of the policy is the APD for the CAA. It demonstrates that the processing of special category (‘SC’) and criminal offence (‘CO’) data based on these specific Schedule 1 conditions is compliant with the requirements of the GDPR Article 5 principles.
Description of data processed
We process the special category data about our colleagues that is necessary to fulfil our obligations as an employer. This includes information about their health and wellbeing, ethnicity, photographs and their membership of any trade union.
Our processing for reasons of substantial public interest relates to the data we receive or obtain in order to fulfil our statutory function as a regulator. Further information about this processing can be found in our
General Privacy Notice
.
We also maintain a record of our processing activities in accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR.
Schedule 1 conditions for processing
Special category data
We process SC data for the following purposes in Part 1 of Schedule 1:
Paragraph 1(1)
employment, social security and social protection.
We process SC data for the following purposes in Part 2 of Schedule 1. All processing is for the first listed purpose and might also be for others dependent on the context:
Paragraph 6(1) and (2)(a)
statutory, etc. purposes
Paragraph 8(1)
equality of opportunity or treatment
Paragraph 10(1)
preventing or detecting unlawful acts
Paragraph 11(1) and (2)
protecting the public against dishonesty
Paragraph 12(1) and (2)
regulatory requirements relating to unlawful acts and dishonesty
Criminal offence data
We process criminal offence data for the following purposes in parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1:
Paragraph 1
– employment, social security and social protection
Paragraph 6(2)(a)
– statutory, etc. purposes
Paragraph 10(1)
– Preventing or detecting unlawful acts
Procedures for ensuring compliance with the principles
Accountability principle
We have put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet the requirements of accountability. These include:
The appointment of a data protection officer who reports directly to our highest management level.
Taking a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach to our activities.
Maintaining documentation of our processing activities.
Adopting and implementing data protection policies and ensuring we have written contracts in place with our data processors.
Implementing appropriate security measures in relation to the personal data we process.
Carrying out data protection impact assessments for our high risk processing.
We regularly review our accountability measures and update or amend them when required.
Principle (a): lawfulness, fairness and transparency
Processing personal data must be lawful, fair and transparent. It is only lawful if and to the extent it is based on law and either the data subject has given their consent for the processing, or the processing meets at least one of the conditions in Schedule 1.
We provide clear and transparent information about why we process personal data including our lawful basis for processing in our general privacy notice, colleague privacy notice and this policy document.
Our processing for purposes of substantial public interest is necessary for the exercise of a function conferred on the CAA by the legislation for which we act as a regulator e.g. The Civil Aviation Act 1982, the Airports Act 1986, the Transport Act 2000 and the Civil Aviation Act 2012 and in secondary legislation (principally the Air Navigation Order 2016).
We act as the regulator in all aspects of civil aviation in the United Kingdom.
Our processing for the purposes of employment relates to our obligations as an employer.
We also process special category personal data to comply with other obligations imposed on the CAA in its capacity as a public authority e.g. the Equality Act.
Principle (b): purpose limitation
We process personal data for purposes of substantial public interest as explained above when the processing is necessary for us to fulfil our statutory functions, where it is necessary for complying with or assisting another to comply with a regulatory requirement to establish whether an unlawful or improper conduct has occurred, to protect the public from dishonesty, preventing or detecting unlawful acts or for disclosure to elected representatives.
We are authorised by law to process personal data for these purposes. We may process personal data collected for any one of these purposes (whether by us or another controller), for any of the other purposes here, providing the processing is necessary and proportionate to that purpose.
If we are sharing data with another controller, we will document that they are authorised by law to process the data for their purpose.
We will not process personal data for purposes incompatible with the original purpose it was collected for.
Principle (c): data minimisation
We collect personal data necessary for the relevant purposes and ensure it is not excessive. The information we process is necessary for and proportionate to our purposes. Where personal data is provided to us or obtained by us, but is not relevant to our stated purposes, we will erase it.
Principle (d): accuracy
Where we become aware that personal data is inaccurate or out of date, having regard to the purpose for which it is being processed, we will take every reasonable step to ensure that data is erased or rectified without delay. If we decide not to either erase or rectify it, for example because the lawful basis we rely on to process the data means these rights don’t apply, we will document our decision.
Principle (e): storage limitation
All special category data processed by us for the purpose of employment or substantial public interest is, unless retained longer for archiving purposes, retained for the periods set out in our retention schedules. We determine the retention period for this data based on our legal obligations and the necessity of its retention for our business needs. Our retention schedule is reviewed regularly and updated when necessary.
Principle (f): integrity and confidentiality (security)
Electronic information is processed within our secure network. Hard copy information is processed in line with our security procedures.
Our electronic systems and physical storage have appropriate access controls applied.
The systems we use to process personal data allow us to erase or update personal data at any point in time where appropriate.
APD review date
This policy will be retained for the duration of our processing and for a minimum of 6 months after processing ceases.
This policy will be reviewed annually or revised more frequently if necessary.

Sensitive processing for law enforcement purpose
The CAA are responsible for enforcing UK consumer laws that apply specifically to aviation. This includes legislation relating to price transparency, contract terms, passenger rights during flight disruption and access to air travel for passengers with reduced mobility. We also have concurrent powers with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to enforce general consumer law in the aviation sector. This covers airlines, airports, tour operators and travel agents.
We also have concurrent powers with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to enforce general consumer law in the aviation sector. This covers airlines, airports, tour operators and travel agents.
The CAA also has civil powers to take enforcement action in relation to a range of passenger rights legislation and general consumer law. These powers come from Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, and the CAA can seek undertakings from businesses that require them to comply with the law. If undertakings are not provided, or are breached, the CAA can seek an Enforcement Order from the Court.
As part of the CAA’s statutory functions, we can investigate and prosecute both companies and individuals for breaches of the legislation it is tasked with enforcing, for example breaches of The Air Navigation Order 2016. Investigations into alleged breaches of the law are carried out by the Investigations & Enforcement Team, in accordance with our
Code of Practice
.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority is a competent authority for the purpose of Part 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) which applies to the processing of personal data by such authorities for law enforcement purposes.
These purposes are set out at section 31 DPA 2018 and include the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, which might include the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.
Sensitive processing
Part 3 of the DPA 2018 outlines the requirement for an Appropriate Policy Document (APD) to be in place when processing sensitive personal data for law enforcement purposes.
Sensitive processing is defined in Part 3 section 35(8) and is equivalent to GDPR special category data. This includes:
the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership;
the processing of genetic data, or of biometric data, for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual;
the processing of data concerning health;
the processing of data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual orientation.
This policy document
This policy document outlines our sensitive processing for law enforcement purposes and explains:
Our procedures for securing compliance with the law enforcement data protection principles;
Our policies as regards the retention and erasure of personal data, giving an indication of how long the personal data is likely to be retained.
Our policy document – our processing of special categories of personal data and criminal conviction data explains our general processing of special category data when our processing is not for the primary purpose of law enforcement. Additional information about our more general processing can also be found in our
general privacy notice
.
Description of data processed
We carry out sensitive processing for law enforcement purposes during Criminal Investigations into offences committed under the legislation we regulate.
We carry out sensitive processing of all of the categories of data defined in Part 3 section 35(8).
Consent or Schedule 8 condition for processing
We carry out sensitive processing under section 35(3) DPA 2018 only in reliance on the consent of the data subject or where it is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purposes and it meets one of the conditions in schedule 8 of the DPA 2018.
The relevant schedule 8 condition for our processing is Schedule 8 paragraph 1 – statutory purposes.
Where personal data is retained as a public record to be transferred to The National Archives, our condition is Schedule 8 paragraph 9 – that the processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest.
Procedures for ensuring compliance with the principles
Accountability principle
We have put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet the requirements of accountability. These include:
The appointment of a data protection officer who reports directly to our highest management level.
Taking a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach to our activities.
Maintaining documentation of our processing activities.
Adopting and implementing data protection policies and ensuring we have written contracts in place with our data processors.
Implementing appropriate security measures in relation to the personal data we process.
Carrying out data protection impact assessments for our high risk processing.
We regularly review our accountability measures and update or amend them when required.
Principle (1): lawfulness and fairness
Processing for law enforcement must be lawful and fair. Sensitive processing is only permissible if it is:
based on the consent of the data subject - section 35(4);
or
is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose and is based on a Schedule 8 condition - section 35(5).
Our processing of sensitive data for law enforcement purposes satisfies the first Schedule 8 condition that it is necessary for the exercise of a function conferred on the CAA by the legislation for which we act as a regulator e.g. The Civil Aviation Act 1982, the Airports Act 1986, the Transport Act 2000 and the Civil Aviation Act 2012 and is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. We are required to seek to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute possible offences contained in the relevant legislation.
In circumstances where we seek consent, we make sure:
The consent is unambiguous
The consent is given by an affirmative action
The consent is recorded as the condition for processing
Principle (2): purpose limitation
We process personal data for all of the law enforcement purposes listed at section 31 DPA 2018. These are the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, which might include the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. The Civil Aviation Authority is tasked by the Department for Transport to investigate and prosecute breaches of aviation safety rules and some aviation related consumer protection and health and safety requirements.
We are authorised by law to carry out sensitive processing for any of these purposes. We may process personal data collected for one of these purposes (whether by us or another controller), for any of our other law enforcement purposes providing the processing is necessary and proportionate to that purpose.
We will only use data collected for a law enforcement purpose for purposes other than law enforcement where we are authorised by law to do so.
If we are sharing data with another controller, we will document that they are authorised by law to process the data for their purpose.
Principle (3): data minimisation
We do not systematically collect or harvest sensitive personal data for law enforcement purposes. The information we process is necessary for and proportionate to our purposes. It is processed in the context of us carrying out processes which enable us to meet our stated purposes for processing.
Where sensitive personal data is provided to us or obtained by us but is not relevant to our stated purposes, we will erase it.
Principle (4): accuracy
Where we become aware that personal data is inaccurate or out of date, having regard to the purpose for which it is being processed, we will take every reasonable step to ensure that data is erased or rectified without delay. If we decide not to either erase or rectify it, we will document our decision.
We, as far as possible, distinguish between personal data based on facts and personal data based on personal assessments or opinions and mark the file to reflect the distinction. There are circumstances where this is not possible.
We, where relevant, and as far as possible, distinguish between personal data relating to different categories of data subject, such as
People suspected of committing an offence
People convicted of a criminal offence
Known or suspected victims of a criminal offence
Witnesses or other people with information about offences
We only do this where the personal data is relevant to the purpose being pursued.
We do this by marking the file in our records. Should the status of a data subject change our systems allow us to note the reason and amend the file.
We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date is not transmitted or made available for any of the law enforcement purposes. We do this by verifying any data before sending it externally. We also provide the recipient with the necessary information we hold to assess the accuracy, completeness and reliability of the data.
If we discover, after transmission that the data was incorrect or should not have been transmitted, we will tell the recipient as soon as possible.
We document our decision to make personal data available for any of the law enforcement purposes.
Principle (5): storage limitation
We have corporate retention schedules and retain information processed for the purposes of law enforcement for 6 years from closure of the matter unless there is a legitimate reason to retain it for longer.
Principle (6): security
Electronic information is processed within our secure network. Hard copy information is processed within our secure premises. Where it is necessary for us to share information with third parties we consider the technical or organisational security measures they have in place before allowing access or transmitting data.
Electronic and hard copy information processed for the law enforcement purposes is only available to staff who carry out the processing for these purposes. Our electronic systems and physical storage have appropriate access controls applied.
The systems we use to process personal data for law enforcement purposes allow us to erase or update personal data at any point in time. They also allow us to log the following information:
Collection
Alteration
Consultation (access)
Identity of person who accessed
Disclosures
Combination of records
Erasure
APD review date
This policy will be retained for the duration of our processing and for a minimum of 6 months after processing ceases.
This policy will be reviewed annually or revised more frequently if necessary.

People who call us
When you call us, we may ask for personal details for verification purposes. We use this information to make sure that we are talking to the right person and to help us locate your information. If you are making a general enquiry, we may collect personal details to return your call or to pass on information related to your case/application.

People who email us
Any email sent to us, including any attachments, may be monitored by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for reasons of security and/or monitoring compliance with CAA policies. Email monitoring or blocking software may also be used. Please be aware that it is your responsibility to ensure that any email you send to us is not in breach of any law or regulation.

People who make a complaint or report to us
When we receive a complaint or report from a person, we may create a record containing the identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved.
We will use the personal information we collect to process the complaint or report and to check on the level of service we provide. We do compile reports for internal management oversight, but minimal information is used. We will also publish, in our Annual Report, statistics showing information such as the number of complaints we receive, but not in a form which identifies anyone.
We usually disclose the identity of the complainant to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) manager in the area related to the complaint or report. This is necessary where, for example, the accuracy of a person's record is in dispute, or a report directly relates to the complainant and an investigation is required. If a complainant doesn't want information identifying them to be disclosed, we will try to respect that. However, it may not be possible to handle a complaint on an anonymous basis.
We will keep personal information contained in files in line with our retention policies. This means that information will be retained for varied amounts of time from closure depending on the type of complaint or report. It will be retained in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted according to the 'need to know' principle.
Similarly, where enquiries are submitted to us, we will use the information supplied to us to deal with the enquiry, compile internal reports and to check on the level of service we provide.
As the CAA also has a number of other specific complaints policies relevant to different CAA functions, you may wish to use further guidance for
making reports and complaints
.

People who apply to us for a service
We must hold the personal details of the people who have requested a service to provide the service. We keep records of the services provided, such as the issue of a pilot's licence, for the duration of the licence holder's aviation career and/or in accordance with applicable regulations. We are required to keep medical records for specified time periods, according to the class of medical certificate held.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) offers various services to the aviation industry, and we sometimes use third parties to assist the CAA in providing those services noted on this page. However, these third parties are only permitted to use information from applicants to complete those services, such as passenger claims handling or passenger repatriation services.
The CAA is required by law to 'notify' certain specified information to the Information Commissioner (ICO). The ICO compiles this information into a
Data Protection Register
which it is required by law to publish.

People who apply to work at the CAA
When individuals apply to work at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), we will only use the information they supply to us to process their application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example, where we want to take up a reference or obtain a 'disclosure' from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) we will not do so without informing the applicant beforehand unless the disclosure is required by law.
Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held until after the recruitment exercise has been completed. It will then be destroyed or deleted. We retain de-personalised statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities or for equality and diversity purposes, but no individuals are identifiable from that data.
Once a person has taken up employment with the CAA, we will compile a file relating to their employment. The information contained in this file will be kept secure and will only be used for purposes directly relevant to that person's employment. Once their employment with the CAA has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of our retention policy and then delete it. There is further information available on
careers and recruitment

How we use your information to make automated decisions
We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions about you or your business. This helps to make our services quick, fair, and consistent. An individual has rights over automated decisions including asking that we do not make our decision based on the automated outcome alone or ask for a person to review it.
You can contact
FOI.requests@caa.co.uk
to ask us.
Legitimate Interests
We sometimes rely on Legitimate Interests as a lawful basis to process your personal data. It is likely to be most appropriate where we use your data in ways that you would reasonably expect, and which have a minimal privacy impact. The legitimate interests can be your own interests or the interests of third parties. They can include commercial interests, individual interests, or broader societal benefits.
We rely on Legitimate Interests when communicating with you about any issue that you raise with us or that follows from an interaction between us. To provide further, related, online or email information and ongoing news updates in relation to the identified area of interest. To process purchase transactions for products and services with customers, and to ensure any transaction issues can be dealt with. To protect our websites and infrastructure from cyber-attack or other threats, and to report and deal with any illegal acts.
How long we keep your personal information
We keep your personal information for as long as you have a relationship with us and, thereafter, for specified purposes in line with our legal duties or our public functions, to respond to any questions or complaints, or to maintain records according to European or National aviation rules that apply to us. When you make an application for a service, we will tell you how long we expect to retain your personal information and why.

It is not relevant anymore, but you want us to keep it for use in legal claims.
You have already asked us to stop using your data, but you are waiting for us to tell you if we can keep on using it.
This means that it can only be used for certain things, such as legal claims or to exercise legal rights. In this situation, we would not use or share your information in other ways while it is restricted.

Complaints or queries about using your information

We would also welcome any suggestions for improving our information management procedures.

Purpose and legal basis for processing
If something has gone wrong with your holiday, and you have booked with one of our Members, we can offer you advice and potential solutions on how to resolve your problem. We have an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) service that has been designed to bring you and your travel company – the ABTA Member – together to help resolve your complaint.
ABTA Limited is approved by Government under the Alternative Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes (Competent Authorities and Information) Regulations 2015.
The legal basis we rely on for processing your personal data is your consent.
What we need?
We need information from you to bring you and the ABTA Member together. Our complaint forms are designed to prompt you to give us everything we need to understand what’s happened. It’s an online process so we need your contact details to allow us to communicate with you through our website, email and SMS text message. We will also ask you to provide the following details:
Copies of correspondence between you and the company (whether letter or email).
Copies of the replies.
A copy of the ATOL Certificate and/or confirmation invoice.
Details of any conversations with the company if they have dealt with your complaint by phone.
Why we need it?
We need to know the details of your complaint so we can review it and advise you on how to proceed.
What we do with it?
We will share the information you provide with the ABTA Member to ask them for their comments. We also use the information to check on our levels of service and to compile and publish statistics showing information like the number of complaints we receive, but not in a form that identifies anyone.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties where it is relevant to the trading practices of ABTA Member travel companies, these third parties may include law enforcement agencies (known under data protection law as “competent authorities”), or the courts, where this is necessary for law enforcement purposes, such as the prevention, investigation and detection of crime.
In any scenario, we will satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information and we will document our decision making.
How long we keep it?
We only keep your information for as long as it takes to process your complaint. We delete all of the information related to your complaint after:
One month, if you choose to close your case, or
18 months, if your case has been referred back to you and no activity has taken place, or
24 months, if you decide to use our arbitration scheme but do not complete your application, or
Six months, after the outcome of the arbitration scheme.
What are your rights?
We rely on your consent to process the personal data you give us in relation to your complaint. This means you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you do that, we will update our records immediately to reflect your wishes.
