Privacy policy
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (“Personal Information”) on the “Nova Wallet” mobile application (“Mobile Application”),
novawallet.io
website (“Website”), and any of their related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information.
Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator and Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such an entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Services. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
What information do we talk about?
For the purposes of the given document we would like to classify information into the following categories:
(i) data that is used for wallet creation, import and export (i.e., mnemonic phrase, seed, etc.) (“Sensitive Information”),
(ii) personally identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an individual) (“Personal Information”), and
(iii) non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) (“Non-Personal Information”).  This Privacy Policy covers all the categories and will tell you how we might collect and use each type.
What information do we collect?
Sensitive information
Your Sensitive information is not collected or stored by us. In particular, it is not sent anywhere, is not stored anywhere except your device and is not included in backups of the operating system or Mobile Application. We are committed to making sure your information is protected and we employ several mechanisms to keep your information safe, including on-device encryption, verification and authentication by password or biometry and securing all network connections with industry standard transport layer security. However, even with these precautions taken by us, safety of your device and your mnemonic passphrase, seed or backup data is solely your responsibility.
Personal information
You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. In other words, no Personal information is collected by our Services. This applies to all categories of users, including children under the age of 18.
Log Data
Whenever you use our Services, we collect error data and information through third party products on your phone (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your device IP-address, name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. No Sensitive Information or Personal Information is collected. Log Data will be processed securely in compliance with all relevant regulations, and will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties without your explicit consent.
Cookies
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Our Services do not use “cookies” explicitly. However, some third-party services that we might use in the app, may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for security and personalization, and for statistical purposes. Please note that you have the ability to accept or decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of the Services.
Disclosure of information
We do not share your information with anyone and for any reason.
Security Measures
In the event we become aware that the security of the Services has been compromised as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In such cases we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to them or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Services.
Do Not Track signals
Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The Services do not track its visitors over time and across third-party websites. However, some third-party websites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
Links to other resources
The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.
Changes and amendments
We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.
An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different from what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.
Acceptance of this policy
You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Services and submitting your information you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Services.
