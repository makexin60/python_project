Access and Use
.
Provision of Access: Registration
. Customer may request and initiate access to and use of the Solution by registering with Route4Me, which includes the review and acceptance of this Agreement. Subject to Customer completing registration, acceptance of this Agreement and payment of Fees (as described and defined below), unless Route4Me offers limited use and access to Customer to the Solution for a trial period without charge (a
"Trial"
), Route4Me hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in compliance with
Section 11(g)
) right to access and use the Solution during the Term (as defined below), solely for use by Customer and its Authorized Users (as defined) in accordance with this Agreement. Such use is limited to Customer's internal use. Route4Me shall provide to Customer the necessary access to the Solution for Customer to input passwords and provision network links or connections to allow Customer to access the Solution. For purposes of this Agreement

Customer is at all times responsible for its and its Authorized Users’ access to and use of the Solution and compliance with this Agreement.
Authorized Users
. If Customer has purchased a subscription to the Solution which permits access rights for multiple Authorized Users or such right is granted during a Trial, its designated Authorized Users may be permitted to set up profiles, register, link, or associate with the Customer account, which in each case, will be dependent on such Customer’s account. Customer is and will remain responsible for all use and access by any of its Authorized Users. Customer has full control over and access to its Authorized User’s accounts and profiles and information contained therein, including the right to access, restrict, modify or remove information or content contained therein, and reset passwords, without notification or consent of the applicable Authorized User. Furthermore, if Customer’s access or use is restricted or terminated, whether by Customer or Route4Me or otherwise, its Authorized User’s access and use will also be restricted or terminated without notice or consent to or from such Authorized User. Customer Data, as defined below, will be automatically and irretrievably deleted from the Route4Me production systems when Customer deletes an Authorized User.
Documentation License
. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, Route4Me hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except in compliance with
Section 11(g)
) license to use the Documentation during the Term solely for Customer's internal business purposes in connection with its use of the Solution.
Use Restrictions
. Customer shall not use the Solution for any purposes beyond the scope of the access granted in this Agreement. Customer shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, and shall not permit any Authorized Users to: (i) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Solution or Documentation, in whole or in part; (ii) rent, lease, lend, sell, license, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Solution or Documentation; (iii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to any software component of the Solution, in whole or in part; (iv) remove any proprietary notices from the Solution or Documentation; (v) stress test, penetration test, scrape, or otherwise overload or try to circumvent any components or aspects of the Solution or its parameters; or (vi) use the Solution or Documentation in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual property right or other right of any person, or that violates any applicable law, including any governmental regulations, prohibitions, sanctions or laws.
Reservation of Rights
. Route4Me reserves all rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement. Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to Customer or any third party any intellectual property rights or other right, title, or interest in or to Route4Me IP (as defined below) or any components or aspects of the Solution.
Suspension
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Route4Me may temporarily suspend Customer's and any Authorized User's access to any portion or all of the Solution if: (i) Route4Me reasonably determines that (A) there is a threat or attack on any components or aspects of the Route4Me Solution; (B) Customer's or any Authorized User's use of any of the components or aspects of the Route4Me Solution disrupts or poses a security risk to the Route4Me IP or to any other customer or vendor of Route4Me; (C) Customer, or any Authorized User, is using the Route4Me IP or Solution for fraudulent or illegal activities; (D) subject to applicable law, Customer has ceased to continue its business in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of its assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding; or (E) Route4Me's determines that its provision of the Solution to Customer or any Authorized User is prohibited by applicable law; (ii) any vendor of Route4Me has suspended or terminated Route4Me's access to or use of any third-party services or products required to enable Customer to access the Solution; or (iii) in accordance with

"Customer Data"
). Customer agrees that Route4Me may (i) make Aggregated Statistics publicly available in compliance with applicable law, and (ii) use Aggregated Statistics to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable law; provided that such Aggregated Statistics do not identify Customer or Customer's Confidential Information.
Customer Responsibilities
.
General
. Customer is responsible and liable for all uses of the Solution and Documentation resulting from access provided by Customer, directly or indirectly, whether such access or use is permitted by or in violation of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users, and any act or omission by an Authorized User that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by Customer will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Customer. Customer shall make all Authorized Users aware of this Agreement's provisions as applicable to such Authorized User's use of the Solution, and shall cause Authorized Users to comply with such provisions.
Customer Data
. Customer or its Authorized Users may submit Customer Data, including addresses and/or routes, for use in connection with the Solution in its sole discretion. Customer understands and agrees that Route4Me does not control Customer Data (or the submission thereof) in any manner and submission, access to and use of Customer Data by Customer or its Authorized Users is in Customer’s sole discretion. Customer hereby warrants that Customer has the right to submit, share and use all Customer Data input or submitted to or through the Solution by it or its Authorized Users. Customer further understands and agrees that the Solution may include areas available to the general public, shared areas available to Authorized Users and private areas, and sharing of any Customer Data in these areas of the Solution may result in Customer Data being shared in a public space or forum, no fault to Route4Me. All access to, processing, collection or use of personal information pertaining to a Customer or that of its Authorized Users will be managed as described in the
Privacy Policy
.
Third-Party Products
. Route4Me may from time to time make third-party products available to Customer. If such access to or use of a third party product is optional to Customer (and not fully integrated into the Route4Me services), then Customer’s access to or use of such third party product will be subject to the third party’s own terms and conditions. If Customer does not agree to abide by the applicable terms for any such third-party products, then Customer should not install or use such third-party products.
Support
. The access rights granted hereunder entitle Customer to the support services during the Term described on Route4Me’s website:
https://support.route4me.com
.
Fees and Payment
.
Fees and Payment
. At the time of purchase, Customer must submit a valid form of payment for the payment of the applicable fees for the chosen Solution, as further set forth on Route4Me’s website or as otherwise set forth under an agreed invoice (
"Invoice"
) issued by Route4Me or its partner (
"Fees"
), unless Customer is granted the right to try the Solution or components thereof via a Trial. Where applicable, Customer hereby authorizes Route4Me or its partner (as applicable) to deduct such fees each month or as otherwise set forth in the Invoice for the access to and use of the Solutions. If Fees are not received when due (whether or not such fees is paid directly by Customer to Route4Me or through a third party), without limiting Route4Me's other rights and remedies: (i) Route4Me may charge interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law; (ii) Customer shall reimburse Route4Me for all costs incurred by Route4Me in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys' fees, court costs, and collection agency fees; and (iii) if such failure continues for seven (7) days or more, Route4Me may suspend or cancel Customer's and its Authorized Users' access to any portion or all of the Solution until such amounts are paid in full. Route4Me may permanently delete all Customer’s and Authorized Users data for non-payment from the Solution’s production systems. Any use or access to the Solution during a Trial will be limited to the specified limited period, and in all cases, provided on an As-Is basis without any warranty or guarantee whatsoever.
Changes to Fees
. Customer is responsible for all charges associated with use of and access to the Solution. Any currency exchange settlements are based on Customer’s agreement with its payment method provider. Route4Me may change the price of the Solution or different features from time to time. However, if a specific time length and rate has been agreed and is set forth in an Invoice, then that rate will remain in force for that specified time. After such time period, and upon at least thirty (30) days prior notification from Route4Me of a rate change, the new rate will apply. If Customer does not agree to the rate change, Customer must cancel and stop using the Solution prior to the date that the price change takes effect, otherwise the new rates shall apply going forward.
User Requirements
. The Solution is intended as a planning and dispatch tool for each designated Authorized User with fees being based on the number of Authorized Users, vehicles or other billing units, as applicable. Customer’s or Authorized User’s attempt to or use of the Solution for the benefit of persons who are not designated Authorized Users or in excess of the applicable billing until without paying for such use is not permitted. As a result, in addition to other terms or restrictions which may be described in an Invoice, the following User Requirements apply: Each Authorized User is limited to: (i) one route for one driver (who is an Authorized User) during a given time (i.e., printing routes for non-Authorized Users is not permitted) or (ii) a reasonable number of activities (i.e. stops, routes, etc.) per month, per driver (which may differ depending on the use case scenario), or (iii) other criteria of which Route4Me (or a partner if applicable) becomes aware which exceeds the general intent of the right to use the Solution in Route4Me’s discretion. If Route4Me (or a partner if applicable) determines or reasonably suspects violation of these User Requirements has occurred, upon notice to Customer, it has the right to charge for overages at the same rate as Customer is already paying, or to suspend access to and use of the Solution or charge additional fees to Customer for such use.
Taxes
. All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Customer is responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on Route4Me's income.
Confidential Information
. From time to time during the Term, either party may disclose or make available to the other party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, that is marked, designated, or otherwise identified as "confidential" at the time of disclosure or within thirty (30) days thereafter (collectively,
"Confidential Information"
). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder or otherwise, Confidential Information of Route4Me shall at all times include non-public information pertaining to its technology, software, databases, applications and support with regard to its provision of the Solutions. Confidential Information does not include information that, at the time of disclosure is: (a) in the public domain; (b) known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure; (c) rightfully obtained by the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a third party; or (d) independently developed by the receiving party. The receiving party shall not disclose the disclosing party's Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the receiving party's personnel who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (i) in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (ii) to establish a party's rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings. On the expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving party shall promptly return to the disclosing party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each party's obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire three years from the date first disclosed to the receiving party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.

Limitations of Liability
. IN NO EVENT WILL ROUTE4ME BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, AND OTHERWISE, FOR ANY: (a) CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, ENHANCED, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; (b) INCREASED COSTS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR LOST BUSINESS, PRODUCTION, REVENUES, OR PROFITS; (c) LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION; (d) USE, INABILITY TO USE, LOSS, INTERRUPTION, DELAY, OR RECOVERY OF ANY DATA, OR BREACH OF DATA OR SYSTEM SECURITY; OR (e) COST OF REPLACEMENT GOODS OR SERVICES, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ROUTE4ME WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE.

Miscellaneous
.
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement, together with the
Privacy Policy
, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.
Notices
. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a
"Notice"
) must be in writing and addressed to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Invoice (or to such other address that may be designated by the party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section).

Force Majeure
. In no event shall Route4Me be liable to Customer, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement, if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond Route4Me's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, natural disasters, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.

Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction
.

Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the rights granted hereunder will be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Delaware in each case located in the state of Delaware, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or otherwise, Route4Me may enforce this Agreement in any court of the world.
Assignment
. Customer may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Route4Me.

This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
Export Regulation
. Customer shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules (including all regulations pertaining to sanctions), and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), that prohibit, restrict or condition the export or re-export of the Solution or any Customer Data outside the US.
US Government Rights
. Each of the Documentation and the software components that constitute the Solution is a "commercial product" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if Customer is an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, Customer only receives those rights with respect to the Solution and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government users and their contractors.
Equitable Relief
. Each party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such party of any of its obligations under
Section 5
or may cause the other party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.
Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is deemed an original, but all of which together are deemed to be one and the same agreement.
