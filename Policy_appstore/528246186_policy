PROTECTING YOUR CONTENT
TheBible.org uses multiple security measures to protect your content:
Secure location: Security begins with physical security. Our servers are located within a highly-secure facility in the USA.
Secure communication: We use SSL to encrypt all communication between users and our servers. This prevents someone from listening in and doing something untoward with that content. As of July 1, 2016.
Request size: As another content-protection measure, we limit request size to one chapter.
Human validation: When we suspect that chapter requests are not from a human, we stop and use re-CAPTCHA to verify that he is indeed human.
Human intervention: When a possible threat is detected, our support team is notified immediately; they investigate and promptly activate additional defensive measures (including blocking that server until the matter is resolved).
