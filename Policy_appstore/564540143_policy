Fingersoft’s development partners
Fingersoft may publish games developed or maintained by other game development companies. These development partners may process your personal data for the purposes described herein and where applicable, working as joint controllers of the processed data together with Fingersoft.

International data transfers
Our Services are global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Privacy Policy. Adequate safeguards to ensure your rights include utilizing and enforcing the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.
Data retention
We will keep your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected, including to provide you with the Services or to comply with any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We periodically delete or de-identify inactive accounts or other data in our Services.
After the applicable retention period, we will either delete or de-identify your personal data or, if neither deletion or de-identification is possible (for example, due to data being stored on a backup server), isolate your data from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible. We may continue to use any data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregated data).
How we protect your data
In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.
All data security measures are adopted in order to provide a level of security appropriate for the degree of risk involved. These measures are designed to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration as well as unauthorized disclosure or access. The specific measures typically include, encryption in transit, pseudonymization of identifying data where feasible, controls to limit access to services or systems that contain personal data, and maintaining procedures to handle any suspected security incidents. Please consider that the internet is an inherently insecure environment and we cannot guarantee absolute security for your data.
Your rights and options

You have the right to a copy of your personal information to be supplied to you in an electronic format upon request.
You also have the right to correct your data, have your data deleted, object to how we use or share your data, and the right to restrict how we use or share your data.

12. Dispute Resolution
This Section “Dispute Resolution” constitutes an agreement between Fingersoft and you
. You and Fingersoft agree that the processes for dispute resolution described in this agreement will apply to any dispute or claims related to these Terms, the Fingersoft Privacy Policy, or the Services. Disputes include any claims of any kind, including but not limited to legal, equitable, or statutory claims. Processes for dispute resolution will apply even if you stop using your account, delete your account, or stop using the Services. They will also apply to disputes that arose before we entered into this agreement.
Sections 12.1 to 12.7 only apply to residents of the United States or Canada. They do not apply to you if you are a resident of any other country.
12.1 Informal Dispute Resolution
You must try to informally resolve any dispute directly with Fingersoft for at least thirty days before starting an arbitration. The period for informal dispute resolution starts when you have given notice to Fingersoft of the dispute via email to legal-disputes@fingersoft.com.
12.2 Arbitration Agreement
Either you or Fingersoft may choose to submit any dispute for resolution exclusively by final and binding arbitration unless the claim is within the exceptions described elsewhere in these Terms. If you or Fingersoft bring a claim in court that can be resolved by arbitration as specified in this arbitration agreement, then either party has the right to ask the court to order the parties to resolve the claim by arbitration. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to decide whether any portion of Section 12 “Dispute Resolution” is valid or enforceable, or whether it applies to a claim and whether a claim is arbitrable.
An arbitration proceeding will be held before a neutral arbitrator.
This means you and Fingersoft agree to give up the right to resolve the dispute in a trial before a judge or jury.
Arbitration has different rules than more formal lawsuits. For example, the ability to force the other side to share information may be more limited than the process called discovery in formal lawsuits. After the arbitrator decides the outcome, that decision will be final. You or Fingersoft can ask the arbitrator to put a decision or award and the reasons for it in writing. Either you or Fingersoft can ask a court to confirm or enter the arbitrator’s final decision or award, which will make it the same as a court judgment. You and Fingersoft will generally not be able to change the outcome of arbitration through courts outside of very limited circumstances.
12.3. Arbitration Process
The arbitration will be run by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be governed by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and, as applicable, the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as any such may be modified by these Terms and by the AAA. If there is a conflict between these Terms and AAA’s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms. To review AAA’s Rules or to start arbitration, you can go to AAA’s website at www.adr.org/rules. If either of us decides to start arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written demand for arbitration as specified in the AAA rules.
The fees for arbitration will be determined by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the arbitrator decides that those fees are excessive, Fingersoft will pay the fees. Each side will pay their own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the claims allow for the prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees and costs, in which case the arbitrator may award them under the applicable law. If either party unsuccessfully challenges the validity of the arbitrator’s decision or award through a subsequent court case, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party’s costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the challenge.
The arbitration will take place either in San Francisco, California, USA or in the county or province where you reside. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.
12.4. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate
You and Fingesoft agree that the arbitration agreement in Section 12 will not apply in the following disputes:
Claims about Fingersoft’s intellectual property, such as claims to enforce, protect, or concerning the validity of Fingersoft’s copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, patents, trade secrets, or any other other intellectual property rights.
Claims related to piracy or tortious interference.
Claims that are not subject to arbitration agreement as a matter of law and are not preempted by federal law that would allow for an agreement to arbitration.
Claims in small claims court.
Any dispute not subject to arbitration under these exceptions shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction as described in Section 13 “Venue for Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration”.
12.5. No Class Actions
You and Fingersoft agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.
That means:
You or Fingersoft cannot bring a claim against the otheras a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.
The arbitrator cannot combine any other person’s claims with yours into a single case or preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding.
The arbitrator’s decision or award in your case will not apply to anyone else and cannot be used to decide other people’s disputes.
To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Fingersoft agree that in the event that there are twenty five (25) or more individual demands for arbitration of a substantially similar nature filed against Fingersoft by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations or representation is consistent or coordinated across the cases, all such demands for arbitration are processed in accordance with AAA´s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules for consumer mass arbitration. The cases will be heard on the documents, rather than by in-person, telephone, or video conference hearings. Multiple cases can be assigned to one arbitrator. The arbitration will be based on the submission of documents and there shall be no in-person or oral hearing. This mass arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class or collective action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision.
If this Section 12.4 “No class actions” is found to be unenforceable or invalid, then the entirety of Section 12 shall be void.
12.6. Opt-Out of Arbitration Agreement an No Class Action Provisions
You can choose to opt out of and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement and No Class Action provisions above (Sections 12.1. to 12.5.) by sending a written notice of your decision to opt out to legal-disputes@fingersoft.com with the subject line “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT”. You must send us this notice within thirty days of your first use of the Service or availability of this opt-out, whichever is later. If you do not send us a notice within that time, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these Sections.

12.7 Amendments to the Arbitration Agreement
Fingersoft will provide 30-days’ notice of any changes to this Section 12 through the Services or via other similar means. Changes to this Section 12 will become effective on the 30th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.

We may continue to use any data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregated data).
How we protect your data
In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.
All data security measures are adopted in order to provide a level of security appropriate for the degree of risk involved. These measures are designed to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration as well as unauthorized disclosure or access. The specific measures typically include, encryption in transit, pseudonymization of identifying data where feasible, controls to limit access to services or systems that contain personal data, and maintaining procedures to handle any suspected security incidents. Please consider that the internet is an inherently insecure environment and we cannot guarantee absolute security for your data.

12. Dispute Resolution
This Section “Dispute Resolution” constitutes an agreement between Fingersoft and you
. You and Fingersoft agree that the processes for dispute resolution described in this agreement will apply to any dispute or claims related to these Terms, the Fingersoft Privacy Policy, or the Services. Disputes include any claims of any kind, including but not limited to legal, equitable, or statutory claims. Processes for dispute resolution will apply even if you stop using your account, delete your account, or stop using the Services. They will also apply to disputes that arose before we entered into this agreement.
Sections 12.1 to 12.7 only apply to residents of the United States or Canada. They do not apply to you if you are a resident of any other country.
12.1 Informal Dispute Resolution
You must try to informally resolve any dispute directly with Fingersoft for at least thirty days before starting an arbitration. The period for informal dispute resolution starts when you have given notice to Fingersoft of the dispute via email to legal-disputes@fingersoft.com.
12.2 Arbitration Agreement
Either you or Fingersoft may choose to submit any dispute for resolution exclusively by final and binding arbitration unless the claim is within the exceptions described elsewhere in these Terms. If you or Fingersoft bring a claim in court that can be resolved by arbitration as specified in this arbitration agreement, then either party has the right to ask the court to order the parties to resolve the claim by arbitration. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to decide whether any portion of Section 12 “Dispute Resolution” is valid or enforceable, or whether it applies to a claim and whether a claim is arbitrable.
An arbitration proceeding will be held before a neutral arbitrator.
This means you and Fingersoft agree to give up the right to resolve the dispute in a trial before a judge or jury.
Arbitration has different rules than more formal lawsuits. For example, the ability to force the other side to share information may be more limited than the process called discovery in formal lawsuits. After the arbitrator decides the outcome, that decision will be final. You or Fingersoft can ask the arbitrator to put a decision or award and the reasons for it in writing. Either you or Fingersoft can ask a court to confirm or enter the arbitrator’s final decision or award, which will make it the same as a court judgment. You and Fingersoft will generally not be able to change the outcome of arbitration through courts outside of very limited circumstances.
12.3. Arbitration Process
The arbitration will be run by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be governed by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and, as applicable, the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as any such may be modified by these Terms and by the AAA. If there is a conflict between these Terms and AAA’s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms. To review AAA’s Rules or to start arbitration, you can go to AAA’s website at www.adr.org/rules. If either of us decides to start arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written demand for arbitration as specified in the AAA rules.
The fees for arbitration will be determined by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the arbitrator decides that those fees are excessive, Fingersoft will pay the fees. Each side will pay their own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the claims allow for the prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees and costs, in which case the arbitrator may award them under the applicable law. If either party unsuccessfully challenges the validity of the arbitrator’s decision or award through a subsequent court case, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party’s costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the challenge.
The arbitration will take place either in San Francisco, California, USA or in the county or province where you reside. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.
12.4. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate
You and Fingesoft agree that the arbitration agreement in Section 12 will not apply in the following disputes:
Claims about Fingersoft’s intellectual property, such as claims to enforce, protect, or concerning the validity of Fingersoft’s copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, patents, trade secrets, or any other other intellectual property rights.
Claims related to piracy or tortious interference.
Claims that are not subject to arbitration agreement as a matter of law and are not preempted by federal law that would allow for an agreement to arbitration.
Claims in small claims court.
Any dispute not subject to arbitration under these exceptions shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction as described in Section 13 “Venue for Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration”.
12.5. No Class Actions
You and Fingersoft agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.
That means:
You or Fingersoft cannot bring a claim against the otheras a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.
The arbitrator cannot combine any other person’s claims with yours into a single case or preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding.
The arbitrator’s decision or award in your case will not apply to anyone else and cannot be used to decide other people’s disputes.
To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Fingersoft agree that in the event that there are twenty five (25) or more individual demands for arbitration of a substantially similar nature filed against Fingersoft by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations or representation is consistent or coordinated across the cases, all such demands for arbitration are processed in accordance with AAA´s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules for consumer mass arbitration. The cases will be heard on the documents, rather than by in-person, telephone, or video conference hearings. Multiple cases can be assigned to one arbitrator. The arbitration will be based on the submission of documents and there shall be no in-person or oral hearing. This mass arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class or collective action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision.
If this Section 12.4 “No class actions” is found to be unenforceable or invalid, then the entirety of Section 12 shall be void.
12.6. Opt-Out of Arbitration Agreement an No Class Action Provisions
You can choose to opt out of and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement and No Class Action provisions above (Sections 12.1. to 12.5.) by sending a written notice of your decision to opt out to legal-disputes@fingersoft.com with the subject line “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT”. You must send us this notice within thirty days of your first use of the Service or availability of this opt-out, whichever is later. If you do not send us a notice within that time, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these Sections. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Fingersoft also will not be bound by them.
12.7 Amendments to the Arbitration Agreement
