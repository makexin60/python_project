Privacy Policy
All routes added to the BikeGPX app are uploaded to the BikeGPX server for processing and to allow access from other devices.
Copies of your routes may be stored on the BikeGPX server indefinitely.
If you choose to do so, a publicly accessible web page will be created for any route you upload, allowing anyone to access and download your route data.
BikeGPX relies on third party services for mapping data. As you use the app, the process of loading map data may diverge your location and IP address to these services.
Liability note
This policy represents a non-binding pledge to take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of your data as desribed above. It does not represent a guarantee or warranty, and no liability will be accepted.
This policy may be clarified or amended in the future, as necessary.
