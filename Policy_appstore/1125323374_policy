Privacy Policy
This privacy policy sets out how we collect and use personal information about you ("personal data"), in accordance with:
national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation in the UK, including the Data Protection Act 2018 (which implemented the UK version of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018); and
the EU version of the General Data Protection Regulation (where applicable).
These are referred to, throughout this privacy policy, as the "Data Protection Legislation".
We wish to be as open and transparent as possible about how we collect, process and use personal data, so please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
By using our website, products and services and/or otherwise providing us with personal data you agree that this privacy policy will apply to you.
Please note that we may change this privacy policy by updating these pages so do check back from time to time for the most current version. This privacy policy was last updated on 6th July 2021.
About us
intelligentgolf Ltd ("we", "us", "our" and "ours") is a provider of club software management systems and services. We are registered in England under company number 3988391 and our registered office is at 10-12 Eastcheap, London, EC3M 1AJ. We are a member of the ClearCourse Partnership LLP group of companies.
1.1
For the purpose of the Data Protection Legislation and this privacy policy, when:
1.1.1
we have a direct contract with you for our products and services or where you provide your personal data directly to us (in circumstances where we are not acting on behalf of someone else) for example, through use of our website, we will normally be considered to be a "data controller". This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you.
1.1.2
where we have a contract with someone else instead of directly with you, for example a contract under which we provide that business with our products and services and, in connection with that contract, they provide us with your personal data (typically this will be a contract with another business - perhaps your employer, a membership organisation or another company which is providing our products or services to you or using them to deliver their products and services to you), we will normally be considered to be a "data processor". In these circumstances, the other business will be the "data controller" and it will be responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal data about you. Our use of your personal data is governed by the terms of that contract.
1.2
Regardless of whether we are a data controller or a data processor, we take your privacy very seriously. We have appointed a person who is specifically responsible for assisting with any enquiries you may have in relation to this privacy policy or our treatment of your personal data. Their contact details are set out in section How to contact us of this privacy policy.
1.3
We have also, for the purposes of Article 27 of the EU GDPR, appointed an EU Representative. Their contact details are set out in section How to contact us of this privacy policy.
Our legal grounds for processing your Personal Data
2.1
Where we are acting as a data controller:
2.1.1
we may process your personal data to enable us to comply with any instructions you give to us or any obligations we owe to you including enabling us to perform a contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations.
2.1.2
we may also process your personal data for the purposes of our own legitimate interests (provided that those interests do not override any of your own interests, rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data).
This includes processing for statistical, management and business development purposes, for example seeking your thoughts and opinions on the services we provide to you and notifying you about any changes to our products and services. It may also include processing for marketing purposes, such as providing you with information related to any our products or services which we think may interest you (subject to your rights set out in section Your individual rights).
2.1.3
we may also process your personal data for other purposes but (unless this is in circumstances where the reason for doing so is compatible with the original purpose or we have other lawful grounds for doing so) this will usually only happen where we have obtained your specific consent. If that is the case, then you also have the right to withdraw your consent, which you can do by contacting us in writing at the address set out in section How to contact us.
2.1.4
Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.
2.2
Where we are acting as a data processor:
2.2.1
the business that has provided your personal information to us is itself responsible for ensuring that it has lawful grounds to do so and for providing us with instructions as to the specific types of personal data we are permitted to process; and
2.2.2
the ground(s) upon which that business is entitled to process your personal data is determined by them not us (and may vary from organisation to organisation); and
2.2.3
unless Data Protection Legislation requires or permits otherwise, we will process that personal data only in accordance with their instructions and for the purposes of enabling us to perform our obligations under our contract with them.
Your individual rights
Access to information
3.1
We want to make sure that you are fully aware of your data protection rights. These are set out in summary form in sections Withdrawal of consent - where our legal ground for processing your personal data is based upon you having given us your consent to do so, you have the right, at any time, to withdraw that consent (please see section
2.1.3
above). Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. - Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling - these rights don't apply to all circumstances but, where they do apply, they effectively provide you with safeguards against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is taken solely using or supported by automated means, without human intervention. below and apply to us in our role as a data controller.

3.2
Please note that, in order to comply with any request, we may first require you to verify your identity and we will normally fulfil any request by sending information electronically, unless the request expressly specifies a different method. We will not charge a fee for responding to your request, other than in circumstances where you make a request which is manifestly unfounded or excessive or you request further copies of information which we have already provided to you. In that case, we are entitled to charge a reasonable administrative fee.
3.3
Please also note that, where we are acting as a data processor, we will not be responsible for answering your request ourselves but will pass it onto the business organisation that provided us with your personal data (in their role as data controller) so that they may then determine how best to respond to it.
Timescales for responding
3.4
If you make a request of us (in our role as a data controller), we will normally have one month to respond to you. If we need something from you to be able to deal with your request (e.g. an ID document), the time limit will begin once we have received this. This time limit may also be extended in certain circumstances so, if there is any reason why our response to you might take longer than a month, we will let you know.
Summary of your rights

If that is the case, then you also have the right to withdraw your consent, which you can do by contacting us in writing at the address set out in section 8. above). Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

3.10.1
you are contesting the accuracy of the personal data (until the accuracy has been verified);
