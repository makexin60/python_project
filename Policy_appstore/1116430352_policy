Nightguard
This is an iPhone and Apple Watch application to display blood glucose values stored at your nightscout server.
Description
Disclaimer!
Don't use this App for medical decisions. It comes without absolutely no warranty. Use it at your own risk!
Nightguard is an app that displays your blood glucose values from the Nightscout backend.
It is a native iOS App with support for the Apple Watch.
Features are:
Define a range of acceptable blood glucose values.
Whenever your values are out of range you will be alerted.
You can snooze the alerts all the time and for a defined time period.
You can reactivate the alerts all the time.
You can activate alerts if the values are rising or falling too fast.
The app displays yesterdays values as an overlay chart. This way you have a hint about how your values could behave in the future.
Tune your basal rates with the statistics function to overlay different days
For the alarms to work the app has to be active. So you can enable a screen lock that keeps the app running all night long.
Have a look at
https://nightscout.github.io
for more information about how to setup your own Nightscout backend.
The dark gray region in the chart marks the values that are between 80 and 180.
This small video shows how to check the configuration and demonstrates the available Apple Watch Complication:

Developer Hints
First install cocoapods and do a
pod install
afterwards.
Then simply open the Nightguard folder "nightguard" in xcode.
If no scheme "nightguard" is existing, select "new Scheme" from the "Product|Scheme" Menu.
I had to modify the Eureka SliderRow. If you would like to compile the project of your own, you will have to modify
the SliderRow in the following way:
public final class SliderRow: Row<SliderCell>, RowType {

    public var steps: UInt = 20
    public var shouldHideValue = false
    public var lastSelectedValue : Float?

    required public init(tag: String?) {
        super.init(tag: tag)
    }
}
Now you should be able to launch the app in the simulator. Happy Coding!
Uploading the app
If you would like to run a local compiled version, you might wan't to disable the critical notification entitlement.
This can be done in File nightguard/scoutwatch.entitlements by changing the value to false:
<key>com.apple.developer.usernotifications.critical-alerts</key>
    <false/>

+
The owner does not provide a list of Personal Data types collected.
8
+
Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection.
9
+
Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically when using this Application.
10
+
Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases where this Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.
11
+
Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.
12
+
Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.
13
+
Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.

##
Mode and place of processing the Data
16
+
17
+
###
Methods of processing
18
+
The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.
19
+
The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
20
+
21
+
###
Legal basis of processing
22
+
The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
23
+
Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
24
+
provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
25
+
processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
26
+
processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
27
+
processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
28
+
In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
29
+
30
+
###
Place
31
+
The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.
32
+
33
+
Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
34
+
Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
35
+
36
+
If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
37
+
38
+
###
Retention time
39
+
Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.
40
+
Therefore:
41
+
Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
42
+
Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
43
+
The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
44
+
45
+
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
46
+
47

48
+

+
Withdraw their consent at any time. Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.

57
+
Lodge a complaint. Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.
58
+
59
+
##
Details about the right to object to processing
60
+
Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.
61
+
Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.

+
