Such processing will be in accordance with applicable laws.We may also process your Personal Information to perform various analyses and research, and to create dashboards and databases for business purposes, including to i) provide training insights to trainees, instructors and employers, ii) improve training delivery, iii) develop new products and solutions, iv) identify usage trends, v) enhance, improve or modify our services and vi) perform audits. When doing so, we rely on the legal basis mentioned in the above table. Otherwise, we ensure that data is anonymized or aggregated so that it is not possible to identify you.

Your consent is voluntary (meaning you choose whether to give it), and it can be withdrawn at any time.

When automated decision-making and profiling is used
When you submit an application for a job through our aviation placement services for our corporate clients, you will be screened as part of the application process using technology that compares your qualifications against the job requirements. Then, a decision as to whether you proceed in the recruitment process or are rejected is made automatically as a result of that comparison. This constitutes automated decision making, which means that a decision is made by technological means without any human intervention. If you are unsuccessful, you will be able to update your information on the "Placement for aviation professionals" section of our website and reapply to be re-evaluated.
