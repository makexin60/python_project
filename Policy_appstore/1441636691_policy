Our rules regarding data collection
We take your privacy seriously so we only collect information we need so that we can provide the best service possible.
If and when we collect customer information, we take care of the following:
We only collect personal information where we have a proper legal basis (e.g. ask for consent, have a legitimate reason to collect the information or the information is collected as part of performing a contract or to comply with legal requirements)We will only use the information we collect from you for the agreed purpose and for the period when it is needed.
We at least comply with the local data protection laws of the country where we provide a service through our website or our apps.
We keep information that is required by law in our register.
We explain why we need the information and how we want to use it (unless we have a legitimate reason not to do this).
We regularly check and update personal information (we may also want to cross-check the information in relation to another database to ensure that the information is accurate).
We will not share the information with anyone unless we have a legitimate and justified cause or we have permission from you or, if you are a child under 16, from your parents.
Personal Data and Builder's Journey
We do not hold or process your personal information as part of playing this game.  Nor do we collect any gameplay data via third party tools or our own tools for any purpose.
When you play our game, game play data is stored in your account storage to sync your game progress across devices. If you are signed in to our platform account , the account owner might receive your gameplay activity, including scores and achievements. We do not receive or store this data on our servers. You can delete your User Data stored in your account via the settings menu.
How this works with the gameplay in Builder's Journey is that the in-game achievements (the first being at the end of the tutorial) and in-game progress are stored to your account, tied to the player's ID. This is to allow your progress to move with you from one device to another where you use your platform specific account. We have done this so that when you complete level 10 on one device, you will start at level 11 on the next play session on whichever device you have signed into with your account. While we'd love for you to play the game as much as possible – we do not want you to be forced to start from the beginning each time!
We feel strongly about Child Safety and Data Privacy, and have taken this approach to really keep it simple for this specific type of building experience. Children are our role-models, and we have designed this game to be equally accessible to children.
There are parts of this game, Builder's Journey, where you are the builder, and you will build sand-castles and other items from LEGO® bricks as part of the story progression in the game. We have no access outside of the gameplay experience to store or retrieve these models, so we cannot see them, or infer any information about the builds.
We do not transfer, store or retain any of your build data on our own servers.
We do hope you have a lot of fun playing.
LEGO ID is not used in this experience
We do not use the LEGO ID in the Builder's Journey experience. We will not collect or store any information about your play experience, progression or LEGO builds at all that can be shared, automatically or by process of either LEGO staff or a third party. We will not be able to showcase your progress or builds within Builder's Journey within the experience to any other part of the LEGO online ecosystem.
If you have come to this notice to help work out how players are sharing their moments within the experience either to a LEGO service or another third party service – we can assure you this is not being done within the game experience, and is most likely individual players capturing screenshots and uploading them by themselves. We ask that when sharing any of your own experiences – be mindful of sharing any personal information publicly.
Changes to this Builder's Journey Privacy Notice
We may change this Privacy Notice to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. We will provide prior notice to players within both the Builder's Journey game as information and a consent prompt upon loading the experience, as well as update this material here.LEGO.com
