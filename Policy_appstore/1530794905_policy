The confidentiality of your data and respect for your privacy matters very much to us. At Salesoft, we make it a point of honor to ask you only for the information that allows us to operate our apps: nothing more, nothing less.
In this privacy policy, we explain what kind of data we collect, how and, above all, why we use this data.
The information we collect and how we use it
We would like to remind you again that we will only ask you for information that is essential for operating the app. By using our mobile apps, you are granting us the right to access and use this data.
Information that you provide to us for all of our apps:
Automatically collected data
When our apps are being used, we automatically collect information about your phone and app usage (language, country, model, operating system and events in the app). This information is completely anonymous and it does not identify you in any way. This information just allows us to get to know our usersâ€™ profiles better and for example, to identify problems that can occur on certain devices or in certain languages. We also track the amount of time you have spent playing the game and the number of tasks played, which allows us to improve our service and to know what you like most about our app, so we can always offer you the best service possible.
Optional information for support and promotional purposes
Do we share your information?
The answer is simple and it can be summed up in one word: No.
We do not share your data, other than in the ways stated in this privacy policy.
Changes to this privacy policy
This privacy policy is subject to change, if necessary. By accepting this privacy policy, you are also implicitly accepting any future changes. Please be aware that we will always remain committed to collecting and using only the data that is essential to the operation of our apps.
