2. Types of Information MOA Collects
We collect two basic types of information – Personal Information and Anonymous Information.  We may use personal information and anonymous information to create a third type of information – Aggregate Information.
Personal Information.
There are several places where MOA gives you an opportunity to provide  your Personal Information to MOA. MOA may ask you to provide Personal Information when you engage in certain activities on a Site or an App, such as: utilizing the MOA WiFi services; signing up for the Mall of America newsletter; participating in social media activities involving third-party providers such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, Swarm, or Yelp, whether at this Site or the social media websites; Chat; filling out a survey; sending feedback; downloading, installing or using an App; registering for sweepstakes or contests; or using a cell phone to send text messages to or call MOA.
If you choose to share any Personal Information with MOA, you will see that the amount and type of Personal Information MOA requests depends on how you use the corresponding Site. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, the information MOA asks you to provide will be identified as mandatory or voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
Biometric Information.
MOA collects biometric information from you when you physically enter Mall of America property for the sole purpose of detecting the presence of a person of interest (POI). POIs are individuals who are currently on a trespass at MOA, who may be a threat to the MOA environment, who were identified to MOA by law enforcement, or who are missing or may be in danger.
If you are a POI, photos of you are uploaded into the facial recognition system. The technology creates signatures by extracting facial measurement data—a mapping of an individual’s face. The technology monitors and works to match the faces on the video cameras with the signatures of the uploaded images. If a signature does not match an uploaded POI signature, the signature is not stored. If a signature is flagged as a potential match to a stored POI signature, the software system alerts the security team that a POI might be on property, which triggers further investigation by the security team.
MOA strictly limits access to your biometric information: it is only disclosed (if at all) when MOA provides access to its secure system to enable a vendor to perform maintenance.
MOA keeps this biometric information no longer than needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. For POIs, MOA will keep biometric
information (in the form of a POI signature) for the duration of the bar, threat, or status as missing or in danger. For guests who are not POIs, a signature is created while the system determines whether the guest may be a POI and then is permanently deleted once the analysis is complete. This analysis and deletion of signatures occurs in near real-time. For more information, please visit

.
Anonymous Information.
While you can generally browse a Site without informing MOA about who you are or revealing Personal Information about yourself, MOA does collect your computer’s and/or mobile device’s IP address, which is automatically disclosed when you visit a Site, as well as when you download or use an App so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to your computer or mobile device. MOA may use your IP address, together with other Personal Information that you may provide to us, such as your email address, to communicate with you directly about products and services that MOA believes may be of interest to you based on your activity on a Site. You have the ability to opt-out of receiving such promotional communications by updating your account settings or by following the unsubscribe instructions within any promotional communication you receive from MOA.
The Sites and/or Apps may utilize Cookies. For more information about how MOA uses Cookies please visit our
Cookie Policy
.
Aggregate Information.
We may use Google Analytics, third-party data analytics tools, and/or third party licensors to monitor: (i) traffic on our Sites or Apps, (ii) use of Mall of America’s WiFi service, and (iii) use of any Mall of America App and other software applications. MOA uses these analytic tools for MOA’s business purposes and to help us provide the kind of ‎user-friendly, up-to-date information that online users expect. Personal Information is not monitored or collected through this process and Aggregate Information does not include (directly or by inference) any information identifying you or any identifiable individual.
MOA uses these analytic tools and other various technical measures to gather and anonymize this data to prevent the information from being associated with any particular individual. These tracking tools are necessary to help us customize and continually improve our users’ experience, to gather demographic information about our customers and the visitors to our Sites, to offer our products and services, to monitor and track our marketing programs, and to serve targeted advertising on our Sites.
Participation in Activities.
When you engage in certain activities on a Site or an App, such as by registering or logging in as a user of an App or sending MOA a message using a Site or Chat, MOA may ask you to provide information including Personal Information. In order to engage in such activities, you will be required to provide information that allows MOA to know the specifics of who you are or where you are, and may include, without limitation, your name, email address, and whether you are a guest at one of our Locations. If you choose to share any Personal Information with MOA, you will see that the amount and type of Personal Information MOA requests depends on how you use a Site or an App.  It is optional for you to engage in these activities.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information MOA asks you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
Examples.
Examples of the type of information MOA may collect and store includes: first and last name; age and birthday; gender; mailing and email addresses including zip code; telephone number(s); device profile created and modified dates, shared device ‎preferences, lists of social networks associated with a user; Facebook ID, Google Plus ID, ‎Twitter Profile URL, LinkedIn Plus ID, Cookies, native device and application unique ‎identifiers (UIDs), custom identifiers, and application identifiers.‎
California Residents and Your Rights
If you are a California resident, you may have certain additional rights. Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from MOA, once per calendar year, information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2020 will receive information regarding 2019 sharing activities). To obtain this information from MOA, please email us at privacy@mallofamerica.com with “Shine the Light” in the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your e-mail address.  Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
In addition, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding the disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties by certain subsidiaries or affiliated  entities for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. MOA, through our Sites, Apps or other means may have collected information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California consumer or household (“Personal Information”).
In addition, the California Business and Professions Code, Section 22581, permits registered users who are minors to request and obtain deletion of certain posted content. To learn more about the Personal Information we may have collected and what your rights are under the CCPA and Section 22581 of the California Business and Professions Code, please review our
NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

At MOA, we are committed to being transparent with our customers regarding our privacy practices and compliance with the European Union (“EU”) privacy regulations known as the General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”), the Canadian privacy regulations known as PIPEDA, and other applicable data privacy regulations globally. In certain situations, MOA may transmit personal information collected on our Sites and through the use or purchase of goods or services to our affiliates or third-party service providers in other countries.  At all times such data transfers will be in furtherance of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. If Personal Information is transmitted from Europe to other countries, we will ensure that all Personal Information will be transferred with safeguards equivalent to those provided by the European data protection laws.

If you choose to use a mobile device with our Apps, WiFi or other services, your location information may be shared.

On occasion, MOA may aggregate this data with data ‎from other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns and provide this Aggregate Information to ‎vendors, business partners, or other parties to demonstrate the amount of interest in Sites and Apps, to help MOA plan for technical infrastructure requirements, and for other reasons. The Aggregate Information is anonymized and does not include (directly or by inference) any information identifying you or any identifiable individual.

8. Sharing Your Information with Other Companies
We will generally not share your Personal Information outside of MOA or MOA Affiliates except in limited circumstances, including:
MOA may share or otherwise disclose your Personal Information with third-parties service providers contracted by MOA or Affiliates to assist with internal MOA marketing efforts for MOA, Affiliates and/or MOA’s business partners. Please note that once we share your Personal Information with another company, the information received by the other company becomes subject to the other company’s privacy practices.
MOA may use and share Aggregate Information with vendors, potential advertisers, business partners, or other third parties.
MOA may disclose Personal Information in any of the following circumstances: (a) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other legal process or request, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law or regulation;  (b)  to  protect  and  defend  MOA’s rights or property or those of its Affiliates or business partners, or others; or (c) as MOA, in its sole discretion, believes is appropriate under exigent circumstances in response to a  perceived threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any person or organization.
Since MOA’s database is a business asset, in the event MOA is reorganized or becomes part of another organization, you consent to the sale, assignment, or transfer of your Personal Information to a successor that acquires substantially all of the business assets of MOA, or to an MOA Affiliate, as applicable.
MOA retains the right to share or sell Aggregate Information (information that is anonymized and does not include, directly or by inference, information identifying you or any identifiable individual) with third parties.
9. Other Sites
Our Sites or Apps may contain links to other websites. Additionally, other websites may contain links to our Sites. We do not review or monitor the websites linked to our Sites and are not responsible for the contents or privacy policies related to any other websites. If you visit one of these other websites, you should review the privacy policy on that website. Where a third party website or application contains a link to a Site owned and/or operated by us, the third party website may be subject to different and additional terms of service and privacy policy terms and conditions.
10. Your Controls and Choices
If you request to receive information from us, we presume that you have given us permission to communicate with you about that information, either by postal mail, e-mail, text message, social media, telephone or any other form of communication. Further, if you choose to use e-mail, text messaging or telephone for communications with MOA, such as a current condition or past experience, we will presume again that you have given us permission to communicate with you about your communication.
We provide you the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use and sharing of your information. Your controls and choices may include:
You may correct, update and delete your registration account;
You may change your choices for subscriptions, newsletters and alerts; and
You may unsubscribe from receiving offers and promotions for our products and services, or products and services that we think may be of interest to you.

Please be aware that, if you do not allow us to collect Personal Information from you, we may not be able to deliver certain products and services to you, and some of our services may not be able to take account of your interests and preferences. If you have questions regarding the specific Personal Information about you that we process or retain, please contact us at privacy@mallofamerica.com.
11. Data Security
The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  We have implemented what we believe to be reasonable precautions and safeguards to protect the security of data and information. For example, we may encrypt information using secure socket layer technology (SSL), whereby your information is converted into tiny bits of encrypted code that cannot be read by others during transmission. Our servers use this SSL technology to protect your information. However, MOA cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data or Personal Information, including credit card information that is provided to us. While MOA strives to protect your Personal Information, MOA cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from a Site or an App, by email or otherwise, and you provide such information at your own risk.
You acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations in computer systems and on the Internet which are beyond the control of MOA; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and MOA through Site or Apps, including Personal Information, cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with by a third party while such information or data is being used, transmitted, processed, or stored.
12. Changes to Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may change this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, without notice to you.  You expressly waive any right to receive notice of any changes to this Privacy Policy.  We will obtain your consent where required by applicable law. MOA encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly in your use of a Site or an App to ensure that you are aware of current practices. Any use of a Site or an App following the date on which MOA implements changes to this Privacy Policy shall constitute your acceptance of all such changes.
