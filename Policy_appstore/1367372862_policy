What Nitrolabs Collects
Nitrolabs collects and uses the following information to provide, improve, and protect the Services:
Account Information. We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as signing up for an account, or purchasing an upgraded account (like your name, email address, payment information and company name).
Your Content. Our Services are designed for you to upload, share, create, view, edit, annotate, and convert pdf documents (“Your Content”), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To do this, we store, process, and transmit Your Content as well as information related to it. The related information may include your profile name, the size of the file, the edits and annotations, as well as the time the file was uploaded and/or edited, and usage activity.
Cookies. When you visit the Site, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Nitrolabs also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web and on the Service. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some of the Services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
Log Information. When you access the Service via a web browser, application or by other means, our servers automatically record certain information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction with the Service, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
Your Communications. When you send emails or other communications to Nitrolabs, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our Services. When you receive push notifications from one of our Services that provides push notification functionality, we may collect and maintain information associated with those messages, such as the content of the message, whether it was interacted with, and the date and time of the transaction. We may also use your email address to communicate with you about the Service. We may record the delivery status of emails we send to you and whether they have been opened.
Contacts. You may choose to give Nitrolabs access to your contacts to make it easier for you to do things like collaborate on your Content, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do give Nitrolabs access to your contacts, we will store those contacts on our servers for you to use.
Nitrolabs collects and uses the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Service in a reliable and secure manner, and for legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we will ask for your consent in advance.
How Nitrolabs Stores Your Files and Personal Data
Nitrolabs is dedicated to file security. We use secure encryption techniques to make sure your files and personal data are always safe. We are fully transparent about the way we handle your files and personal data:
Except as set out in the section entitled "Information Nitrolabs Discloses", we will not wilfully give out or sell your files or personal data to anyone. Nor will we wilfully allow any third party to access your files or personal data.
We will not wilfully allow other users to access your files, except for the files that you share using the Service. We will not wilfully allow other users to access your personal data, except for the personal data you share to other users.
In the course of providing the Service, your files are transferred to and from Nitrolabs' servers. All Nitrolabs servers are located in the United States and all transfers are SSL encrypted. Nitrolabs takes the security of your files and personal data seriously – please see the "Nitrolabs Security Measures" Section below for further details.
We do not parse your files for keywords, or interact with your files in any way, other than to display your files in the Service.
When you delete your account, we remove all sensitive and personal data (including files) associated with that account within three (3) days of your request to delete your account is made. To ensure that your teams can continue working after you delete your account, we do not delete files that you have uploaded to a team.
Users can get access to all of their data stored by Nitrolabs by filing a subject access request. Please see the "Your Data Protection Rights" Section below for further information.
Users can request that all of your personal data, as stored by Nitrolabs, can be deleted, forgotten or removed by submitting a request with Nitrolabs as set forth in the "Your Data Protection Rights" Section below, or by logging into the Service and deleting your account.
We only retain a minimum amount of personal data to ensure Nitrolabs can provide a high-quality service. We do not retain copies of your files unless(i) you explicitly upload them to the Nitrolabs servers, (ii) you use the Service to perform a file conversation, or (iii) you use the sharing functionality in the Service to share your files.
Every file opened with the Service is given a unique id. We use that id to record annotations and edits you perform on the file within the Service.
Your signatures that you generate or create within the Service are encrypted when you upload and store them to the Nitrolabs servers and signatures are SSL encrypted when sent in transit.
Files stored by Google Drive or other Cloud Storage Providers
Storing your files with a cloud storage provider like Google Drive makes it easier and more secure to use the Service. Your files are even safer if you open files directly from your cloud storage provider:
Files that are opened from a cloud storage provider are not copied to our servers unless a file conversion is performed or you have shared the file.
All connections with cloud storage providers are encrypted.
Information Nitrolabs Discloses
Nitrolabs only shares personal information as discussed below, but we will never sell your personal information to advertisers or third parties:
We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our employees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
Permitted by Law. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of the Service and Nitrolabs, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
Merger. If Nitrolabs becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide you notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Other Users. Our Service displays your name, profile picture, email address, and usage information to other users you collaborate or share information with.
Team/Enterprise Accounts. If you are a user of a Team/Enterprise account user, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your account. Please refer to your organisation’s internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not a Team/Enterprise account user, but interact with a Team/Enterprise account user, members of that organization may be able to view the name, profile picture, email address, and usage information associated with your account at the time of that interaction, and the Team/Enterprise account administrator may have the ability to access and edit what you share.

Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
Nitrolabs Security Measures

This include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Nitrolabs employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals and third-party security firms are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
