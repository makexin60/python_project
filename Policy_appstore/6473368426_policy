3. Providing free wi-fi while you use our airports – under Irish law, all ‘Internet Service Providers’ or ISPs are obliged to maintain records of internet access for a period of 12 months. As we do not collect your name as part of the wi-fi sign-up, we store the IP address assigned to you and the MAC address of the device you used to access to wi-fi service. We keep these records as required by law.

4. Protecting the welfare of passengers, visitors and staff at Dublin Airport – we may need to record personal details relating to any individuals involved in incidents or accidents in the airport or its environs.

5. We may also perform statistical analysis on passenger and customer flows to improve our services and plan for future enhancements to our airport facilities – in this situation, we will anonymise your data before any analysis is performed so we cannot identify you.

To assist us in this, we operate CCTV security systems both landside and airside and our Airport Police manage these important security controls. CCTV images of you are considered to be personal data and we carefully safeguard access to these images. We retain all CCTV footage for 30 days.

6.2. Safety and Security – Queue Measurement – we are also obliged by statutory regulations in civil aviation to measure how long it takes to get you safely through the security screening process. We do this by monitoring passengers’ mobile devices while they move through the screening area. We only access the MAC address of your wi-fi or Bluetooth interface, and purge this data after six (6) years. You are free to switch off your wi-fi or Bluetooth as you go through security or the airport generally if you wish.

6.3. If you use the automatic border controls such as passport e-readers, you may be required to provide personal data. This system is controlled by Irish Naturalisation & Immigration Service (INIS) for the purpose of border control.

6.4. If purchasing goods from the retail outlets post US Preclearance, officially known as US Customs & Border Patrol (USCBP), your passport may be requested to verify your age and residency status.

Click here for additional information on US Customs & Border Patrol.

Where you provide your data directly to a third party, we have no involvement in that transaction or access to the data and the processing is the responsibility of the third party.
