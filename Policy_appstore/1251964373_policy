Privacy Policy - Police Motorbike Simulator 3D
Information We Collect
Non-personal Information
Police Motorbike Simulator 3D does not need or collect any personal information of our users which may identify them as an individual.
In-house Advertisements
In some apps and games we display internal advertisements in which we advertise our other games which we feel players will be interested in. No user specific or app specific information is stored or recorded.
Advertisement Caching
We cache images used for internal advertisements by storing them in the application root directory allowing us to re-display advertisements without needing to download them again keeping data usage to a minimum.
In-app Products
General
Some of our apps include paid items which can be purchased for additional content. These apps are labeled as containing in-app purchases on the storefront prior to purchase.
Paid items are clearly labeled as a paid item displaying price in your local currency prior to accepting and making the purchase.
Parents can also apply parental filters which require approval before these items can be purchased or simply block in-app purchasing completely.
Children
Our applications are intended for a general audience of all ages; however prior to app download our apps have an age rating assigned.
In some cases our apps may be enlisted into the store family program which means the app does not collect any personal information and has been certified by Google as safe for children.
The majority of our apps do not collect personal information but in cases where we do, we ask the user to agree to our terms of service and agree that they're at least 13 years of age or ask that a parent consents for them. We do not knowingly collect or track personal information from users under 13 years old without prior parental consent. If informed of any personal information collected from users below this age without consent then we will delete the information and stop any further collection from the individual (account removal).
If you are a parent or guardian and are worried that we may have collected any personal information about your child unknowingly please
submit a data removal request here
and we will delete any information from our system.
