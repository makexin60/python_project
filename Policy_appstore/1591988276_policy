Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (“
Compliance with Law
”).

We set out below the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant purposes for which we use your personal information.
For Service Delivery
Categories of personal information
: Contact data, Demographic Information, Communications, User-generated content
Legal Basis
: Contractual Necessity – Processing is necessary to perform the contract governing our provision of our services or to take steps that you request prior to signing up for the services.

For Research and Development
Categories of personal information
: Contact data, Demographic Information, Communications, User-generated content

: Compliance with Law – Processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
Use for new purposes
. We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it.  If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.
No sensitive personal information.
We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Services, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Services, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Services.
No obligation to provide personal information.
You do not have to provide personal information to us. However where we
need
to process your personal information either to comply with applicable law or to deliver our Services to you, and you fail to provide that personal information when requested, we may not be able to provide some or all of our Services to you. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.
No automated decision-making and profiling.
As part of the Services, we do not engage in automated decision-making and/or profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects. We will let you know if that changes by updating this Privacy Policy.
Security
. We have put in place procedures designed to deal with breaches of personal information. In the event of such breaches, we have procedures in place to work with applicable regulators. In addition, in certain circumstances (including where we are legally required to do so), we may notify you of breaches affecting your personal information.
Your rights
. The UK data protection legislation gives you certain rights regarding your personal information.  If you are located in the UK, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:
Right of access
: You can ask us to provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.
Right to rectification
: If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to request to have it rectified.
Right to erasure
: You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information where there is no lawful reason for us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law.
Right to restrict processing
: You can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information if: (i) you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Right to object
: Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Right to data portability
: You have the right, in certain circumstances, to ask us to provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Right to withdraw consent at any time
: Where we are relying on consent to process your personal information you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
Please note that some of these rights may be limited where we have an overriding interest or legal obligation to continue to process the personal information or where certain exemptions apply. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided above. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request.
Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights; however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within a month of receipt. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests; in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Although we urge you to contact us first to find a solution for every concern you may have, you always have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. You can find information about how to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office here:
https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint
.
Cross-border data transfer
. We are headquartered in the United States and may use service providers that operate in the United States or other countries. Therefore, we may transfer your personal information to recipients outside the UK. Some of these recipients are located in countries in respect of which the UK Government has issued adequacy decisions, in which case, the recipient’s country is recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under UK data protection legislation and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Some recipients of your personal information may be located in countries outside the UK for which the UK Government has not issued adequacy decisions in respect of the level of data protection in such countries (“Restricted Country”). For example, at the time of publication of this Privacy Policy, the United States is a Restricted Country. When we transfer your personal information to a recipient in a Restricted Country, we will either:
enter into appropriate data transfer agreements based on the appropriate data transfer mechanism as approved from time-to-time by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or UK Government, such as the so-called International Data Transfer Agreement; or
rely on other appropriate means permitted by the UK data protection legislation, which establish that such recipients will provide an adequate level of data protection and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
You may ask for a copy of such appropriate specific data transfer mechanism by contacting us using the contact detail above.

Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third-party cookies, which are served by service providers and our third party advertising partners, or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Third-party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising, and social media features.
What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies do we use on the Sites and App?
We use cookies and other tracking technologies in the following categories described in the table below.

These cookies are necessary to allow the technical operation of our services (e.g., they enable you to move around on a website and to use its features).
Google Tag Manager
See ‘your choices’ below.
Functionality / performance
These cookies help us collect information about the traffic to our services and enhance the performance and functionality of our services. The information gathered via these cookies does not directly identify any individual visitor.; however, it may render such visitors ‘indirectly identifiable’.
We use a number of different first party and third-party cookies to achieve this purpose.
See ‘your choices’ below.
Other technologies
In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology to pixel tags to collect information automatically.

We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (“LSOs”), for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.
Web Beacons
We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.
Mobile Application Software Development Kits (SDKs)
We may use third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) in our mobile applications. An SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, or to facilitate online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our App.

If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Services.
No obligation to provide personal information.
You do not have to provide personal information to us. However where we
need
to process your personal information either to comply with applicable law or to deliver our Services to you, and you fail to provide that personal information when requested, we may not be able to provide some or all of our Services to you. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.
No automated decision-making and profiling.
As part of the Services, we do not engage in automated decision-making and/or profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects. We will let you know if that changes by updating this Privacy Policy.
Security
. We have put in place procedures designed to deal with breaches of personal information. In the event of such breaches, we have procedures in place to work with applicable regulators. In addition, in certain circumstances (including where we are legally required to do so), we may notify you of breaches affecting your personal information.
Your rights
. The UK data protection legislation gives you certain rights regarding your personal information.  If you are located in the UK, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:
Right of access
: You can ask us to provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.
Right to rectification
: If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to request to have it rectified.
Right to erasure
: You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information where there is no lawful reason for us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law.
Right to restrict processing
: You can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information if: (i) you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Right to object
: Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Right to data portability
: You have the right, in certain circumstances, to ask us to provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Right to withdraw consent at any time
: Where we are relying on consent to process your personal information you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
Please note that some of these rights may be limited where we have an overriding interest or legal obligation to continue to process the personal information or where certain exemptions apply. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided above. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request.
Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights; however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within a month of receipt. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests; in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Although we urge you to contact us first to find a solution for every concern you may have, you always have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. You can find information about how to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office here:

.
Cross-border data transfer
. We are headquartered in the United States and may use service providers that operate in the United States or other countries. Therefore, we may transfer your personal information to recipients outside the UK. Some of these recipients are located in countries in respect of which the UK Government has issued adequacy decisions, in which case, the recipient’s country is recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under UK data protection legislation and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Some recipients of your personal information may be located in countries outside the UK for which the UK Government has not issued adequacy decisions in respect of the level of data protection in such countries (“Restricted Country”). For example, at the time of publication of this Privacy Policy, the United States is a Restricted Country. When we transfer your personal information to a recipient in a Restricted Country, we will either:
enter into appropriate data transfer agreements based on the appropriate data transfer mechanism as approved from time-to-time by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or UK Government, such as the so-called International Data Transfer Agreement; or
rely on other appropriate means permitted by the UK data protection legislation, which establish that such recipients will provide an adequate level of data protection and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
You may ask for a copy of such appropriate specific data transfer mechanism by contacting us using the contact detail above.

What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience.
Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third-party cookies, which are served by service providers and our third party advertising partners, or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Third-party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising, and social media features.
What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies do we use on the Sites and App?

Functionality / performance
These cookies help us collect information about the traffic to our services and enhance the performance and functionality of our services. The information gathered via these cookies does not directly identify any individual visitor.; however, it may render such visitors ‘indirectly identifiable’.

Web Beacons
We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.

We may use third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) in our mobile applications. An SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, or to facilitate online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our App.
