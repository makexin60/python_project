Introduction
Lugg, Inc. and its subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates (collectively,

developed this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) so that you can make educated and
informed decisions about the personal information that you entrust to us by
engaging our services on the websites, social media, email exchanges, mobile
apps, and other online services on which this Policy is posted or linked (the
“Service”), and understand how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise manage
this information.

our Terms of Service. Before using our Service, please read this Policy
carefully as it contains important information on who we are and how and why we

visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the
Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for
competitions and promotions (“User Content”). You are strictly prohibited from
providing any information, in the form of User Content, or through any other
avenues, about anyone under the age of 18, and under no circumstances may you

any such unrequested sensitive information, we will delete it.

We may combine this with data that we already have collected about you. Such

development, performance, and conduct; protecting the company against illegal
activity and other misconduct; undertaking activities to verify and maintain the
quality, safety, and performance of our products and services; and complying
with our legal obligations.

collected, Lugg shall, prior to such processing, provide you with any relevant
information on such additional purpose, and, to the extent required by
