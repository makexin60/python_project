Further, we do not knowingly accept, request, or solicit information from children or knowingly market to children. Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, if we receive actual knowledge that anyone under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from Sporty's Sites as quickly as is reasonably practical.
Otherwise, by using Sporty's Sites, you affirm that you are both age 18 or older and that you are able and legally competent to do so.
These Terms (“Terms of Use” or “Terms”) set forth the entire Agreement between you and us with respect to use of Sporty's Sites and the subject matter hereof.  They constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and Sportsman's Market, Inc. ("Sporty's," “we,” “us” or “our”) concerning your access to and use of this website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected hereto, including other Internet sites on which these Terms are posted (collectively “Sporty's Sites”). The Terms supersede any prior agreements between you and Sporty's relating to such subject matter. The Terms are not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with Sporty's prior written consent. In the event that any provision hereof is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, the balance shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable.
No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, franchise, or franchiser/franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms of Use or the use of Sporty's Sites. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them.
Any heading, caption, or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. Sporty's performance of these Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms of Use is in derogation of Sporty's right to comply with any governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of Sporty's Sites or information provided to or gathered by Sporty's with respect to such use. A printed version of these Terms of Use, and of any notices given in electronic form, will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Use ─ to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The parties agree that all correspondence relating to these Terms of Use must be written in the English language.
It is Sporty’s intention to provide excellent service to all of its customers, including those with disabilities. We have invested in a significant number of resources to help ensure Sporty’s Sites are made easier to use and accessible for people with disabilities.

You agree that by accessing Sporty's Sites, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms. If you do not agree with all of these Terms, then you are expressly prohibited from using Sporty's Sites and you must discontinue use immediately.
Supplemental Terms or documents that may be posted on Sporty's Sites from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms at any time and for any reason.
We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change.
It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms to stay informed of updates.

Accordingly, those persons who choose to access Sporty's Sites from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

Sporty's Pilot Training Online is a web application allowing users to access content from Sporty's collection of aviation training courses.

Legal Disputes
Any dispute between you and Sporty's, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, "Sporty's") arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Sporty's will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Sporty's and you must provide such notice by e-mail to
legaldepartment@sportys.com
.
During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle any Covered Disputes amicably by mutual discussions. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or videoconference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Sporty's and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Sporty's, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Sporty's and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Sporty's nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action, and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to conflict of laws principles. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Clermont County, Ohio, USA in any and all claims or disputes to enforce, construe, or otherwise relating to these Terms of Use or the use of Sporty's Sites.
YOU AND SPORTY'S AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms.
GOVERNING LAW
These Terms and your use of Sporty's Sites are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within Ohio without regard to its conflict of law principles. Sporty's liability shall be limited to the full extent permitted by law.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

Both the app and online platforms are free to use and provide access to limited content from each course, which can be accessed by using the "Preview" function.

When you place an order using Sporty's Sites you will need to provide address and other information to identify you including your email address and a telephone number. Sporty's will use your telephone number to contact you when there are questions about your orders. It will not be used for voice solicitations.
Without prior notification Sporty's reserves the right to limit the order quantity on any item and to refuse services to any customer. Verification of information may also be required prior to acceptance of an order. If there is a question about your order, we will try to contact you.
Prices and availability on Sporty's Sites are subject to change without notice. We are not responsible for pricing, typographical or other errors in any offer, and reserve the right to cancel any orders resulting from such errors.

Sporty's reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or to cancel any order for any reason. Sporty's does not charge a credit or debit card until an order ships except, if PayPal, a direct account deduction, or credit service is used, charges will be made at the time the order is placed.
At the time you place an order you are certifying that you are 18 years of age or older.

Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL SPORTY'S OR ITS OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS, AFFILIATES OR THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON OR TO SPORTY'S SITES OR VIA OTHER CHANNELS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHONE AND EMAIL, BE LIABLE TO ANY USER OF SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN, INCLUDING USER CONTENT, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SPORTY'S HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.
You hereby acknowledge that the preceding limitation on liability will apply to all content, merchandise and services available through Sporty's Sites or other channels. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if Sporty's is found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the amount in dispute not to exceed the total amount which you paid to us in the twelve (12) months prior to the action giving rise to the liability or (b) USD $100.
Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Sporty's harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party if the claim or demand is due to or arise out of your violation of these Terms of Use.
Legal Disputes
Any dispute between you and Sporty's, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, "Sporty's") arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Sporty's will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Sporty's and you must provide such notice by e-mail to legaldepartment@sportys.com.
During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or videoconference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Sporty's and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Sporty's, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Sporty's and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Sporty's nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action, and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or conditions so such disclaimers may not apply to you.
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL SPORTY'S OR ITS OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS, AFFILIATES OR THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON OR TO SPORTY'S SITES OR VIA OTHER CHANNELS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHONE AND EMAIL, BE LIABLE TO ANY USER OF SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN, INCLUDING USER CONTENT, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SPORTY'S HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.
You hereby acknowledge that the preceding limitation on liability will apply to all content, merchandise and services available through Sporty's Sites or other channels. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if Sporty's is found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the amount in dispute not to exceed the total amount which you paid to us in the twelve (12) months prior to the action giving rise to the liability or (b) USD $100.
Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Sporty's harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party if the claim or demand is due to or arise out of your violation of these Terms of Use.
Legal Disputes
Any dispute between you and Sporty's, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, "Sporty's") arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Sporty's will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Sporty's and you must provide such notice by e-mail to legaldepartment@sportys.com.
During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or videoconference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Sporty's and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Sporty's, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Sporty's and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Sporty's nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action, and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to conflict of laws principles.  You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Clermont County, Ohio, USA in any and all claims or disputes to enforce, construe, or otherwise relating to these Terms of Use or the use of Sporty's Sites.
YOU AND SPORTY'S AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or conditions so such disclaimers may not apply to you.
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL SPORTY'S OR ITS OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS, AFFILIATES OR THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON OR TO SPORTY'S SITES OR VIA OTHER CHANNELS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHONE AND EMAIL, BE LIABLE TO ANY USER OF SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN, INCLUDING USER CONTENT, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SPORTY'S HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.
You hereby acknowledge that the preceding limitation on liability will apply to all content, merchandise and services available through Sporty's Sites or other channels. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if Sporty's is found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the amount in dispute not to exceed the total amount which you paid to us in the twelve (12) months prior to the action giving rise to the liability or (b) USD $100.
Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Sporty's harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party if the claim or demand is due to or arise out of your violation of these Terms of Use.
Legal Disputes
Any dispute between you and Sporty's, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, "Sporty's") arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Sporty's will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Sporty's and you must provide such notice by e-mail to
legaldepartment@sportys.com
.
During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or videoconference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Sporty's and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Sporty's, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Sporty's and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Sporty's nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action, and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to conflict of laws principles.  You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Clermont County, Ohio, USA in any and all claims or disputes to enforce, construe, or otherwise relating to these Terms of Use or the use of Sporty's Sites.
YOU AND SPORTY'S AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

Sporty's intends for the information and data contained on Sporty's Sites to be accurate and reliable. You expressly agree that your use of Sporty's Sites and any information contained therein is at your sole risk.
SPORTY'S DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SPORTY'S SITES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, FREE FROM VIRUSES OR SECURITY BREACHES; NOR DOES SPORTY'S MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF SPORTY'S SITES.  SPORTY'S SITES' CONTENT IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ACCURATE, TIMELY OR VERIFIED.  SPORTY'S SITES AND SPORTY'S SITES' CONTENT ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS AND SPORTY'S EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE WITH RESPECT TO SPORTY'S SITES, OR ANY OF THEIR CONTENT.  YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SPORTY'S SITES AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT OR DATA MADE AVAILABLE VIA SPORTY'S SITES IS ASSUMED SOLELY BY YOU.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or conditions so such disclaimers may not apply to you.
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL SPORTY'S OR ITS OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS, AFFILIATES OR THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON OR TO SPORTY'S SITES OR VIA OTHER CHANNELS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHONE AND EMAIL, BE LIABLE TO ANY USER OF SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SPORTY'S SITES OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN, INCLUDING USER CONTENT, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SPORTY'S HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.
You hereby acknowledge that the preceding limitation on liability will apply to all content, merchandise and services available through Sporty's Sites or other channels. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if Sporty's is found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the amount in dispute not to exceed the total amount which you paid to us in the twelve (12) months prior to the action giving rise to the liability or (b) USD $100.
Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Sporty's harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party if the claim or demand is due to or arise out of your violation of these Terms of Use.
Legal Disputes
Any dispute between you and Sporty's, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, "Sporty's") arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Sporty's will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Sporty's and you must provide such notice by e-mail to
legaldepartment@sportys.com
.
During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or videoconference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Sporty's and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Sporty's, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Sporty's and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Sporty's nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action, and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to conflict of laws principles.  You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Clermont County, Ohio, USA in any and all claims or disputes to enforce, construe, or otherwise relating to these Terms of Use or the use of Sporty's Sites.
YOU AND SPORTY'S AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

For over fifty years our philosophy has been to earn and keep our customers’ trust and to provide the best service and customer satisfaction in the retail industry. Because of this philosophy, we treat the information you provide us in confidence. Sporty’s consistently works to improve Sporty’s security measures. However, no security system is foolproof and Sporty’s cannot guarantee the security of the user’s information.
When you visit Sporty's Sites, our web server will recognize your Internet service provider. This collection of visitor information allows us to make our site work better for you. Your name and address are stored on our web server so it is available when you log in to your account with your user name and password.
We use COOKIES, which are small files placed on your computer's hard drive. By continuing to use Sporty's Sites you agree for these files to be added.

Enabling the functionality of some specific services like payment which will not work without those cookies.
Enabling a service to recognize your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task.
Collecting information about abandoned shopping carts. A cart is considered abandoned within one hour of inactivity/lack of purchase. Once the cart is considered abandoned, an SMS message may be sent as a reminder.
Recognizing that you may already have given a username and password when logged in to Sporty's Sites so you don't need to do it for every web page requested.
Measuring how many people are using our sites, so they can be made easier to use and ensuring sufficient capacity is available.
Analyzing data to help us understand how you use online services so we can improve them.
In addition to cookies, we may also use device identifiers, web storage, and other technologies to collect information about your interactions with our content and services.
These technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most. Cookies and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information and purchases and interactions (both online and offline) with personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We and third-party advertising partners may use cookies, pixels and similar technologies to collect information about the websites you visit and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). We and our partners may use this information for our, and our partners’, business purposes, including to send online and offline communications about products and services that may be of interest to you. We or our partners may use the information we collected about your browser or device to associate it with a physical mailing address so that we can mail you advertisements and/or content we think you may be interested in and for other business purposes. For example, we may use this information to: deliver products and services to you; improve our business; transact business; and market our products and services through a variety of media like email, online advertising, and direct mail.

We send customers periodic catalog mailings and send emails announcing items we believe may be of interest to them. We also make our mailing list (name and address only, not our email list or telephone numbers) available to a few reputable, carefully screened companies whose products you may find of interest. You may opt-out of catalog mailings and/or our transfer of mailing lists to other companies.  You may also access the information we have about you and make corrections or deletions it if it is inaccurate.

Sporty’s Privacy Policy:
Last Revised 07-18-2023
For over fifty years our philosophy has been to earn and keep our customers’ trust and to provide the best service and customer satisfaction in the retail industry. Because of this philosophy, we treat the information you provide us in confidence. Sporty’s consistently works to improve Sporty’s security measures. However, no security system is foolproof and Sporty’s cannot guarantee the security of the user’s information.
When you visit Sporty's Sites, our web server will recognize your Internet service provider. This collection of visitor information allows us to make our site work better for you. Your name and address are stored on our web server so it is available when you log in to your account with your user name and password.
When ordering or requesting a catalog, customers provide Sporty’s with certain information such as name, physical and email address, telephone number, credit card number, etc. This information is necessary to process an order. A customer’s telephone number is used when we have a question about the order. It may also be used by a delivery service if there is a question about delivery. For its own use and for your future transactions Sporty’s retains information about its customers.
We send customers periodic catalog mailings and send emails announcing items we believe may be of interest to them. We also make our mailing list (name and address only, not our email list or telephone numbers) available to a few reputable, carefully screened companies whose products you may find of interest. You may opt-out of catalog mailings and/or our transfer of mailing lists to other companies.  You may also access the information we have about you and make corrections or deletions it if it is inaccurate. We also receive mailing list information from other companies. We may also share personal information with third party marketing partners for commercial purposes.
