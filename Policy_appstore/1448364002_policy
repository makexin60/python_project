IMPORTANT PRIVACY INFORMATION
To use some of our Services (apps, websites, and others), we may ask you to provide specific information such as your name (or nickname), email address, date of birth, information about your feelings and mental well-being, and other onboarding details. Depending on the app or web product you choose within our ecosystem, additional data—such as your pulse, heart rate, a photo of your hand, or other information—may be required (please refer to
Section 2.1
of this Policy). In some of the cases, you have the option to skip certain onboarding questions by selecting "Skip" or a similar feature.

feature, which collects data about your interactions with subscription content. Certain event data (Customer Account Age, User Account Details, Content Consumption Level, Platform Information, Total In-App Purchase Amount, App Usage Time, and Account Status)
may also be shared with Apple to enhance subscription management in line with Apple’s guidelines. Apple uses and protects this data per its Privacy Policy, retaining it only as necessary to fulfill its purpose, such as improving the refund process by reviewing refund requests more effectively. For further details on how Apple protects data, see the
Apple Platform Security Guide
or the
App Store & Privacy
documentation. Apple may share this data with service providers acting on its behalf, partners, or others at your direction but will not use it for marketing purposes. You may opt out of transferring this event data to Apple by contacting us.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy to better understand how we handle your data (

AI Feature
In our app, we feature a Personal AI-Therapist-assisted chatbot powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. Consequently, if you choose to engage in a conversation with the AI Therapist, your conversations will be transmitted to OpenAI's servers via an API connection. However, we will not transfer any data from your conversations that would enable OpenAI to identify you unless you explicitly provide such information within your conversations. We do share your nickname with OpenAI to ensure proper addressing by the AI Therapist, which is essential for delivering the user experience we aim to provide. It's important to note that we do not permit OpenAI to utilize your information for training or enhancing its models.
Please be aware that some of the information you may disclose during your conversations could be sensitive. We kindly request that you refrain from providing such sensitive information, and we assure you that we will not process such data unless we obtain your explicit consent. When we do process such information, it will solely be for the purpose of delivering our service to you.
The data transfer between our platform and OpenAI occurs through a SOC 2 Type 2 compliant API connection, which has been independently audited by a third-party auditor in accordance with the 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security. You can find more information about this audit from publicly available sources on OpenAI's website (https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).
OpenAI will retain the information you send via the API for a maximum of thirty (30) days, after which it will be deleted, except when OpenAI is required to retain copies under applicable laws. In such cases, OpenAI will isolate and protect that information from any further processing except as mandated by applicable laws.
For additional details regarding OpenAI's API data usage policies, please consult https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies
SUBSCRIPTION TERMS
1.1.
The App is provided on a free basis, granting users access to its basic features upon download. However, premium features, content, or services are available through a subscription model, typically on a recurring weekly basis. Subscribers may receive benefits such as exclusive content and advanced features. Detailed subscription terms are accessible on the purchase screen prior to completing the transaction.
1.2.
A free trial period of three days may be offered, allowing users to experience premium features. If not canceled at least 24 hours before the trial period ends, users will be automatically charged the specified price for the chosen subscription plan, as indicated on the payment screen.
1.3.
In-app purchases are facilitated through the App. Payment will be charged to the specified payment method at the time of purchase confirmation or after the trial period expires. It is important to note that we do not collect payment data; all financial transactions are processed by our authorized agents, Google Play and Apple Store.
1.4.
Prices and taxes may be subject to occasional changes, transitioning to a subscription model, which includes recurring subscription fees. We will communicate any changes in prices to you in advance. These changes will take effect at the beginning of the next subscription period following the date of the price adjustment. By continuing to use the subscription after the price change takes effect, you will be deemed to have accepted the new pricing. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject it by unsubscribing from the applicable subscription before the new price becomes effective.
Tax rates and other fees are determined based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts may change over time due to local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in the tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.
1.5. CANCELLATION:
Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each period unless canceled. Deleting the app does not cancel subscriptions. Users can cancel subscriptions via their Google Play and App Store accounts or through the "Cancel Subscription" button in the app settings, which redirects to the subscriptions section in Google Play/App Store. After cancellation, access to subscription features continues until the end of the current period.
For subscriptions purchased on the App Store:
you can easily cancel a free trial or subscription by disabling auto-renewal in your Apple account settings. To manage subscriptions independently, refer to Apple's support page for detailed guidance. If you wish to cancel your subscription directly on your iOS device, follow these steps:
1 - Open the standard iOS Settings app.
2 - At the top, tap your name.
3 - Navigate to "Subscriptions."
4 - Tap the subscription that you want to manage.
5 - If you wish to cancel, tap "Cancel Subscription."
6 - If you don’t see the option to cancel, it means the subscription is already canceled and won't renew.
For subscriptions purchased on Google Play,
you can easily cancel a free trial or subscription by disabling auto-renewal in your Google Play account settings. To manage subscriptions independently, refer to Google's support page for detailed guidance. If you wish to cancel your subscription directly on your Android device, follow these steps:
1 - Open the Google Play Store app on your Android phone or tablet.
2 - At the top right, tap the profile icon.
3 - Navigate to "Payments & subscriptions" and then click on "Subscriptions."
4 - Choose the specific subscription you wish to cancel.

support resources
for further assistance. We appreciate your understanding and are here to help if you have any questions or concerns.
1.6. REFUND:
Generally, if you do not meet the conditions of the Refund Policies set out above, the fees you have paid are non-refundable and/or non-exchangeable unless otherwise stated herein or as required by applicable law. In addition, our company may consider certain refund requests on a case-by-case basis and grant them at our sole discretion.
Subscription and payment management is beyond our control as Google/Apple doesn't provide access to billing information. Refund decisions are made by Google/Apple. To request a refund, use the order number found in the confirmation email received upon subscription.
To request a refund, follow these instructions from the
Apple support page
,
Google's support page.

The length of time your account has been active.
User Account Details:
Data related to the account that completed the purchase.

If the User made a subscription purchase but it wasn’t delivered or isn’t working correctly, the services are defective, unavailable, or don’t perform as stated and it’s been more than 48 hours since User made the purchase, we consider a refund request.
Please note that after your subscription period expires, we will not be able to refund you as the service will be deemed consumed in full unless otherwise provided for by applicable law.
Note for the EU residents.
Under the law, you have an automatic statutory right of withdrawal from contracts for purchases of digital content, such as apps, games, in-app items, or other media like movies or music. The same applies when you purchase a subscription for digital content within an app. However, when you purchase or subscribe to digital content with Google Play and Apple Store, you agree that the digital content will be available to you immediately, and you acknowledge that, as a result, you waive your automatic statutory right of withdrawal. Therefore, you will not be eligible for a refund (or any alternative remedy) unless the digital content is defective, unavailable, or doesn’t perform as stated.
Note for residents of certain US states.
If you reside in California or Connecticut and cancel the purchase at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of such purchase, we will return the payment you have made.

We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information with nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing uses as contemplated by California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code § 1798.83), unless we have your permission.
We do share personal information with the Processors of the Personal Data of the Services of APPSELLA LTD mentioned in paragraph 4.
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below:
You can request information about how we have collected and used your personal information during the past
12 months, including the categories of personal information collected, the sources from which we collected personal information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting personal information, and the third parties with whom we shared personal information.
You can request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months. Also, according to California's “Shine the Light” law, users who are California residents have the right to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties. To make such a request from us, if entitled, please use the contact information listed below.
You can ask us to delete the personal information we have collected from you. We may need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete some or all of your information, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.
You have the right to be Free from Discrimination. We may not discriminate against you because you have exercised your rights, including, for example, by denying you access to our online services or charging you different rates or prices for the same online services, unless that difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your data.
You have
the right to opt out of the sale of Personal Information, which is defined in a way that may include the transfer of data to third parties to personalize ads for you. Please note that the CCPA defines the term “sale” very broadly to include any exchange of data for consideration of any kind, not simply selling your data for monetary compensation. Depending upon the circumstances, the term “sale” could include a company providing a resident’s data to another entity to assist the company with targeted advertising. We do not sell to third parties, and within the last 12 months have not sold, any of your personal information. If you opt out of the ‘sale’ of your information, we will not sell your information, including to our advertising partners, but you may continue to receive ads from our Services, which may not be as tailored to your interests.
You may exercise your California privacy rights described above by emailing us. We will need to confirm your identity (e.g. first name, last name, account name, email address, state of residence, etc.) and California residency to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights. We aim to respond to a consumer request for access or deletion within 45 days of receiving that request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
