1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to commercial insurance.
If you have a telematics policy, we’d also like to tell you some additional information that applies to your policy so please ask your broker for further details regarding how we use your Personal Information.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your relationship with us will determine which of our group companies are the data controller(s) responsible for your Personal Information. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Probitas).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of separate relationships with us you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Where we provide commercial insurance, the Personal Information that we collect may relate to the individual (or individuals where it’s taken out jointly) who is taking out a policy (e.g. a director taking out insurance on behalf of a company) or individuals who will be covered by the policy (e.g. a solicitor or accountant under a professional negligence policy, an employee under an employers’ liability policy or a driver under a fleet motor policy). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example, if you ask us to provide insurance for a group of employees under a fleet policy, or if you make a claim for business interruption as a result of an injury sustained by an essential employee.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

Lawful Bases for uses of Personal Information
We are committed to collecting and using Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws. By law, we must have a legal justification, known as a lawful basis, in order to use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Depending upon the purpose, our lawful basis will be one of the following:
Performance of a contract – to arrange, underwrite or manage our products, or handle claims in accordance with their terms where we provide an insurance policy directly to you;
Compliance with a legal obligation – to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or other legal responsibilities;
Legitimate interests – to arrange, underwrite or manage our products, or handle claims in accordance with their terms where we provide an insurance policy to a third party, to operate and improve our products and services and keep people informed about our products and services or for any other purposes we identify as appropriate to our business needs, or those business needs of a third party;
Consent – where we have obtained appropriate consent to collect or use your Personal Information for a particular purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual. The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether we can use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests, the interests being relied upon will usually be:
To arrange, underwrite or manage our products, or handle claims in accordance with their terms where we provide an insurance policy to a third party;
To provide cover under a group policy where your employer is the policyholder;
To further our business and commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party, e.g., to produce management information on our performance and the performance of third parties;
To help us better understand our customers and improve our customer engagement including by carrying out marketing analytics and profiling, e.g. by making certain predictions and assumptions about your interests;
To provide you with helpful information relating to your products and about useful tools for managing and engaging with your products. These are not marketing communications;
To send you marketing information in accordance with your preferences, e.g. about other products and services we offer, and to administer promotions that you enter;
To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, guidelines, standards and codes of conduct, e.g., background checks or the prevention, detection and investigation of financial crime or fraud;
To improve and develop our business, products and services, or those of a third party, e.g. to ensure the accuracy of customer data and to develop our pricing and risk methods and models;
To retain your policy record for a period of time in order to ensure we have appropriate records in place in respect of any future claims that may be insured by us;
To safeguard our business, shareholders, employees and customers, or those of a third party, e.g., maintaining the security of our IT network and information, enforcing claims, including debt collection;
To facilitate the purchase, sale, transfer or disposal of any part of our business; and
To analyse and assess competition in the market for our products services, e.g., by carrying out market research.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime, including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess if your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information. For example, we may use your past motoring convictions for motoring insurance. See the section of
Automated Decision Making
for further details.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes National Sira administered by Synectics Solutions Limited (as joint data controller together with contributing companies, including Aviva),
Experian whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
and the
Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA, ELTO, MIB and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing our products and related services and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If we receive false or inaccurate information on your behalf and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared between insurers.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
Please note that if you provide false or inaccurate information it may invalidate the relevant insurance policy/prospective insurance policy or it could affect the amount we pay to settle any claims made under the policy.
For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA
please visit their website
.
How your Personal Information is used and shared by insurers and databases in relation to motor insurance
The Personal Information you provide will be used by us and shared with other insurers as well as certain statutory and other authorised bodies for:
Insurance underwriting purposes, i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
Consider whether to accept the relevant risk;
Make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance and related services for you (and members of your household);
Validate your (or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim) claims history (at any time including upon application for insurance, in the event of an accident or a claim, or mid-term adjustment, or at a time of renewal).
Management Information purposes. To analyse insurance and other markets for the purposes of:
Portfolio assessment;
Risk assessment;
Performance reporting;
Management reporting;
Anti-fraud purposes.
To detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by:
Sharing information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
Tracing debtors or beneficiaries, recovering debt, managing your accounts and/or insurance policies;
Undertaking fraud searches. Insurers pass information to fraud prevention agencies and databases including the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register and where appropriate the Motor Insurance anti-Fraud and Theft Register by MIB. This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers.
Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities, including:
Claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim e.g. third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims and conviction history;
Complaints management – If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaints, including your personal information, to the relevant ombudsman;
Information about your insurance policy will be added to the MID managed by the MIB. MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the police, the DVLA, the DVA, the IFB and other bodies permitted by law. This information may be used for purposes permitted by law, which include but are not limited to:
Electronic Licensing;
Continuous insurance enforcement;
Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders);
The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.
If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the European Economic Area or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.
Persons (including his or her appointed representative) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds your current registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the police.
You can check that your current registration number with the
MID
.
How your data will be processed
Information which is supplied to fraud prevention agencies and databases, e.g. MIB and MID can include details, e.g. your name, address and date of birth;
Your data may be supplied to databases in order to facilitate automatic no claim discount validation checks;
Your data may be transferred to any country, including countries outside of the European Economic Area, for any of the purposes mentioned above;
Under your policy you must tell us about any incident (e.g. an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the fraud prevention agencies and databases e.g. MIB.
You can ask for more information about this. If you require such information, please
contact us
.
How we use your Driving Licence Number
Insurance underwriting purposes i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
Provide your (or any person included on the proposal) Driving Licence Number (DLN) to the DVLA to confirm your (or the relevant person included on the proposal) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out prior to the date of the insurance policy and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy including at the mid-term adjustment and renewal stage. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence;
Searches may be carried out at point of quote and, if an insurance policy is incepted, if any changes are made mid-term, and at renewal stage.
Please note that if you give us false or inaccurate information it may invalidate your insurance policy/prospective insurance policy or it could affect the amount we pay to settle any claims you make under the policy.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. We or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion
website.
6. Automated Decision Making
We may use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy, the price, and whether we can provide you with a monthly credit payment option.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
7. Profiling, Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence
We process Personal Information to perform profiling and data analysis to build, train and audit insurance and third party models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
.)
We also use artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Artificial intelligence is a machine’s ability to perform tasks we associate with humans. For example, problem solving, learning and decision making. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches machines to learn and interpret from information and then provide a response. One type of artificial intelligence that we use is natural language processing. Natural language processing involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this to help us with the purposes listed below.
The models, algorithms, and tools we use do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them (for further information please see
Marketing
), whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing underwriting and claims e.g. underwriting assessments, determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our processes and services e.g. by generating summaries of claims notes, looking how to prevent complaints;
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent; and
ensuring data quality and accuracy e.g. checking the way our models, algorithms and machine learning tools work.
To carry out these purposes we may combine your Personal Information with information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties. We may also use the Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
10. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
11. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information
You may ask us for a copy of your Personal Information together with specified details about how we use your information. This is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’.
If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
or write to us using the details in
Contacting Aviva
.
If your request is made electronically, we will, where possible, respond to you electronically. Otherwise, we will normally respond in writing unless you request otherwise.
Rectification of your Personal Information
We do our best to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate and kept up to date. If you believe your information is inaccurate or incomplete, then please
contact us
to request that we amend or update it.
Erasing your Personal Information
You may ask us to erase your Personal Information, but this right only applies in certain circumstances, e.g. where:
it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.
This isn’t an absolute right and we have to balance your request against other factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, which may mean we cannot erase your Personal Information.
Restricting processing of your Personal Information
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.
This isn’t an absolute right and we may not be able to comply with your request.
Data portability
In some cases, you can ask us to transfer Personal Information that you have provided to us to another third party of your choice. This right only applies where:
we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.
Right to object
You can object if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us.
You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to motor insurance policies.
If you have purchased a telematics policy through a broker, we’d also like to tell you some additional information that applies to your policy. Please ask your broker for further details regarding how we use your Personal Information.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Where you are an individual policyholder, the Aviva group company that underwrites your insurance policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy (or individuals, where it’s taken out jointly or otherwise for the benefit of others). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example, if you ask us to provide insurance for someone other than you, e.g. other household or family members. If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime, including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information. For example, we may use your past motoring convictions for motoring insurance. See
Automated Decision Making
for further details.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information-sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes National Sira administered by Synectics Solutions Limited (as joint data controller together with contributing companies, including Aviva),
Experian whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here

Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here

If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering. This may be shared between insurers and with fraud prevention agencies and databases.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details,
contact us
.
For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA
please visit their website
How your Personal Information is used and shared by insurers and databases in relation to motor insurance
The Personal Information you provide will be used by us and shared with other insurers as well as certain statutory and other authorised bodies for:
Insurance underwriting purposes, i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
consider whether to accept the relevant risk,
make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance and related services for you (and members of your household),
validate your (or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim) claims history (at any time including upon application for insurance, in the event of an accident or a claim, or mid-term adjustment, or at a time of renewal).
Management Information purposes. To analyse insurance and other markets for the purposes of:
portfolio assessment,
risk assessment,
performance reporting,
management reporting.
Anti-fraud purposes. To detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by:
sharing information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
tracing debtors or beneficiaries, recovering debt, managing your accounts and/or insurance policies;
undertaking fraud searches. Insurers pass information to fraud prevention agencies and databases including National Sira, the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register and where appropriate the Motor Insurance anti-Fraud and Theft Register by MIB. This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers. Fraud prevention agencies can hold your Personal Information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.
Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities, including:
claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim, e.g. third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims and conviction history;
complaints management – If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaints, including your Personal Information, to the relevant ombudsman;
information about your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the MIB. MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the police, the DVLA, the DVA, the IFB and other bodies permitted by law. This information may be used for purposes permitted by law, which include:
electronic licensing;
continuous insurance enforcement;
law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders);
the provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.
If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the European Economic Area or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.
Individuals who may be citizens of other countries or their appointed representatives making a claim in respect of a road traffic accident may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds your current registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the police and/or a fixed penalty notice.
You can check your current registration number with the
MID
.
How your Personal Information will be processed
Information which is supplied to fraud prevention agencies and databases, e.g. National Sira, MIB and MID can include details like your name, address and date of birth.
Your data may be supplied to databases in order to facilitate automatic no claim discount validation checks.
Your data may be transferred to any country, including countries outside of the European Economic Area, for any of the purposes mentioned above.
Under your policy you must tell us about any incident (e.g. an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the fraud prevention agencies and databases, e.g. MIB.

How we use your Driving Licence Number
Insurance underwriting purposes i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
Provide your (or any person included on the proposal) Driving Licence Number (DLN) to the DVLA to confirm your (or the relevant person included on the proposal) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out prior to the date of the insurance policy and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy including at the mid-term adjustment and renewal stage. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence;
Searches may be carried out at point of quote and, if an insurance policy is incepted, if any changes are made mid-term, and at renewal stage.
Please note that if you give us false or inaccurate information it may invalidate your insurance policy/prospective insurance policy or it could affect the amount we pay to settle any claims you make under the policy.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
When you purchase a policy from Aviva, we may undertake some checks with a credit reference agency. The checks that we do will depend on how you bought your policy and whether we offer an Aviva credit payment facility. When you buy your policy, you will be informed about these assessments before we do them.
Where you purchase your policy directly through Aviva, Aviva will carry out assessments to determine whether we can offer you an Aviva credit payment facility. The following checks will be undertaken:
We or our agents may:
undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims; and
carry out a quotation search from a credit reference agency. We do this so that we are able to offer monthly credit payment options.
We use data from a credit reference agency to verify your identity, prevent fraud and carry out risk profiling which allows us to calculate your premium and payment options. We may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested.
As part of our regulatory obligations, before we offer you your payment options, we will carry out an affordability assessment. We do this using information from a credit reference agency including an over-indebtedness score and some of the underlying data used to calculate this score. The credit reference agency calculates your over-indebtedness score using information it holds about your existing credit commitments and modelled information relating to income and living expenses. We will use your over-indebtedness score to help assess whether additional credit could cause you financial harm. We will do this when you request a quote and at renewal so that we can decide whether to offer you a monthly credit payment option.
The quotation and affordability searches will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear it is part of a quote and not a credit application by you. Where you agree to pay monthly under an Aviva credit agreement, the status of your quote search will be updated to reflect your credit application and this will be visible to other credit providers.
In order to carry out these searches we will supply your Personal Information to credit reference agencies and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness (including affordability) and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will also continue to exchange information about you with credit reference agencies on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. Credit reference agencies will share your information with other organisations. Your Personal Information will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associates.
The credit reference agency we use is TransUnion. More information about the ways in which TransUnion uses and shares Personal Information can be found, on the
TransUnion
website.
Where you purchase your policy through an intermediary (e.g. a broker or an Aviva business partner), if it is a policy with which we will assess whether we can offer you with an Aviva credit payment facility, we will undertake a number of checks, outlined in detail below.
We or our agents may:
undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims; and
carry out a quotation search from a credit reference agency. This will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear it’s a quote and not a credit application by you. We do this so that we are able to offer you a monthly credit payment option.
We use data from a credit reference agency to verify your identity, prevent fraud, assess affordability and carry out risk profiling which allows us to calculate your premium and payment options. We may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested.

Where you purchase your policy through an intermediary (e.g. a broker or an Aviva business partner), if it is a policy with which we do not offer an Aviva credit payment facility, the following checks will be undertaken:
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. We or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. the electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion website

To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested.

Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion
website.
6. Automated Decision Making
We use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy, the price, and whether we can provide you with a monthly credit payment option.
In order to provide you with a price for your insurance policy, the following steps are taken:
You provide us with data
: The first step is that you tell us who you are and what you are looking to have insured, e.g. the vehicle you drive.
We enrich the data you have provided
: Once you have provided us with data, we carry out checks to validate this data (e.g. confirming your identity) and enrich it with data from third party sources. Information on the third party data sources we use is set out above in
Types of Personal Information collected
. For example, we use the vehicle registration number you provided to source additional information on the car you drive from the DVLA.
We calculate your insurance risk
: We use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data in order to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made and the likely severity of a claim. This assessment is based on various factors including information about the area you live in such as the likelihood of crime and the cost of repairs in your area. For example, if you live in an area with high vehicle crime this may lead to a higher premium. All insurers will use different weightings to price insurance and this is confidential to each insurer.
Provision of the final price
: Once we have a view of your insurance risk we can provide you with a final price, which will include any commission payments and insurance premium tax.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
7. Profiling, Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence
We process Personal Information to perform profiling and data analysis to build, train and audit insurance and third party models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
).
We also use artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Artificial intelligence is a machine’s ability to perform tasks we associate with humans. For example, problem solving, learning and decision making. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches machines to learn and interpret from information and then provide a response. One type of artificial intelligence that we use is natural language processing. Natural language processing involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this to help us with the purposes listed below.
The models, algorithms and tools we use help us do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g., how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them (for further information please see
Marketing
), whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing claims e.g. determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our processes and services e.g. by generating summaries of claims notes, looking how to prevent complaints;
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent; and
ensuring data quality and accuracy e.g. checking the way our models, algorithms and machine learning tools work.
To carry out these purposes we may combine your Personal Information with information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties. We may also use the Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
10. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
11. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information
You may ask us for a copy of your Personal Information together with specified details about how we use your information. This is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’.
If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
or write to us using the details in
Contacting Aviva
.
If your request is made electronically, we will, where possible, respond to you electronically. Otherwise, we will normally respond in writing unless you request otherwise.
Rectification of your Personal Information
We do our best to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate and kept up to date. If you believe your information is inaccurate or incomplete, then please
contact us
to request that we amend or update it.
Erasing your Personal Information
You may ask us to erase your Personal Information, but this right only applies in certain circumstances, e.g. where:
it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.
This isn’t an absolute right and we have to balance your request against other factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, which may mean we cannot erase your Personal Information.
Restricting processing of your Personal Information
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.
This isn’t an absolute right and we may not be able to comply with your request.
Data portability
In some cases, you can ask us to transfer Personal Information that you have provided to us to another third party of your choice. This right only applies where:
we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.
Right to object
You can object if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us.
You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to home insurance policies.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Where you are an individual policyholder, the Aviva group company that underwrites your insurance policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please

. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy (or other individuals where it’s taken out jointly or otherwise for the benefit of others). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example if you ask us to provide insurance for someone other than you such as other household or family members.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crimes.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess if your application or claim may be fraudulent.

Automated Decision Making
.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers ( e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes National Sira administered by Synectics Solutions Limited (as joint data controller together with contributing companies, including Aviva),
Experian whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here

Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here

We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
How your data is used and shared by Insurers and Databases in relation to household insurance
Show
The data you provide will be used by us and shared with other insurers as well as certain statutory and other authorised bodies for:
Insurance underwriting purposes, i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
consider whether to accept the relevant risk;
make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance and related services for you and members of your household;
validate your (or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim) claims history (at any time, including upon application for insurance, in the event of an incident or a claim, or mid-term adjustment, or at a time of renewal).
Management information purposes, i.e. to analyse insurance and other markets for the purposes of:
portfolio assessment;
risk assessment;
performance reporting;
management reporting.
Anti-fraud purposes i.e. to detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by:
sharing information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
tracing debtors or beneficiaries, recovering debt, managing your accounts and/or insurance policies;
undertaking fraud searches. Insurers pass information to the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register administered by Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers.
Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities, including:
claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim, e.g. third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims history;
complaints management - If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaint, including your Personal Information, to the relevant ombudsman.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
When you purchase a policy from Aviva, we may undertake some checks with a credit reference agency. The checks that we do will depend on how you bought your policy and whether we offer an Aviva credit payment facility. When you buy your policy, you will be informed about these assessments before we do them.
Where you purchase your policy through Aviva or certain of our business partners, and if it is a policy with which we will assess whether we can offer you with an Aviva credit payment facility, the following checks will be undertaken:
We or our agents may:
undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims; and
carry out a quotation search from a credit reference agency. We do this so that we are able to offer monthly credit payment options.
We use data from a credit reference agency to verify your identity, prevent fraud and carry out risk profiling which allows us to calculate your premium and payment options. We
may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested.
As part of our regulatory obligations, before we offer you your payment options, we will carry out an affordability assessment. We do this using information from a credit reference agency including an over-indebtedness score and some of the underlying data used to calculate this score. The credit reference agency calculates your over-indebtedness score using information it holds about your existing credit commitments and modelled information relating to income and living expenses. We will use your over-indebtedness score to help assess whether additional credit could cause you financial harm. We will do this when you request a quote and at renewal so that we can decide whether to offer you a monthly credit payment option.
The quotation and affordability searches will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear it is part of a quote and not a credit application by you. Where you agree to pay monthly under an Aviva credit agreement, the status of your quote search will be updated to reflect your credit application and this will be visible to other credit providers.
In order to carry out these searches we
will supply your Personal Information to credit reference agencies and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness (including affordability) and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will also continue to exchange information about you with credit reference agencies on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. credit reference agencies will share your information with other organisations. Your Personal Information will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associates.
The credit reference agency we use is TransUnion. More information about the ways in which TransUnion uses and shares Personal Information can be found on the
TransUnion website
.
Where you purchase your policy through a broker, if it is a policy with which Aviva offers an Aviva credit payment facility, we will undertake a number of checks, outlined in detail below. We or our agents may:
undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims,
carry out a quotation search from a credit reference agency. This will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear it’s a quote and not a credit application by you. We do this so that we are able to offer you a monthly credit payment option.
We use data from a credit reference agency to verify your identity, prevent fraud, assess affordibility and carry out risk profiling which allows us to calculate your premium and payment options. We may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested.
Where you agree to pay monthly under an Aviva credit agreement, the status of your quotation search from the credit reference agency will be updated to reflect your credit application and this will be visible to other credit providers.
In order to assess your application we will supply your Personal Information to our credit reference agency and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness (including affordability) and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will also continue to exchange information about you with credit reference agencies on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. credit reference agencies will share your information with other organisations. Your data will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associates.
The credit reference agency we use is TransUnion. More information about the ways in which TransUnion uses and shares Personal Information can be found on the
TransUnion website
.
Where you purchase your policy through an intermediary (e.g. a broker or an Aviva business partner), if it is a policy with which we do not offer an Aviva credit payment facility, the following checks will be undertaken:
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. We or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (such as electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion
website.

6. Automated Decision Making
We use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy, the price, and whether we can provide you with a monthly credit payment option.
In order to provide you with a price for your insurance policy, the following steps are taken:
You provide us with data
: The first step is that you tell us who you are and what you are looking to have insured, e.g. details about your property.
We enrich the data you have provided
: Once you have provided us with data, we carry out checks to validate this data (e.g. confirming your identity) and enrich it with data from third party sources. Information on the third party data sources we use is set out above in
Types of Personal Information collected
. For example, we use your address to source additional information on the area you live in such as the distance of your property from a river.
We calculate your insurance risk
: We use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data in order to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made and the likely severity of a claim. This assessment is based on various factors including information about the area you live in such as the likelihood of crime and the cost of repairs in your area. For example, if you live in an area with high property crime this may lead to a higher premium. All insurers will use different weightings to price insurance and this is confidential to each insurer.
Provision of the final price
: Once we have a view of your insurance risk we can provide you with a final price, which will include any commission payments and insurance premium tax.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
7. Profiling, Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence
We process Personal Information to perform profiling and data analysis to build, train and audit insurance and third party models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
.)
We also use artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Artificial intelligence is a machine’s ability to perform tasks we associate with humans. For example, problem solving, learning and decision making. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches machines to learn and interpret from information and then provide a response. One type of artificial intelligence that we use is natural language processing. Natural language processing involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this to help us with the purposes listed below.
The models, algorithms, and tools we use do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them (for further information please see
Marketing
), whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing underwriting and claims e.g. underwriting assessments, determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our processes and services e.g. by generating summaries of claims notes, looking how to prevent complaints;
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent; and
ensuring data quality and accuracy e.g. checking the way our models, algorithms and machine learning tools work.
To carry out these purposes we may combine your Personal Information with information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties. We may also use the Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
10. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
11. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information

contact us

Erasing your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to erase your Personal Information, but this right only applies in certain circumstances, e.g. where:
it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.
This isn’t an absolute right and we have to balance your request against other factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, which may mean we cannot erase your Personal Information.
Restricting processing of your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.
This isn’t an absolute right and we may not be able to comply with your request.
Data portability
Show
In some cases, you can ask us to transfer Personal Information that you have provided to us to another third party of your choice. This right only applies where:
we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.
Right to object
Show
You can object if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us.
You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
Show
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
Show
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to travel insurance policies.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Where you are an individual policyholder, the Aviva group company that underwrites your insurance policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy (or individuals where it’s taken out jointly or otherwise for the benefit of others). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example, if you ask us to provide insurance for someone other than you, e.g. other household or family members. If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.
2. Personal Information We Collect and How it is Used
Sources of Personal Information
We obtain Personal Information directly from you, including from application and claims forms that you complete, communications between us, your participation in promotions and market research, and your use of our apps and websites, as well as details from the devices you use to interact with our apps and websites. Where you are a joint policyholder, an additional traveller or otherwise a beneficiary under a policy we will also obtain Personal Information from the named policyholder.
We may also obtain Personal Information from third parties, including the following:
Insurance brokers, financial advisers or one of our business partners, where you have obtained a product through one of these third parties;
Comparison websites and other similar companies where you have used these companies to obtain quotes for travel insurance products;
Third parties who provide you with services relating to your product, e.g. travel assistance providers and healthcare providers;
Third parties who provide us, or a third party insurer relevant to your product or claim, with services, e.g. loss adjusters, claims handlers (e.g. CEGA Group Services Limited), legal advisers, assistance providers, experts and, in limited circumstances, private investigators;
Third parties involved in your product or claim including other insurers, brokers, assistance providers, claimants, defendants and witnesses to an incident;

Financial crime and fraud detection agencies, databases and sanctions lists, including the Claims Underwriting Exchange (CUE) and Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB);
Government agencies and regulatory bodies including the police, the courts, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Companies House and HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC);
Regulators who regulate how we operate including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS);
Insurance industry bodies including the Association of British Insurers;
Debt advisors, including where breathing space is requested on outstanding debts;
Third parties who provide us with details of individuals who have expressed an interest in hearing about insurance products;
Third party suppliers that provide services in relation to your policy or claim, including checking no claims discounts,
Third parties that help us maintain the accuracy of our data e.g. by identifying individuals who are deceased, updating contact details for individuals who have moved and payment card providers who provide us with updated payment card details;
Other third party suppliers including actuaries, auditors, legal advisers and other professional service firms and sanctions-checking service providers;
Data suppliers, e.g. Experian and
LexisNexis
;
Publicly available sources, e.g. data made available under the Open Government Licence, including internet searches, news articles, online marketplaces and social media sites, apps and networks (e.g. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram);
Providers of marketing and advertising services;
Third parties in connection with any acquisition of a business by us.
Types of Personal Information collected
The Personal Information we hold and process will differ depending on our relationship with you. For example, where you have cover as part of an arrangement with one of our business partners, e.g. your bank, we will collect and use Personal Information differently than if you purchase a single trip or annual insurance policy on its own. For example, if you receive cover as part of an arrangement with one of our business partners, we may process less information about you when your cover starts. You will need to provide us with Personal Information if you need to make a claim or declare a medical condition. The Personal Information we hold and process includes:
Information provided by you or third parties, including:
General data – includes your name, date of birth, marital status, country of residence/citizenship and your relationships to other people, e.g. family members on a joint insurance policy;
Contact data – includes your address, telephone number and e-mail address;
Identification data – includes government issued identification numbers e.g. your national insurance number, passport number or driving licence number and other identifiers e.g. usernames and social media identifiers;
Appearance and behavioural data – includes your gender, age, general interests, descriptive data e.g. your height, images, demographic data and behavioural data, e.g. your purchase history;
Product data – includes information about quotations, policies, schemes and claims and any other information relevant to your product, including details regarding your travel arrangements, any sports and other activities you plan to undertake when travelling, e.g. scuba diving or skiing, renewal dates and your policy and claim histories;
Claims data – if a claim is made under an insurance policy, this includes information about the claim collected from your and relevant third parties, e.g. witnesses;
Fraud and sanctions related data – includes information obtained as a result of our investigations, e.g. carrying out checks of publicly available sources such as newspapers and social media sites and information obtained from checks of fraud databases and sanctions lists such as relationships/close associations with politically exposed persons;
Education and employment-related data – includes your education, vocational and professional qualifications, employment status, job title and employment and educational history;
Financial data – includes credit and payment card numbers (including updated card information provided by card issuers when changes are made), bank account details, payment information, whether you provide a continuous payment authority, tax information and details of income and assets;
Credit assessment data – includes information received from credit agencies e.g. details of bankruptcy orders, voluntary arrangements and county court judgments;
Vulnerability data – information about health, life events, resilience and capability that helps us identify if you might have additional support requirements in order that we can better meet your needs;
Authentication data – includes account log-in information, passwords and memorable data for accessing your Aviva accounts;
Telephone recordings and online chat transcripts – information obtained during recordings of telephone calls or online chats with our representatives and call centres;
Marketing and communication preferences, promotion entries and customer feedback – includes marketing and communication preferences, information relating to promotions and prize draws, responses to surveys, complaints and details of your customer experience.
Information provided by third parties, including:
An individual risk score where you disclose a medical condition. We use a third party tool to assess the additional risk that such medical condition poses and we use the score generated in order to generate a more accurate price for your insurance policy;
Accurate contact data, e.g. where you have moved address, changed your telephone number or started using a new email address and not yet advised Aviva. This data may be used to ensure that we have a complete understanding of your product holding and to provide you with communications about your products. It will not be used for direct marketing purposes unless it was collected by the third party expressly for that purpose and always in accordance with data protection law.
Information collected from your devices, including:
Mobile device number, device type, operating system, browser, IMEI or serial number, MAC address, IP address, location and account activity obtained through our use of cookies. You can find more about our use of cookies in our
Cookies Policy
.

Data relating to other Aviva policies – e.g. quote, policy and claim histories relating to other existing Aviva policies or products or those you may have applied for or held in the past, and contact details where you may have advised Aviva about a change on one product, but not another;
Modelled data that has been developed by Aviva using data that it already holds. For example, we use claims data to identify customers who are likely to claim more than others.
Information inferred from your Personal Information, including:
Appearance and behavioural data – includes your general interests, descriptive data and behavioural data to allow us to make certain predictions and assumptions about your interests, which allows us to personalise your experience with us;
Vulnerability data – information about health, life events, resilience and capability that helps us identify if you might have additional support requirements in order that we can better meet your needs;
Fraud and sanctions-related data – includes information obtained as a result of our investigations, e.g. carrying out checks of publicly available sources, such as newspapers and social media sites and checks of fraud databases and sanctions lists.
Children’s data:
We collect data about children in some circumstances e.g. where a child is insured on an adult's policy, where a child takes out a policy with us, e.g. travel insurance for under 18s or where a child is a claimant.
Sensitive Personal Information
Sometimes we will request or receive Personal Information that is sensitive and we call this “Sensitive Personal Information”. This is information relating to your health, genetic or biometric data, sex life, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs and trade union membership. It also covers criminal offence data, including information about criminal activity, allegations (including those unproven), investigations, proceedings and penalties. For example, to investigate a bodily injury claim, we’ll need to ask you to provide details of the injury. We know how sensitive this data is, so protecting it is a top priority. The types of Sensitive Personal Information we hold and process where relevant include:
Health data – includes details of existing and previous physical or mental health conditions, health status, test results, medical diagnoses and treatment of you and any person insured under a policy. If you or anyone insured under a policy has declared medical conditions, a third party may provide us with a 'risk score' in order for us to calculate your premium. See
Automated Decision Making
for more information. We also collect details regarding any illness (including medication and treatment) or personal injury about you or other beneficiaries when you make a claim under the policy;
Criminal data – includes details of convictions, e.g. in relation to fraud;
Other sensitive data - in limited circumstances we may process other Sensitive Personal Information. For example, we may process information relating to your religious beliefs where relevant to your preferences regarding medical treatment provided under your travel policy.

.
4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess if your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information. For further details, see
Automated Decision Making
.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes the
Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared between insurers.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details, please
contact us
.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. We or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion
website.
6. Automated Decision Making
We may use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy and whether we can provide cover for medical conditions disclosed to us, the price, and whether we can provide you with a monthly credit payment option.
In order to provide you with a price for your insurance policy, the following steps are taken:
You provide us with data
: The first step is that you tell us who you are and what type of insurance you are looking for, e.g. single trip travel insurance for a week in Europe.
We enrich the data you have provided
: Once you have provided us with data, we carry out checks to validate this data (e.g. confirming your identity) and enrich it with data from third party sources. Information on the third party data sources we use is set out above in
Types of Personal Information collected
. For example, where you declare a pre-existing medical condition we use third party information to assess how much risk the medical condition poses.
We calculate your insurance risk
: We use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data in order to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made and the likely severity of a claim. This assessment is based on various factors including information about the area you are planning to visit. For example, if you are travelling to an area where the cost of medical treatment is high, this may lead to a higher premium. All insurers will use different weightings to price insurance and this is confidential to each insurer.
Provision of the final price
: Once we have a view of your insurance risk we can provide you with a final price, which will include any commission payments and insurance premium tax.
Where you are provided with cover as part of an arrangement with one of our business partners, e.g. your bank, we will not make any automated decisions when your insurance policy starts unless you declare a medical condition. If you declare a medical condition, we may carry out some automated decision making to decide whether we can provide cover, and on what terms, for that medical condition.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision.
In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
7. Profiling and Data Analysis
We use profiling and other data analysis to build, train and audit our insurance models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
) and our machine-learning tools. The models, algorithms and tools we use help us do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them, whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing claims e.g. determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our services e.g. looking at how to prevent complaints; and
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
One technique we may use is natural language processing. Natural language processing is a machine learning tool that involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this tool to help us with the purposes listed above e.g. we may use it to assess how you are feeling about Aviva based on the words that you use to communicate with us.
We may also use profiling and data analysis for other reasons, e.g. to ensure data quality and accuracy and to help us improve our business.
The purpose of this analysis is not to make decisions about you directly, but your Personal Information, in combination with Personal Information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties, will be used to conduct data analysis so that we can improve our processes, our products and services and check the way our models, algorithms and machine-learning tools work. The Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us may be used for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the data in order to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
We also use profiling in relation to marketing. For further information please see
Marketing
.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
10. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
11. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information
You may ask us for a copy of your Personal Information together with specified details about how we use your information. This is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’.
If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
or write to us using the details in
Contacting Aviva
.
If your request is made electronically, we will, where possible, respond to you electronically. Otherwise, we will normally respond in writing unless you request otherwise.
Rectification of your Personal Information
We do our best to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate and kept up to date. If you believe your information is inaccurate or incomplete, then please
contact us
to request that we amend or update it.
Erasing your Personal Information
You may ask us to erase your Personal Information, but this right only applies in certain circumstances, e.g. where:
it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.
This isn’t an absolute right and we have to balance your request against other factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, which may mean we cannot erase your Personal Information.
Restricting processing of your Personal Information
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our personal accident insurance policies.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Where you are an individual policyholder, the Aviva group company that underwrites your insurance policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy (or individuals where it’s taken out jointly or otherwise for the benefit of others). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example, if you ask us to provide insurance for someone other than you, e.g. other household or family members.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.
2. Personal Information We Collect and How it is Used

We obtain Personal Information directly from you, including from application and claims forms that you complete, communications between us, your participation in promotions and market research, your use of our apps and websites, as well as details from the devices you use to interact with our apps and websites.

Lawful Bases for uses of Personal Information
We are committed to collecting and using Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws. By law, we must have a legal justification, known as a lawful basis, in order to use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Depending upon the purpose, our lawful basis will be one of the following:
Performance of a contract – to arrange, underwrite or manage our products, or handle claims in accordance with their terms;
Compliance with a legal obligation – to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or other legal responsibilities;
Legitimate interests – to operate and improve our products and services and keep people informed about our products and services or for any other purposes we identify as appropriate to our business needs, or those business needs of a third party;
Consent – where we have obtained appropriate consents to collect or use your Personal Information for a particular purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual. The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether we can use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests, the interests being relied upon will usually be:
To further our business and commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party, e.g. to provide our products and services and produce management information on our performance and the performance of third parties;
To help us better understand our customers and improve our customer engagement and marketing campaigns including by carrying out marketing analysis and profiling, e.g. by making certain predictions and assumptions about your interests;
To send you marketing information in accordance with your preferences, e.g. about other products and services we offer, and to administer promotions that you enter;
To provide you with helpful information relating to your products and about useful tools for managing and engaging with your products, e.g. the MyAviva app. These are not marketing communications;
To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, guidelines, standards and codes of conduct, e.g. background checks or the prevention, detection and investigation of financial crime or fraud;
To improve and develop our business, products and services, or those of a third party, e.g. to ensure the accuracy of customer data and to develop our pricing and risk methods and models;
To retain your policy record for a period of time in order to ensure we have appropriate records in place in respect of any future claims that may be insured by us;
To safeguard our business, shareholders, employees and customers, or those of a third party, e.g. maintaining the security of our IT network and information, enforcing claims, including debt collection;
To facilitate the purchase, sale, transfer or disposal of any part of our business; and
To analyse and assess competition in the market for our products and services, e.g. by carrying out market research.

This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services, e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared between insurers.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. We or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion
website.
6. Automated Decision Making
We may use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy, the price, and whether we can provide you with a monthly credit payment option.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
7. Profiling and Data Analysis
We use profiling and other data analysis to build, train and audit our insurance models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
) and our machine-learning tools. The models, algorithms and tools we use help us do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them, whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing claims e.g. determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our services e.g. looking at how to prevent complaints; and
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
One technique we may use is natural language processing. Natural language processing is a machine learning tool that involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this tool to help us with the purposes listed above e.g. we may use it to assess how you are feeling about Aviva based on the words that you use to communicate with us.
We may also use profiling and data analysis for other reasons, e.g. to ensure data quality and accuracy and to help us improve our business.
The purpose of this analysis is not to make decisions about you directly, but your Personal Information, in combination with Personal Information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties, will be used to conduct data analysis so that we can improve our processes, our products and services and check the way our models, algorithms and machine-learning tools work. The Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us may be used for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information in order to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name, and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
We also use profiling in relation to marketing. For further information please see
Marketing
.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
10. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
11. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information
You may ask us for a copy of your Personal Information together with specified details about how we use your information. This is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’.
If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
or write to us using the details in
Contacting Aviva
.
If your request is made electronically, we will, where possible, respond to you electronically. Otherwise, we will normally respond in writing unless you request otherwise.
Rectification of your Personal Information
We do our best to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate and kept up to date. If you believe your information is inaccurate or incomplete, then please
contact us
to request that we amend or update it.
Erasing your Personal Information
You may ask us to erase your Personal Information, but this right only applies in certain circumstances, e.g. where:
it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.
This isn’t an absolute right and we have to balance your request against other factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, which may mean we cannot erase your Personal Information.
Restricting processing of your Personal Information
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.
This isn’t an absolute right and we may not be able to comply with your request.
Data portability
In some cases, you can ask us to transfer Personal Information that you have provided to us to another third party of your choice. This right only applies where:
we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.
Right to object
You can object if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us.
You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our health products.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Where you are an individual policyholder or a member on a policy (including as a beneficiary under a healthcare trust), the Aviva group company that underwrites your insurance policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy. We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it., e.g:
if you ask us to provide insurance for other household or family members, or members of a group;
if we ask an insured person to provide health information about other family members where this is relevant to the risk we’re covering when we arrange a policy or handle a claim; and
if your policy covers support or treatment for other individuals such as your spouse, family or friends.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so you might find it helpful to show them this Privacy Policy and if they have any concerns please
contact us
.
2. Personal Information We Collect and How it is Used

It also covers criminal offence data, including information about criminal activity, allegations (including those unproven), investigations, proceedings and penalties. For example, to investigate a claim made under a private medical insurance policy, we’ll need to ask you to provide details of your health condition. We know how sensitive this data is, so protecting it is a top priority. The types of Sensitive Personal Information we hold and process where relevant include:
Health data – includes details of existing and previous physical or mental health conditions, health status, test results, medical diagnoses and treatment;
Criminal data – includes details of convictions, e.g. in relation to fraud;
Other sensitive data – in limited circumstances we may process other Sensitive Personal Information. For example, we may process information relating to your religious beliefs where relevant to your preferences regarding medical treatment.

Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual.

;
Third parties in connection with any sale, transfer or disposal of our business.

International Data Transfers
.
4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation fraud and financial crimes.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information. For further details, see
Automated Decision Making
.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes the
Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services, e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared with other parties.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
5. Automated Decision Making
We may use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy and the price.
In order to provide you with a price for your insurance policy, the following steps are taken:
You provide us with data
: The first step is that you tell us who you are and what you are looking to have insured, e.g. details about yourself and any family members to be covered.
We enrich the data you have provided
: Once you have provided us with data, we carry out checks to validate this data (e.g. confirming your identity) and enrich it with data from third party sources. Information on the third party data sources we use is set out above in
Types of Personal Information collected
. For example, we use your postcode to source additional information such as the prevalence of certain diseases in your area.
We calculate your insurance risk
: We use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data in order to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made and the likely severity of a claim. This assessment is based on various factors. For example, customers who are older are more likely to claim due to the increased likelihood of illness as the body ages this may lead to a higher premium. All insurers will use different weightings to price insurance and this is confidential to each insurer.
Provision of the final price
: Once we have a view of your insurance risk we can provide you with a final price, which will include any commission payments and insurance premium tax.
Where you are covered under a corporate health policy or trust, we will likely not make any automated decisions using your Personal Information in order to underwrite the insurance policy. If you make a claim, your claims information may be used by us in order to calculate your employer’s renewal price.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
6. Profiling, Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence
We process Personal Information to perform profiling and data analysis to build, train and audit insurance and third party models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
.)
We also use artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Artificial intelligence is a machine’s ability to perform tasks we associate with humans. For example, problem solving, learning and decision making. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches machines to learn and interpret from information and then provide a response. One type of artificial intelligence that we use is natural language processing. Natural language processing involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this to help us with the purposes listed below.
The models, algorithms, and tools we use do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them (for further information please see
Marketing
), whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing underwriting and claims e.g. underwriting assessments, determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our processes and services e.g. by generating summaries of claims notes, looking how to prevent complaints;
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent; and
ensuring data quality and accuracy e.g. checking the way our models, algorithms and machine learning tools work.
To carry out these purposes we may combine your Personal Information with information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties. We may also use the Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
7. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
8. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
9. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
10. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our individual protection insurance policies.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Aviva group company that provides the policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy (or individuals where it’s taken out jointly), or the individuals covered under the policy. If the policy is placed under trust, then the appointed trustees will be legal owners of the policy and so we will also process details of the trustees. We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example:
details about beneficiaries under a policy; and
health information about other family members where this is relevant to the risk we’re covering when we arrange a policy or when we handle a claim.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process Personal Information about such individuals according to this Privacy Policy so it may be helpful to show them this Privacy Policy and if they have any concerns please
contact us
.

Health data – includes details of existing and previous physical or mental health conditions, health status, test results, medical diagnoses and treatment given, prescriptions and personal habits (e.g. smoking or use of tobacco products);

Lawful Bases for uses of Personal Information
Show
We are committed to collecting and using Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws. By law, we must have a legal justification, known as a lawful basis, in order to use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Depending upon the purpose, our lawful basis will be one of the following:
Performance of a contract – to arrange, underwrite or manage our products, or handle claims in accordance with their terms;
Compliance with a legal obligation – to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or other legal responsibilities;
Legitimate interests – to operate and improve our products and services and keep people informed about our products and services or for any other purposes we identify as appropriate to our business needs, or those business needs of a third party;
Consent – where we have obtained appropriate consents to collect or use your Personal Information for a particular purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual. The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether we can use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests, the interests being relied upon will usually be:
To further our business and commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party, e.g., to provide our products and services and produce management information on our performance and the performance of third parties;
To help us better understand our customers and improve our customer engagement and marketing campaigns including by carrying out analysis and profiling, e.g. by making certain predictions and assumptions about your interests;

To provide you with helpful information relating to your products and about useful tools for managing and engaging with your products, e.g. the MyAviva app. These are not marketing communications;
To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, guidelines, standards and codes of conduct, e.g., background checks or the prevention, detection and investigation of financial crime or fraud;
To improve and develop our business, products and services, or those of a third party, e.g. to ensure the accuracy of customer data and to develop our pricing and risk methods and models;
To retain your policy record for a period of time in order to ensure we have appropriate records in place in respect of any future claims that may be insured by us;
To safeguard our business, shareholders, employees and customers, or a third party, e.g., maintaining the security of our IT network and information, enforcing claims, including debt collection;
To facilitate the purchase, sale, transfer or disposal of any part of our business; and
To analyse and assess competition in the market for our products services, e.g., by carrying out market research.

This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries. Our searches of credit reference agency databases may appear on your credit report and may be visible to other credit providers. These searches will not affect your credit rating.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared with other parties.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion website
.
6. Automated Decision Making
We may make decisions about you based on automated decision making. Our automated process helps us to make predictions, e.g., the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased or the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy and the price.
We use automated processes to assess applications, which uses the Personal Information you have provided, including Sensitive Personal Information and information we receive from third parties as set out in
Types of Personal Information collected
. We may also validate information you provide against other records we hold about you in our systems and third party databases.
For example, an automated decision in relation to the price of your life insurance policy is based on various factors including the health outcomes in the area you live, any existing medical conditions and your answers to our lifestyle questions, e.g. whether you smoke. If you have pre-existing conditions and are a heavy smoker, your premium will be higher than if you have no pre-existing conditions and are a non-smoker.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. when selecting customers’ applications to be reviewed for possible non-disclosures or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
7. Profiling, Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence
We process Personal Information to perform profiling and data analysis to build, train and audit insurance and third party models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
.)
We also use artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Artificial intelligence is a machine’s ability to perform tasks we associate with humans. For example, problem solving, learning and decision making. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches machines to learn and interpret from information and then provide a response. One type of artificial intelligence that we use is natural language processing. Natural language processing involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this to help us with the purposes listed below.
The models, algorithms, and tools we use do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g., how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them (for further information please see
Marketing
), whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing underwriting and claims e.g. underwriting assessments, determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our processes and services e.g. by generating summaries of claims notes, looking how to prevent complaints;
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent; and
ensuring data quality and accuracy e.g. checking the way our models, algorithms and machine learning tools work.
To carry out these purposes we may combine your Personal Information with information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties. We may also use the Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
10. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
11. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information

it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.

Restricting processing of your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.

Data portability
Show

we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.
Right to object
Show
You can object if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us.
You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
Show
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
Show
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our group protection products.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Aviva group company that provides the policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information with other companies in the Aviva group in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the member and/or their family covered under a policy taken out by the member’s employer. We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example, if the policy is written under trust we will ask for details about the trustee and beneficiaries.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, including if you are an employer providing Personal Information about your employees or someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process Personal Information about such individuals according to this Privacy Policy so it may be helpful to show them this Privacy Policy and if they have any concerns please
contact us
.

We collect data about children in some circumstances e.g. where they are eligible for a child’s critical illness claim or where they are beneficiaries of a policy in trust.
Sensitive Personal Information
Sometimes we will request or receive Personal Information that is sensitive and we call this “Sensitive Personal Information”. This is information relating to your health, genetic or biometric data, sex life, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs and trade union membership.
It also covers criminal offence data, including information about criminal activity, allegations (including those unproven), investigations, proceedings and penalties. For example, to investigate a claim made under a critical illness or income protection policy, we’ll need to ask you to provide details of your health condition. We know how sensitive this data is, so protecting it is a top priority. The types of Sensitive Personal Information we hold and process where relevant includes:
Health data – includes details of existing and previous physical or mental health conditions, health status, test results, medical diagnoses and treatment given, prescriptions and personal habits (e.g. smoking or consumption of alcohol);
Criminal data – includes details of convictions, e.g. in relation to fraud;
Other sensitive data – in limited circumstances we may process other Sensitive Personal Information. For example, we may process information relating to your religious beliefs where relevant to your preferences regarding medical treatment.

Lawful Bases for uses of Personal Information
Show
We are committed to collecting and using Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws. By law, we must have a legal justification, known as a lawful basis, in order to use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Depending upon the purpose, our lawful basis will be one of the following:
Performance of a contract – to arrange, underwrite or manage our products, or handle claims in accordance with their terms;
Compliance with a legal obligation – to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or other legal responsibilities;
Legitimate interests – to operate and improve our products and services and keep people informed about our products and services or for any other purposes we identify as appropriate to our business needs, or those business needs of a third party;
Consent – where we have obtained appropriate consents to collect or use your Personal Information for a particular purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual. The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether we can use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests, the interests being relied upon will usually be:
To further our business and commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party, e.g. to provide our products and services and produce management information on our performance and the performance of third parties;
To provide cover to you under a group policy where your employer is the policyholder;
To provide you with helpful information relating to your products and about useful tools for managing and engaging with your products. These are not marketing communications;
To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, guidelines, standards and codes of conduct, e.g. background checks or the prevention, detection and investigation of financial crime or fraud;
To improve and develop our business, products and services, or those of a third party, e.g. to ensure the accuracy of customer data and to develop our pricing and risk methods and models;
To retain policy records for a period of time in order to ensure we have appropriate records in place in respect of any future claims that may be insured by us;
To safeguard our business, shareholders, employees and customers, or those of a third party, e.g. maintaining the security of our IT network and information, enforcing claims, including debt collection;
To facilitate the purchase, sale, transfer or disposal of any part of our business; and
To analyse and assess competition in the market for our products services, e.g. by carrying out market research.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraudulent practices, fight financial and other financial crime and including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud, we:
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes the
Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services, e.g. paying claims, and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared with other parties.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
5. Profiling and Data Analysis
We may use your Personal Information to perform analysis, e.g. to help us to ensure data quality and accuracy, improve our business, train our machine-learning systems and ensure we’re appropriately pricing our products. The purpose of this analysis is not to make decisions about you directly, but your information, in combination with data relating to other customers and/or data provided by third parties, will be used to conduct data analysis. This may help us to identify trends or better understand insurance risk factors which in turn mean that we price our policies effectively. Where possible we pseudonymise the Personal Information in order to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
6. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
7. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
8. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information

it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.

Restricting processing of your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.

Data portability
Show

Right to object
Show

You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
Show
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
Show
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our retirement products and services.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Aviva group company that provides the product or service will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited) with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a product (or individuals where it’s taken out jointly). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example:
if you ask us to provide a product for other household or family members;
if we ask you to provide health information about other family members where this is relevant to the risk we’re covering;
where you nominate an individual to receive payments upon your death; and
where there are other people who are occupants at the property which is subject to a lifetime mortgage.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else including if you are an employer providing Personal Information about your employees or someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime such as market abuse including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services, e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared with other parties.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
5. Automated Decision Making
We sometimes use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions about the likelihood of certain events, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy and the price.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
6. Profiling and Data Analysis
We use profiling and other data analysis to build, train and audit our insurance models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
) and our machine-learning tools. The models, algorithms and tools we use help us do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them, whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us; and
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
We may also use profiling and data analysis for other reasons, e.g. to ensure data quality and accuracy and to help us improve our business.
The purpose of this analysis is not to make decisions about you directly, but your Personal Information, in combination with Personal Information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties, will be used to conduct data analysis so that we can improve our processes, our products and services and the services being provided by third parties. We also use your Personal Information to check the way our models, algorithms and machine-learning tools work. The Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us may be used for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information in order to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name, and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
We also use profiling in relation to marketing. For further information please see
Marketing
.
7. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
8. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
9. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
10. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our investments products.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Aviva group company that provides the product or service will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you have an investment product provided by Aviva Investors, please see the Aviva Investors privacy notice, which can be found
here
. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited and Succession Wealth).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, including if you are an employer providing Personal Information about your employees or someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

Sensitive Personal Information
Sometimes we will request or receive Personal Information that is sensitive and we call this “Sensitive Personal Information”. This is information relating to your health, genetic or biometric data, sex life, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs and trade union membership. It also covers criminal offence data, including information about criminal activity, allegations (including those unproven), investigations, proceedings and penalties. For example, if we receive a confiscation order from the court, this will contain information about a criminal offence, or if an application is made for a discounted gift trust we use health data to assess the risk.

Lawful Bases for uses of Personal Information
Show
We are committed to collecting and using Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws. By law, we must have a legal justification, known as a lawful basis, in order to use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Depending upon the purpose, our lawful basis will be one of the following:
Performance of a contract – to provide you with our products and services in accordance with their terms;
Compliance with a legal obligation – to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or other legal responsibilities;
Legitimate interests – to operate and improve our products and services and keep people informed about our products and services or for any other purposes we identify as appropriate to our business needs, or those business needs of a third party;
Consent – where we have obtained appropriate consents to collect or use your Personal Information for a particular purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual. The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether we can use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests, the interests being relied upon will usually be:
To further our business and commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party, e.g. to provide our products and services and produce management information on our performance and the performance of third parties;
To assist your employer (past and current) and third parties that are providing services to both you and your employer in respect of the administration, governance and evaluation of a workplace savings product;
To help us better understand our customers and improve our customer engagement including by carrying out marketing analytics and profiling, e.g. by making certain predictions and assumptions about your interests;

To provide you with helpful information relating to your products and about useful tools for managing and engaging with your products, e.g. the MyAviva app. These are not marketing communications;
To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, guidelines, standards and codes of conduct, e.g. background checks or the prevention, detection and investigation of financial crime or fraud;
To improve and develop our business, products and services, or those of a third party, e.g. to ensure the accuracy of customer data and to develop our pricing and risk methods and models;
To retain records for a period of time in order to ensure we have appropriate records in place in respect of any future claims that may be made against us;
To safeguard our business, shareholders, employees and customers, or those of a third party, e.g. maintaining the security of our IT network and information, enforcing claims, including debt collection;
To facilitate the purchase, sale, transfer or disposal of any part of our business; and
To analyse and assess competition in the market for our products services, e.g., by carrying out market research.

.
4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime such as market abuse including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation fraud and financial crimes.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
We also use your Personal Information to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared with other parties.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
5. Automated Decision Making
We sometimes use automated processes to make decisions.  These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions about the likelihood of certain events, including the likelihood a product will be purchased.
Where we cannot offer you a suitable product, third party aggregators and panel providers with whom we work may be provided with your Personal Information so that a suitable product from a range of third party providers e.g. our annuities panel, can be found. The third party providers use their own automated processes in order to make decisions about your needs and your risk profile to determine if they wish to offer you a product. In such circumstances you will also need to consult the privacy notices of those third parties which will apply to how they hold your Personal Information.
We make use of automated tools that help us to understand your risk profile within our advice process. Our risk profile questionnaires are automated and allow us to establish your risk tolerance and attitude to risk. This helps our advisers, in line with our regulatory requirements, to make appropriate recommendations based on your risk attitude, as well as assist with identifying any issues, e.g. vulnerabilities and affordability. We do not use these tools to make automated decisions about you. Our advisers validate the outcome of the risk analysis with you, to explain the score in line with the adviser’s previous experience and knowledge. We will then contact you to check your responses in order to give advice that is tailored to you. This also assists with ensuring that advisers are working to agreed standards and for the overall purpose of ensuring we act prudently when advising on risk in line with our regulatory requirements.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision.  In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
6. Profiling and Data Analysis
We use profiling and other data analysis to build, train and audit our insurance models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
) and our machine-learning tools. The models, algorithms and tools we use help us do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them, whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us; and
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
We may also use profiling and data analysis for other reasons e.g. to ensure data quality and accuracy and to help us improve our business.
The purpose of this analysis is not to make decisions about you directly, but your Personal Information, in combination with Personal Information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties, will be used to conduct data analysis so that we can improve our processes, our products and services and check the way our models, algorithms and machine-learning tools work. The Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us may be used for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information in order to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name, and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
We also use profiling in relation to marketing. For further information please see Marketing.
7. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
8. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
9. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
10. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.

our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.

Automated decision making and profiling
Show
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:

based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
Show
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

5. What does Aviva use my personal information for?
To provide the service
You need to provide us and our Aviva Save Platform partners with your personal data if you want to access and use the Aviva Save Platform. If you decide not to provide us with the personal data that we request from you then we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter with you, meaning you may not be able to access and use the Aviva Save Platform. In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
The protection of your privacy is very important to us, as such Aviva only collects and uses a limited amount of personal data in connection with your use of the Aviva Save Platform, this includes for the purposes of:
Creating and managing your Aviva Save Account;
Sharing data with platform partners to facilitate your transactions and investments; and
Managing queries and complaints when you contact us.
To improve our services
Conduct research and analysis of users' behaviour to improve our services and content (for instance, we may decide to change the "look and feel" or even substantially modify a given feature based on users' behaviour);
Develop new features and services (for example, we may decide to build a new interests-based feature further to requests received from users);
Analyse your choices within Aviva Save so we can understand what other Aviva products and services are relevant to you; and
To conduct surveys and other research about our products and services.
To prevent, detect and fight fraud or other illegal or unauthorised activities
We perform personal information analysis to better understand and design countermeasures against these activities and retain personal information related to fraudulent activities to prevent against recurrences.
To ensure legal compliance
To comply with legal requirements, assist law enforcement and enforce or exercise our rights, for example our Aviva Save Terms and Conditions.
For financial crime purposes
We may receive customer personal data if, when applying for the Aviva Save Account, the customer fails a financial crime check or process. In this scenario, Aviva may request the customer's personal data solely for the purpose of auditing of financial crime processes and controls performed by Raisin (and its platform partners if applicable), and the associated results of such processes and controls. In particular, Aviva may want to make sure that: (i) adequate financial crime controls and processes are adhered to by Raisin; (ii) processes are completed to resolve the customer outcome of the applicable financial crime check or process; and (iii) the result of the customer outcome of the applicable financial crime check or process is in line with Aviva's expectation or Aviva's understanding of the customer if such customer already holds other products with Aviva.
Marketing Purposes
We may use your personal data to send direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you'll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group, as well as communications about promotions and prize draws. You can find out more information about some of the different companies in the Aviva Group here:

Social media and online platforms

If we use or share personal data with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as: contact data, ID data, age, gender, behavioural and product data. This allows us to determine the most relevant products, services, offers and benefits to send you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
6. What are Aviva's legal bases for processing my personal data?
Processing is necessary to perform a contract we have entered with you and/or for taking steps to comply with a request made by an individual with a view to entering into a contract (Article 6(1)(b) of the UK GDPR). By way of example:
we process your personal data when you provide us with pre-contractual information at the point of registering with us. This allows us to carry out our obligations to provide services to you under the Aviva Save Platform contract and also so we can carry out other relevant required activities.
Processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller (Article 6 (1)(c) of the UK GDPR).
we may process personal data, solely or combination with Aviva Save platform partners for the purpose of fulfilling various legal obligations such as carrying out obligations in respect of the provision of your savings products and the provision of our online services, verification of your identity and making financial risk assessments including anti-money laundering checks and the use of your personal data for crime and fraud prevention purposes.
Legitimate interests (Article 6 (1)(f) of the UK GDPR)
Circumstances may arise where we or a third party may need to process your personal data beyond the performance of our contract to protect our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party. This processing could include:
testing and optimisation of requirements analysis and direct customer approach;
measures to manage the business (including adjustments to pricing and our commercial models);
to improve services and to recover customers and advertising or marketing and opinion research;
for the purposes of marketing;
processing your personal data to ensure content from the Aviva Save Platform is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device;
to meet our regulatory compliance, fraud detection and reporting obligations, enforce any of our rights against you and to pursue other legal purposes;
developing and improving our services to you and notifying you about changes to our services.
Consent (Article 6 (1)(a) of the UK GDPR)
We may ask for your consent to use your personal information for certain specific reasons.
Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your personal data. Please contact us using the details below if you need details about the specific legal ground, we are relying on to process your personal data.
7. Who does Aviva share your personal data with and why?
We will never sell, trade, or rent your personal data to others; however, we may share your personal data with selected third parties in the following instances:
With our service providers and partners
We use third parties in order to provide savings products, to carry out marketing and research and to manage your Aviva Save Account. For more information about how our Aviva Save partners process your data see the "
Our relationship with third parties
" section above.
With other Aviva Group businesses
We may disclose your information to any member of the Aviva Group including in connection with the financial crime purposes outlined earlier in this policy. This means if we receive information relating to failed checks, we may disclose this information to our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as necessary to review and update our wider group practices in this area. We may also share your personal data with certain Aviva Group Companies who are involved in our customer relationship management, marketing, compliance and support. The Aviva Group ensures the protection of any personal data shared within the Aviva Group through data sharing agreements.

In corporate transactions
We may transfer your personal information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganisation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.
When required by law
We are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation, as part of legal proceedings, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions which apply to your savings products or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Aviva, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
To enforce legal rights
We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
We require all third-party service providers, to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. When you use Aviva Save, you will contract directly with our Service Bank, and our partner banks where you purchase or use their products. In such instances these parties may also process your personal data for their own purposes in accordance with their privacy policies (see "
Our Relationship with third parties
") above.
8. How to complain
If you have a query or complaint about how we process your personal data, please contact us using the contact details below. We will investigate your concerns and take all reasonable steps to resolve the matter promptly.
If you're not happy with the way we're handling your personal data, you have a right to make a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the ICO. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance. You can contact the ICO through their website:

9. How does Aviva send information outside of my country?
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer personal data outside of the UK. We'll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of personal data outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of protection for your personal data (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please contact us.
10. Your data protection rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have:
Right of access
Show
You can request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and further information about how we process your personal data. This is known as a ‘Data Subject Access Request', and we normally have one month to respond to such a request. You can make a Data Subject Access Request by contacting the Data Protection Officer. A Data Subject Access Request will usually be free of charge. We will ask you to provide forms of identification accepted by Aviva so we can verify your identity before we can respond to a Data Subject Access Request. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask for further information in relation to your request to ensure we fully understand the information requested.
Right to rectification
Show
If your information is no longer correct you have the right to request that we rectify it. We take reasonable steps to keep your information accurate, complete and current. Please remember that it is your responsibility to tell us about any updates to your information. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us. You may also edit your details at any time by logging into your Aviva Save Account or by contacting our Customer Services team by phone on
0345 301 2029
or by email to
avivasave@aviva.com
.
Right to erasure
Show
In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to delete your personal data, for example; if your personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose(s) it was collected for, or your personal data has been processed unlawfully. There are legitimate reasons that we must retain some of your personal data after you have requested its deletion, including compliance with legal or regulatory obligations to which we are subject, or for the establishment, exercise of defence of legal claims. We will notify you of any decision to retain or erase your personal data.
Right to restrict processing
Show
You can request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in specific circumstances. Where a restriction is in place, we can continue to store your information, but we will only process it with your consent, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, to protect the rights of another individual or legal entity or for important public interest reasons. We will inform you prior to the lifting of any restriction.
Right to object
Show
You can request that we stop processing your personal data where the purpose(s) is based on a ‘legitimate business interest' and/or the ‘public interest'. We can continue to process your personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or if we are satisfied there are compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights or freedoms.
Right to data portability
Show
You have the right to request that we provide your personal data to you in a portable format and also upon request to transmit your personal data to another data controller. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Right to withdraw consent
Show
If we have asked for your consent to use your personal data, you are free to withdraw your consent at any time. If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.
Rights related to automated decision making including profiling
Show
Aviva does not use automated decision making in the course of its business relationship as referred to in Article 22 of the UK GDPR. Our Aviva Save partners processes your personal data by partially automated means to evaluate certain personal aspects (profiling) and to be able to provide the best possible service to you. Please see their respective privacy notices for additional information.
You can exercise your rights at any time by contacting us using the contact details above.
We respond to all requests we receive from users in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. In some cases, we may reject requests for certain reasons (for example, if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user).
11. How does Aviva protect my personal data
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. We have also ensured our Aviva Save platform partners are committed to similar security standards.
12. How long does Aviva retain my personal data?
Your personal data will be stored in accordance with applicable laws and kept for as long as needed to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by applicable law.
We do keep certain transactional records - which may include personal information - for more extended periods if we need to do this to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For instance, we're required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We'll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation.
We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to the records we hold.
We may also retain personal information where we have identified a legal basis for doing so in an aggregated form which allows us to continue to develop/improve our products and services.
13. Third-party links
The Aviva Save Platform may include links to third-party websites. If it is not obviously recognisable, we will explicitly point out when such links are to third-party websites. Clicking on those links may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave the Aviva Save Platform, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.
14. Updates to this policy
This privacy policy is updated from time to time to take account of changes in our business activities, legal requirements and to make sure it's as transparent as possible, so please check back here for the current version. You can see when this privacy policy was last updated by checking below.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our insurance policies. Certain insurance policies have specific privacy policies, found on our
landing page
which you should review instead of this one, if your insurance policy is related to motor, home, travel, commercial, personal accident, health or protection.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Where you are an individual policyholder, the Aviva group company that underwrites your insurance policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
We have separate privacy notices for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy notice. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy (or individuals where it’s taken out jointly or otherwise for the benefit of others). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example, if you ask us to provide insurance for someone other than you e.g. other household or family members.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime, including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess if your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information or criminal data. See
Automated Decision Making
for further details.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes the
Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared between insurers.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details
contact us
.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
When you purchase a policy from Aviva, we may undertake some checks with a credit reference agency. The checks that we do will depend on how you bought your policy and whether we offer an Aviva credit payment facility. When you buy your policy, you will be informed about these assessments before we do them.
Where you purchase your policy directly with Aviva or through an intermediary (e.g. a broker or an Aviva business partner), and if it is a policy with which we will assess whether we can offer you with an Aviva credit payment facility, we will undertake a number of checks, outlined in detail below.
We or our agents may:
undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims; and
carry out a quotation search from a credit reference agency. We do this so that we are able to offer monthly credit payment options.
We use data from a credit reference agency to verify your identity, prevent fraud and carry out risk profiling which allows us to calculate your premium and payment options. We may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested.
As part of our regulatory obligations, before we offer you your payment options, we will carry out an affordability assessment. We do this using information from a credit reference agency including an over-indebtedness score and some of the underlying data used to calculate this score. The credit reference agency calculates your over-indebtedness score using information it holds about your existing credit commitments and modelled information relating to income and living expenses. We will use your over-indebtedness score to help assess whether additional credit could cause you financial harm. We will do this when you request a quote and at renewal so that we can decide whether to offer you a monthly credit payment option.
The quotation and affordability searches will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear it is part of a quote and not a credit application by you. Where you agree to pay monthly under an Aviva credit agreement, the status of your quote search will be updated to reflect your credit application and this will be visible to other credit providers.
In order to carry out these searches we will supply your Personal Information to credit reference agencies and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness (including affordability) and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will also continue to exchange information about you with credit reference agencies on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. credit reference agencies will share your information with other organisations. Your Personal Information will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associates.
The credit reference agency we use is TransUnion. More information about the ways in which TransUnion uses and shares Personal Information can be found on the
TransUnion website
.
Where you purchase your policy through an intermediary (e.g. a broker or an Aviva business partner), if it is a policy with which we do not offer an Aviva credit payment facility, the following checks will be undertaken:
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. We or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion
website.
6. Automated Decision Making
We may use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy, the price, and whether we can provide you with a monthly credit payment option.
Your personalised price may be presented to you in suitable marketing communications, including those sent from price comparison websites or third party partners with whom you have a relationship.
We also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see
Data Rights
.
7. Profiling and Data Analysis
We use profiling and other data analysis to build, train and audit our insurance models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
) and our machine-learning tools. The models, algorithms and tools we use help us do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them, whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us; and
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
We may also use profiling and data analysis for other reasons e.g. to ensure data quality and accuracy and to help us improve our business.
The purpose of this analysis is not to make decisions about you directly, but your Personal Information, in combination with Personal Information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties, will be used to conduct data analysis so that we can improve our processes, our products and services and check the way our models, algorithms and machine-learning tools work.The Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us may be used for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information in order to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name, and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
We also use profiling in relation to marketing. For further information please see
Marketing
.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
10. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
11. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information

it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.
This isn’t an absolute right and we have to balance your request against other factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, which may mean we cannot erase your Personal Information.
Restricting processing of your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.

we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.
Right to object
Show
You can object if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us.
You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
Show
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
Show
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals in relation to our private client insurance policies.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies in the United Kingdom and Ireland. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
The Aviva group company that underwrites your insurance policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal Information, known as the controller. Risks situated in the United Kingdom or another non-EEA country (not including the Principality of Monaco) are underwritten by Aviva Insurance Limited. Risks situated in the EEA and the Principality of Monaco are underwritten by Aviva Insurance Ireland Designated Activity Company.
We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group. Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For information about Aviva please visit the
Aviva website
.
A third party company (or companies) may underwrite aspects of your insurance policy and will also be acting as controller(s) of your Personal Information. Please check the documentation that we provide to you for details of the other company(ies). If you want to know more about the controller(s) of your Personal Information, please contact us using the details below.
We have separate privacy policies for our different types of products, so if you have a number of Aviva products you may need to review more than one privacy policy. We may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
Most of the Personal Information we collect relates to the individual who is taking out a policy (or other individuals, where it’s taken out jointly or otherwise for the benefit of others). We may also ask for Personal Information about other individuals if we need it. For example, if you ask us to provide insurance for someone other than you, such as family members or employees. If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

Lawful Bases for uses of Personal Information
Show
We are committed to collecting and using Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws. By law, we must have a legal justification, known as a lawful basis, in order to use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Depending upon the purpose, our lawful basis will be one of the following:
Performance of a contract – to arrange, underwrite or manage our products, or handle claims in accordance with their terms;
Compliance with a legal obligation – to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or other legal responsibilities;
Legitimate interests – to operate and improve our products and services and keep people informed about our products and services or for any other purposes we identify as appropriate to our business needs, or those business needs of a third party;
Consent – where we have obtained appropriate consents to collect or use your Personal Information for a particular purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual. The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether we can use your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests, the interests being relied upon will usually be:
To further our business and commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party, e.g. to provide our products and services and produce management information on our performance and the performance of third parties;
To help us better understand our customers and improve our customer engagement, including by carrying out analysis and profiling, e.g. by making certain predictions and assumptions about your interests;
To provide you with helpful information relating to your products and about useful tools for managing and engaging with your products. These are not marketing communications;
To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, guidelines, standards and codes of conduct, e.g. background checks and the prevention, detection and investigation of financial crime or fraud;
To improve and develop our business, products and services, or those of a third party, e.g. to ensure the accuracy of customer data and to develop our pricing and risk methods and models;
To retain your policy record for a period of time in order to ensure we have appropriate records in place in respect of any future claims that may be insured by us;
To safeguard our business, shareholders, employees and customers, or a third party, e.g. maintaining the security of our IT network and information, enforcing claims, including debt collection;
To facilitate the purchase, sale, transfer or disposal of any part of our business; and
To analyse and assess competition in the market for our products and services, e.g. by carrying out market research.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information and Personal Information about other individuals associated with your policy, to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime, including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
If you’re making an application or a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your application or claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information or criminal data. For example, we may use your past motoring convictions for motoring insurance or details of any convictions relating to fraud or dishonesty. See
Automated Decision Making
for further details.
We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us detect fraud committed by brokers or financial advisers or to identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and other financial crime, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information-sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes National Sira administered by Synectics Solutions Limited (as joint data controller together with contributing companies, including Aviva),
Experian whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
and
the IFB whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA, ELTO, CBI, MIB and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services, e.g. paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering. This may be shared between insurers and with fraud prevention agencies and databases.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details, please contact us using the details below.
For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA please visit
https://dvla.gov.uk/
(in relation to motor insurance, UK domiciled customers only).
How your Personal Information is used and shared by insurers and databases in relation to motor and home insurance (UK domiciled customers only)
The Personal Information you provide will be used by us and shared with other insurers as well as certain statutory and other authorised bodies for:
Insurance underwriting purposes, i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
consider whether to accept the relevant risk;
make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance and related services for you (and members of your household);
validate your (or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim) claims history (at any time including upon application for insurance, in the event of an accident, incident or a claim, or a mid-term adjustment, or at a time of renewal).
Management information purposes. To analyse insurance and other markets for the purposes of:
portfolio assessment;
risk assessment;
performance reporting;
management reporting.
Anti-Fraud purposes. To detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by:
sharing information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
tracing debtors or beneficiaries, recovering debt, managing your accounts and/or insurance policies;
undertaking fraud searches. Insurers pass information to fraud prevention agencies and databases including National Sira, the CUE Register and where appropriate the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register by MIB. This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers. Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.
Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities, including:
claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim, e.g. third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims and conviction history;
complaints management – If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaint, including your Personal Information, to the relevant ombudsman.
in relation to motor insurance, information about your insurance policy will be added to the MID managed by the MIB. MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the police, the DVLA, the DVA, the IFB and other bodies permitted by law. This information may be used for purposes permitted by law, which include:
electronic licensing;
continuous insurance enforcement;
law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders);
the provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.
If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the European Economic Area or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.
Individuals who may be citizens of other countries or their appointed representatives making a claim in respect of a road traffic accident may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds your current registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the police and/or a fixed penalty notice.
You can check that your current registration number details are shown on the MID at
https://www.askmid.com/
How your Personal Information will be processed (in relation to motor insurance, UK domiciled customers only)
Information which is supplied to fraud prevention agencies and databases, e.g. National Sira, MIB and MID can include details like your name, address and date of birth.
Your data may be supplied to databases in order to facilitate automatic no claim discount validation checks.
Your data may be transferred to any country, including countries outside of the UK and European Economic Area, for any of the purposes mentioned above.
Under your policy you must tell us about any incident (e.g. an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the fraud prevention agencies and databases, e.g. MIB.
You can ask for more information about this. If you require such information, please contact us using the details below.
How we use your Driving Licence Number (in relation to motor insurance, UK domiciled customers only)
We collect your Driving Licence Number (DLN) for insurance underwriting purposes, i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
Provide your (or any person included on the proposal) DLN to the DVLA to confirm your (or the relevant person included on the proposal) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out prior to the date of the insurance policy and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy including at the mid-term adjustment and renewal stage. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence.
Searches may be carried out at point of quote and, if an insurance policy is incepted, if any changes are made mid-term, and at renewal stage.
Please note that if you give us false or inaccurate information it may invalidate your insurance policy/prospective insurance policy or it could affect the amount we pay to settle any claims you make under the policy.
5. Credit Reference Agencies
To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may need to obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. We or our agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (e.g. the electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossession(s)). Similar checks may be made when assessing claims.
Information about the credit reference agency we use and the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, are explained in more detail on the
TransUnion
website.
6. Automated Decision Making
We may use automated processes to make decisions. These automated processes use data provided by you, other records we hold about you in our systems and data sourced from third parties to make predictions, including the likelihood that a claim will be made and its value, the likelihood a product will be purchased and the likelihood that a claim might be fraudulent. This helps us to determine eligibility for a policy, the terms of the policy, the price, and whether we can provide you with a monthly credit payment option.
In relation to home insurance only, in order to provide you with a price for your policy, the following steps may be taken:
Information about you:
The first step is that we know who you are and what you are looking to have insured, e.g. details about your property.
We enrich the information:
We carry out checks to validate your information (e.g. confirming your identity) and enrich it with data from third party sources. Information on the third party data sources we use is set out above in
Types of Personal Information collected
. For example, we use your address to source additional information on the area you live in, such as the distance of your property from a fire station.
We calculate your insurance risk:
We use statistical modelling techniques to assess the information in order to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made and the likely severity of a claim. This assessment is based on various factors including information about the area you live in such as the likelihood of crime. For example, if you live in an area with high property crime this may lead to a higher premium. All insurers will use different weightings to price insurance and this is confidential to each insurer.
Provision of the final price:
Once we have a view of your insurance risk we can provide you with a final price, which will include any commission payments and applicable tax.
We may also make automated decisions throughout the life of your policy, e.g. before offering you a renewal or when dealing with a claim.
Where we make an automated decision using Personal Information which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have certain rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive meaningful information about the logic involved in relation to the decision, the right to human intervention and the right to obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it. For more information about this right and how to exercise it please see the section on
Data Rights
below.
7. Profiling and Data Analysis
We use profiling and other data analysis to build, train and audit insurance models and algorithms (including those used in our
Automated Decision Making
) and our machine-learning tools. The models, algorithms and tools we use help us do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g. how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them, whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing claims e.g. determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our services e.g. looking at how to prevent complaints; and
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out checks, including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules, and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
One technique we may use is natural language processing. Natural language processing is a machine learning tool that involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this tool to help us with the purposes listed above e.g. we may use it to assess how you are feeling about Aviva based on the words that you use to communicate with us.
We may also use profiling and data analysis for other reasons, e.g.to ensure data quality and accuracy and to help us improve our business.
The purpose of this analysis is not to make decisions about you directly, but your Personal Information, in combination with Personal Information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties, will be used to conduct data analysis so that we can improve our processes, our products and services and check the way our models, algorithms and machine-learning tools work. The Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us may be used for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information in order to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name, and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
8. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
9. International Data Transfers for Private Clients
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK or European Economic Area (EEA). We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK or EEA is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK or EEA considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
using the details below.
10. Data Rights for Private Clients
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allows us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please contact us using the details below.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us for a copy of your Personal Information together with specified details about how we use your information. This is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’.

Erasing your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to erase your Personal Information, but this right only applies in certain circumstances, e.g. where:
it is no longer necessary for us to use your Personal Information for the original purpose;
our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.
This isn’t an absolute right and we have to balance your request against other factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, which may mean we cannot erase your Personal Information.
Restricting processing of your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.
This isn’t an absolute right and we may not be able to comply with your request.
Data portability
Show
In some cases, you can ask us to transfer Personal Information that you have provided to us to another third party of your choice. This right only applies where:
we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.
Right to object
Show
You can object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
Show
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
Show
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains
how we use Personal Information
which we collect about individuals who are not customers, prospective customers, beneficiaries, or prospective beneficiaries of Aviva products and services, but whose Personal Information we process in connection with those products and services, e.g:
Third party claimants;
Witnesses to an incident;
Individuals who have caused a policyholder a loss and whom Aviva have a right to pursue in order to recover those losses;
Executors of wills;
Legal representatives, e.g. where a power of attorney has been granted by an individual;
General practitioners and other medical or similar professionals;
Expert witnesses or other expert service providers;
Legal advisers and claims handlers;
Brokers, appointed representatives and other business partners;
Contact persons at corporate clients;
Participants in market research, promotions and prize draws.
We also have arrangements with some insurers based outside the UK to assist them with the processing of any claims against their insurance products in relation to incidents which happen in the UK or involve UK residents overseas. We have referred to these overseas insurers as our “overseas insurance partners” in this Privacy Policy. In providing this service to our overseas insurance partners, in addition to processing Personal Information concerning the categories of individuals above, we may also process Personal Information about policyholders of our overseas insurance partners.
We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, organisational and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information in line with our obligations under data protection law. Our employees receive training to help us comply with data protection law and safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva group that processes your Personal Information.
Each Aviva group company that processes your Personal Information is responsible for looking after it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your relationship with us will determine which of our group companies are the data controller(s) responsible for your Personal Information. Please check the documentation that we provide to you to see the specific Aviva company acting as controller of your Personal Information. If you are unsure, please
contact us
. We may share your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy with other companies in the Aviva group (including Wealthify Limited).
Depending upon our relationship with you, we may also supplement this Privacy Policy with additional privacy notices tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information.
If you provide us with Personal Information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission, where required. We’ll process their Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.

Lawful Bases for uses of Personal Information
Show
We are committed to collecting and using Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Consent – where we have obtained appropriate consents to collect or use your Personal Information for a particular purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis, we are required to carry out a balancing test to ensure that our interests, or those of a third party, do not override the rights and freedoms that you have as an individual.

4. Fraud and Other Financial Crime
We use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud and other financial crime, including to meet our statutory and regulatory responsibilities in relation to fraud and financial crime.
If you’re making a claim, we may use profiling and other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your claim may be fraudulent. This assessment may involve the use of Sensitive Personal Information. For example, we may use your past motoring convictions if you are making a motor claim.
We use Personal Information, including Sensitive Personal Information, to help us detect and investigate fraud committed by third parties, e.g. witnesses, brokers, financial advisers, other intermediaries, solicitors and medical experts. We may also use your Personal Information including details of our interactions with you to help us identify where you or a third party may be at risk of fraud or other financial crime.
To prevent, detect and investigate fraud, we:
check public registers (e.g. the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions);
conduct online searches from websites, social media and other information-sharing platforms;
use databases managed by credit reference agencies, insurance industry bodies, fraud detection agencies and other reputable organisations. This includes National Sira administered by Synectics Solutions Limited (as joint data controller together with contributing companies, including Aviva),
Experian whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
and the
Insurance Fraud Bureau whose Privacy Policy can be viewed here
; and
share Personal Information and undertake searches with other third parties, including other insurers, fraud prevention agencies, law enforcement agencies, public bodies and our regulators (which include the FCA, PRA and ICO).
This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services such as paying claims and trace debtors or beneficiaries.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering and this may be shared between insurers.
We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details, please
contact us
.
For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA

This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers.
Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities, including:
Claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim, e.g. third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims and conviction history;
Complaints management – If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaints, including your Personal Information, to the relevant ombudsman;
Information about your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the MIB. MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the police, the DVLA, the DVA, the IFB and other bodies permitted by law. This information may be used for purposes permitted by law, which include:
Electronic Licensing;
Continuous insurance enforcement;
Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders);
The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.
If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the European Economic Area or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.
Individuals who may be citizens of other countries or their appointed representatives making a claim in respect of a road traffic accident may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds your current registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the police and/or a fixed penalty notice.
You can check that your current registration number with the
MID
.
How your Personal Information will be processed
Information which is supplied to fraud prevention agencies and databases, e.g. MIB and MID can include details like your name, address and date of birth.
Your data may be supplied to databases in order to facilitate automatic no claim discount validation checks.
Your data may be transferred to any country, including countries outside of the European Economic Area, for any of the purposes mentioned above.
Under your policy you must tell us about any incident (e.g. an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the fraud prevention agencies and databases, e.g. MIB.
You can ask for more information about this. If you require such information, please
contact us
.
How we use your Driving Licence Number
Insurance underwriting purposes i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
Provide your (or any person included on the proposal) Driving Licence Number (DLN) to the DVLA to confirm your (or the relevant person included on the proposal) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out prior to the date of the insurance policy and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy including at the mid-term adjustment and renewal stage. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence;
Searches may be carried out at point of quote and, if an insurance policy is incepted, if any changes are made mid-term, and at renewal stage.
Please note that if you give us false or inaccurate information it may invalidate your insurance policy/prospective insurance policy or it could affect the amount we pay to settle any claims you make.
How your data is used and shared by Insurers and Databases in relation to household insurance
Show
The data you provide will be used by us and shared with other insurers as well as certain statutory and other authorised bodies for:
Insurance underwriting purposes, i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:
consider whether to accept the relevant risk;
make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance and related services for you and members of your household;
validate your (or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim) claims history (at any time, including upon application for insurance, in the event of an incident or a claim, or mid-term adjustment, or at a time of renewal).
Management information purposes, i.e. to analyse insurance and other markets for the purposes of:
portfolio assessment;
risk assessment;
performance reporting;
management reporting.
Anti-fraud purposes i.e. to detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by:
sharing information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
tracing debtors or beneficiaries, recovering debt, managing your accounts and/or insurance policies;
undertaking fraud searches. Insurers pass information to the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register administered by Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers.
Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities, including:
Claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim, e.g. third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims history;
Complaints management - If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaint, including your Personal Information, to the relevant ombudsman.
5. Profiling, Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence
We process Personal Information to perform profiling and data analysis to build, train and audit insurance and third party models and algorithms.
We also use artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Artificial intelligence is a machine’s ability to perform tasks we associate with humans. For example, problem solving, learning and decision making. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches machines to learn and interpret from information and then provide a response. One type of artificial intelligence that we use is natural language processing. Natural language processing involves reading, understanding and analysing speech and text. We may use this to help us with the purposes listed below.
The models, algorithms, and tools we use do a number of things including:
understanding our customers and potential customers better, e.g., how they feel about Aviva, what kind of content or products would be of most use and interest to them (for further information please see
Marketing
, whether they might be displaying characteristics meaning that they may require additional support from us;
managing claims e.g. determining liability, valuing claims;
monitoring and improving our processes and services e.g. by generating summaries of claims notes, looking how to prevent complaints;
predicting the likelihood of events arising to assess insurance risk, the likelihood a product will be purchased or to predict if a claim might be fraudulent; and
ensuring data quality and accuracy e.g. checking the way our models, algorithms and machine learning tools work.
To carry out these purposes we may combine your Personal Information with information relating to other customers, potential customers and/or data provided by third parties. We may also use the Personal Information you submitted to obtain a quote from us for this analysis whether or not you decided to purchase the product.
We use a number of data items as described in this Privacy Policy for these purposes. Before we use any such data, we carry out a number of checks including ensuring there are no legal restrictions on using the data under data protection laws, the Equality Act 2010 or under FCA rules and we consider whether use of the data might cause outcomes that are unfairly or unlawfully biased. We then use statistical modelling techniques to assess the data to ensure that the data tells us something meaningful. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who provide us with new data which we will test to understand if such new data provides additional understanding.
Where possible, we pseudonymise the Personal Information to perform this analysis. This means that we remove information from which you can be directly identified, e.g. your name and replace it with a pseudonym or unique identifier. We do this to maximise the security of your information.
6. Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep records – which may include Personal Information – to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For example, we are required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation. The specific retention period for your Personal Information will depend on your relationship with us and the reasons we hold your Personal Information.
To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data retention and deletion.
If you would like more information about our data retention policy, please
contact us
.
7. International Data Transfers
Sometimes we, or third parties acting on our behalf, may need to transfer Personal Information outside of the UK. We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of Personal Information outside the UK is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. This might include transfers to countries that the UK considers will provide adequate levels of data protection for your Personal Information (such as countries in the European Economic Area) or putting contractual obligations in place with the party we are sending information to. Transfers within the Aviva group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group.
For more information about data transfers and the safeguards we have put in place, please
contact us
.
8. Marketing
We may use Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may include marketing relating to products offered by other brands or companies within the Aviva group (such as quotemehappy, Wealthify and Succession Wealth) as well as communications about promotions and prize draws.
Marketing communications may be sent by email, post, SMS, telephone and push notification. You may also see display advertising on websites, mobile applications, social media, television or in online search results.
You have control over our use of your Personal Information in relation to marketing communications. You can:
‘Opt out’ of receiving direct marketing. When you register with us, request an online quote, or purchase a product or service you will be given the opportunity to opt out. In addition, our email, post, SMS and telephone marketing communications include information to help you manage your marketing preferences;
Change your marketing preferences at any time by e-mailing us at
contactus@aviva.com
or writing to us at Aviva, Freepost, Mailing Exclusion Team, Unit 5, Wanlip Road Ind Est, Syston, Leicester, LE7 1PD. If you are registered for MyAviva you can change your marketing preferences at any time from within your account.
Please note that opting out of one type of marketing, e.g. by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you will be opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing.
We try to limit marketing and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on Personal Information we have about you and profiling that we have carried out (further details can be found under the sub-heading ‘Marketing profiles’ below). We may use information provided by third parties to send you direct marketing and we may use your Personal Information to send other people direct marketing, e.g. people you live with.
Please remember that if you opt out of receiving marketing, we will still send you communications relating to your products. If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you may still see generic advertising displayed online and in MyAviva, it just might not be as relevant to you.
Cookies and similar technologies
We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website or pixels within emails) to collect information about you. This technology is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.
For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website and how to manage cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Social media and online platforms
We share Personal Information with media agencies and social media and other online platforms to help us target our online marketing. Social media and other online platforms may also use Personal Information they hold and combine it with Personal Information received from us to create target audiences. These are audiences that we think would be interested in our online advertising. This may involve social media and other online platforms building a ‘lookalike’ profile of the type of person we are trying to target and providing specific adverts to those people when they browse the internet or use social media.
If we use or share Personal Information with third parties in order to send you direct marketing, we will respect the marketing preferences you have set. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and any online platforms and smart devices you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.
Marketing profiles
We use automated processes to help us provide more personalised marketing of our products. To do this, our automated process creates a marketing profile for you using information such as:
identification data;
behavioural data (e.g. data relating to your use of our website);
your gender and age;
contact data;
status data (e.g. number of children in household);
product related data (e.g. policy identifiers, renewal dates);
details of our interactions with you;
device and vehicle-related data.
Our process analyses this data to determine the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and to decide the appropriate time and channel for offering them to you.
Information obtained in relation to one product may be used in relation to marketing other products from the Aviva group.
We may also create profiles using your Personal Information together with information relating to other individuals, we use these profiles to decide what marketing may be of interest to individuals with similar characteristics to you.
Promotions and prize draws
We occasionally run promotions and prize draws for our customers and third parties. Our communications to you about these promotions before you enter them are marketing. If you opt out of receiving direct marketing, you will not receive communications about promotions and prize draws.
We may use your Personal Information to select you as a winner, inform you of promotion outcomes and send prizes to your nominated address. We may use third party fulfilment partners to assist us in administering promotions, including contacting you on our behalf. In accordance with the rules of the Advertising Standards Authority, we may publish or make publicly available information that indicates that a valid award has taken place. If we do this, only your surname, country and, if applicable, your winning entry, will be published. You have the right to object to this use of your Personal Information.
9. Data Rights
You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Read below to learn more about each right you may have.
We may ask you for proof of identity when you make a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information to the right individual.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. We may also ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked. This is because your rights will not always apply, e.g. if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if the law allow us to deal with the request in a different way. We will always explain to you how we are dealing with your request. In some circumstances (such as the right to erasure or withdrawal of consent), exercising a right might mean that we can no longer provide our product to you.
For further information about or to exercise any of your rights, please
contact us
. If you wish to make a subject access request, please
fill out this form
.
Your rights are as follows:
Access to your Personal Information

our lawful basis for using your Personal Information is consent and you withdraw your consent; or
our lawful basis is legitimate interests and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue using your Personal Information if you object.

Restricting processing of your Personal Information
Show
You may ask us to stop using your Personal Information in certain circumstances such as:
where you have contacted us about the accuracy of your Personal Information and we are checking the accuracy;
if you have objected to your Personal Information being used based on legitimate interests.

Right to object
Show

You may also object where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the lawful basis we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so.
Automated decision making and profiling
Show
You have the right not to be subject to a decision using your Personal Information which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. This right does not apply if the decision is:
necessary for the purposes of a contract between us and you;
authorised by law (e.g. to prevent fraud); or
based on your explicit consent.
You do however have a right to request human intervention, express your view and challenge the decision.
Withdrawing consent
Show
In some circumstances we ask for your consent to use your Personal Information. You are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
If it is the case that we need your consent to provide you with a particular product and you wish to withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide our product to you. Where that is the case, we will inform you before taking any action.
