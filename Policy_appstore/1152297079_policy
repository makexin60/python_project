NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (Shine the Light Disclosure)

Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as we do, by disclosing in its privacy policy that we provide consumers with a choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties and affiliates for those third parties’ and affiliates’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. At this time, we do not share personally identifiable information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. If we do so in the future, we will provide you with a choice prior to sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time we offer that choice, we will not share your information with that identified third party or affiliate for its direct marketing purposes.

We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site.

We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Our Services are not directed to individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.

When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), in some instances, including when delivering services to you, it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside the EEA/UK. In such situations we only transfer your personal data to a country or international organisation outside the UK/EEA where there is an adequate level of protection of personal data; there are appropriate safeguards in place together with enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects; or a specific exception applies under data protection law. Where there is no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, we may transfer your personal data to a third country where an exception applies under data protection law.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy and where appropriate we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the log-in screen or sending you an email notification). Your continued use of our Services after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to the current version of this Policy. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, do not use any Websites and Service.
