A. Privacy Policy
Introduction
Selfridges is more than a shop. It is a landmark destination and social centre where everyone is welcome.  Even before we opened the doors to our Oxford Street store in 1909, our founder, Harry Gordon Selfridge, recognised the importance of placing our customers at the heart of everything we do. The foundations he laid continue to guide us and form a key element of our commitment to protecting your personal information.
Our Privacy Policy gives you information about when and why we collect your personal information, how we use it and how we keep it secure. Please note that this Policy only applies to personal information that Selfridges uses.  It does not cover the use of your personal information by third parties, who are not processing your information on our behalf, for example if you select other payment processing providers (
see below
for more details). This Policy also tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.
In this Policy, we refer to our stores, website (selfridges.com), microsites (e.g., selfridgesrental.com and app) as the “Sites” and our in-store and online services (e.g., personal shopping, alterations, safe deposit boxes) as “Services” for ease. Our Sites and Services are operated by or on behalf of Selfridges Retail Limited.
We recommend you that you read our
Terms & Conditions
in conjunction with this Policy.
Selfridges Retail Limited is the data controller responsible for your personal information and is registered at the UK Information Commissioner’s Office with registration number: Z455833X
How to contact us:
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or want to exercise your rights set out in this Privacy Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer at

Special category information (in exceptional circumstances and only where relevant e.g., if you are attending an event)
Religious beliefs, race, ethnic origin, languages spoken, skin tone, physical health (e.g., any disabilities and access requirements), allergies.
How we use your personal information
We use your personal information to carry on our business and to provide our Services, including processing transactions in store and online, sending our opted in customers marketing (e.g. Keyholders), conducting analytics, administering and carrying out customer checks related to your Safe Deposit box (including under a Safe Deposit box Signatory Confirmation Mandate, under power of attorney or other legal right of access, for example as an executor of an estate) where relevant, and providing services such as appointment bookings and events.
We will process your personal information under what’s known as a “lawful basis”. Generally, we process your personal information where we have a contract with you, where we have obtained your consent, where we have a genuine business interest (known as “legitimate interest”), or where we have a legal obligation to do so.
You can find out more about how we use your personal information and the lawful bases we rely on in the table below.
Where we have a contract with you
To fulfil and deliver (where applicable) products and services you have ordered, to facilitate other services that we provide such as beauty bookings, restaurant bookings, Selfridges Rental, and Reselfridges.
To process payments. We share your personal information with credit card companies and other payment processing providers in order to facilitate your transaction. These third parties will be responsible for the handling of your personal information for these purposes and their privacy policies set out how they will do this. An example of this is Worldpay who provide payment processing services for Selfridges. They are a data controller of your transactional data in order to process your payment. Worldpay’s Privacy Statement, which can be found on their corporate website, sets out how they use and handle your personal information.
To send you service-related communications and to contact you with important information about your purchase or booking. For example, confirming your order, letting you know about returns and refunds, and any information in relation to your transaction or Service.
Where we have your consent
To send you marketing by electronic means. For example, when you subscribe to Selfridges marketing you will automatically become a Selfridges Keyholder - you consent to us being able to send you marketing via channels such as email and our app, about all the latest news, events and offers at Selfridges. You will receive a personal QR code (known as your Selfridges Key). You can use your Selfridges Key to identify yourself in our Stores and to unlock certain perks.  As a Selfridges Keyholder, you will get to hear about exciting product launches and offers that are tailored to you and have access to a range of perks such as entry to The Big Win draw, early access to events, free delivery, and a charity donation every time you shop with your Selfridges Key.
Where we have collected your contact details in the process of a sale on our Sites, we may rely on “Soft opt in” for marketing by electronic means under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (“PECR”). This means that we will automatically opt you into marketing unless you choose to say “no” because we believe that you would be interested in hearing more about our products or services.
To tailor emails, internet, and in-app notifications to the things you love, so they’re relevant to your location, what you have shown an interest in, your online browsing behaviour and the things you buy from us. Depending on the nature and degree of personalisation involved, we may either do this under consent or where we have a legitimate interest.
To use and share your details to show you advertising on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, or via third-party advertising that may appear on other websites or apps you use. Online advertising channels we may use are digital display, video on demand, search engine marketing, and paid social - these are all on third party sites or platforms and you should review their privacy policies to make sure you understand how they use and handle your personal information.
To communicate with you about products or services. Our clienteling or personal shopping team members may communicate with you on a one-to-one basis through a third-party communication platform, such as WhatsApp, to let you know about exciting products or services that they believe you would be interested in.
Where we have a legitimate interest
To respond to customer service enquiries raised in the store, online, social media or on the phone.
To keep your customer record in our Customer Relationship Manager (CRM). We use Salesforce as our CRM provider.
To keep our CRM database accurate and relevant. We may do this, for example, using the National Change of Address database.
To invite you to provide product reviews and feedback about our products and services. We always want to ensure we are providing an exceptional customer experience and welcome the opportunity to improve the quality of our products and services. So, we may, from time to time, send customer surveys to you in the form of online, email, or in-store surveys. We use third-party service providers, such as Medallia and Yotpo, to assist us with product reviews, customer surveys and feedback requests.
To invite you to participate in user testing sessions, such as panel interviews, focus groups and observed testing. We often work with trusted third parties to conduct these sessions.
To send you abandoned basket emails. We use third party suppliers, such as Salesforce, to send our abandon basket emails. We send these to you to give you an easy way to come back and complete your purchase should you wish to.
To send you marketing by post. We share your personal information with a variety of third-party postal providers who assist us in delivering our postal campaigns to you.
To provide you with personalised advertising or recommendations to enhance your Selfridges experience on our Sites. We do this so we can make sure we’re providing our customers with products and Services that are most interesting and relevant to them as well as ensuring that their Selfridges experience is as tailored and easy as possible and delivers the very best Selfridges experience. This may involve cookies or similar technology on our Sites, and you have the choice whether or not you want to consent to such cookies or similar technology. See our
Cookie Policy
for more details. If cookies or similar technology is not involved, you can still object to receiving personalised advertising or recommendations by contacting us at
dataprotectionofficer@selfridges.co.uk
To analyse customer behaviour. We do this so we can understand how our customers respond to our Sites and Services, events and marketing activity (where applicable) so that we can make sure we’re providing our customers with the products and Services they’re most interested in and to help us classify our audience into user profiles, groups, or segments. To do this, we use shopping habits, information regarding your personal interests, demographic, experiences with our products, and contact preferences. We do this to help us understand our audience better and make sure we’re sending our opted-in customers (i.e., Keyholders) information that they really want to hear about. We do this using our CRM and digital platforms for online behaviours, such as Google Analytics.
To help us run the test version of our website. We do this so that we can test and pilot new features and ensure the smooth running of our web services.
To improve our Sites and Services. We analyse aggregated customer information with other interactions customers have with us in order to continually improve the products and services we offer through our Sites. We do this using third parties such as Google Analytics. We also track usage statistics on our Sites using aggregated data. By using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our content and how visitors use our Sites and our Services. This allows us to learn what pages to target our adverts so that they’re more relevant to you.
To facilitate events. We often use Eventbrite as our ticketing service. When you register for an event on Eventbrite, your personal information will be shared with us. We may also share your personal information with other trusted third parties who may be supporting us with the event, such as alternative booking platforms, caterers or who we are partnering with to host the event, such as one of our brand partners.
To allow you to connect to our in-store Wi-Fi. Once you have connected to our in-store Wi-Fi, you will automatically be re-connected when you return into the store unless you choose to forget the network in your device settings.
To keep our customers, team members and visitors safe, we use CCTV recording equipment in and around our premises for monitoring and security purposes. We may share where necessary CCTV footage with third parties such as the Police. This is very strictly controlled. We also have stringent health and safety processes in place to help keep our customers safe when shopping in our stores. In the event of an accident, information may be shared with internal departments and third parties such as our insurers.
To prevent stock loss we may use CCTV imagery to detect and prevent theft or fraudulent activity in store and online. We may also use information to minimise credit risk.
We may use your personal information in connection with a business transition (such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or a sale of all of or portion of our assets), to enforce our legal rights and/or to protect the rights of third parties and it is in our legitimate interest to do so. In such instances it will be necessary to share your personal information with external professional advisors such as lawyers and accountants, or insurers or financial institutions.
Where we have a legal obligation
To enforce our legal rights. In such instances it will be necessary to share your personal information with external parties such as administrative authorities (HMRC), the Financial Conduct Authority, police, and public prosecutors or to comply with a court order or power of attorney. We may also have legal obligations to overseas tax authorities and will be required to share your personal information for these purposes
To undertake customer checks to know our customers and verify their identity. For example, we may use your information to conduct online searches with Thomson Reuters World-Check, to assist us with meeting our legal requirements. We may also be required to share your information to report any suspicious and/or criminal activity including fraud, sanctions, and anti-money laundering. It is our legal obligation to do so.
In the event of an accident in store which results in an injury, we may be required to make a report to the Health and Safety Executive under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (“RIDDOR”).
Third Parties we may work with:
To provide our Sites and Services, we work with a number of carefully selected and trusted third parties. We share only the information they need to perform their specific service and we only permit these third parties to use your personal information to the extent necessary to provide us with their services and products.
Sharing your information with these third parties may mean that we transfer your personal information to countries that are outside the UK. If we do this, we have procedures in place to ensure your personal information receives the same protection as if it were being processed in the UK, such as ensuring that the country provides an adequate level of protection for personal information through an adequacy decision or by putting in place appropriate standard contractual clauses.
Below you can find examples of the types of third parties who we may share your personal information with:
• Payment providers that we use to process your payment information (including your credit/debit card details) so that we can collect payment from you and process your order.
• Courier and delivery companies in order to deliver the products to you. These companies act as separate data controllers during the delivery process.
• Product manufacturers or suppliers when you purchase a product from our site that is delivered by the manufacturer or supplier of that product. We will pass on your contact details so that they can deliver the product to you.
• Brand concession partners in order to provide you with a service or to resolve a customer query or complaint that relates to the brand concession partner’s product or service.
• Professional service providers, such as email delivery suppliers, IT software providers, CRM tool providers, marketing agencies, booking platform suppliers, analytics companies and website hosts who help us to run our business.
• Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies for the prevention of fraud and crime.
• Customer Service management providers that allow us to provide our customer services and improve and manage your customer experience.
• Performance Marketing, Recommendations, and Retail Media Providers that help us deliver advertising and recommendations of products on our Sites that are tailored to your interests and needs.
• Research companies that we can engage to help us carry out surveys regarding your use of our Sites and Services.
• Advertising and social media partners that you select (including Facebook. Google, and TikTok), where they require the information to serve relevant ads about our products and services to you and others. This is based on either your marketing consent or your acceptance of cookies on our Sites.
Links or Buttons to Third Party Websites:
Our website, app and emails contain links to third party websites, tools, and services. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website, click on a third-party button (e.g., social media messaging sites, share tools, like buttons) or request a service from a third party, our Privacy Policy no longer applies. Your browsing and interaction on any other third-party tool or service is subject to that website’s or third-party tool or service provider’s own rules and policies. We do not monitor, control, or endorse the privacy practices of any third parties.
We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit, or third-party tool or service provider that you deal with, and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.
From time to time, we work with trusted partners to run microsites (e.g., for exclusive product launches or events). Where the microsite is run by our partner, that partner’s privacy policy will apply.
Please be aware that these third party websites might send cookies when you click on a link or button. We don't control the setting of these third-party cookies, so we suggest you check the third- party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.
Joint Controllers:
In certain, very limited circumstances, we are jointly responsible for determining the collection and/or use of your personal information with third party organisations (this is known as being a “joint controller”).
This is the case with our affiliate marketing partners, such as Partnerize, who we work with to help us measure the success of our relevant marketing campaigns.  This is also the case with our retail media partners, such as Criteo. who we work with to deliver sponsored advertising on our Sites.
The personal information (such as IP addresses and cookie IDs) that is collected through the use of cookies or similar technologies on our Sites will be collected and transmitted by each party as joint controllers in accordance with data protection laws. Our
Cookie Policy
provides more detail about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use for the above purposes (including how you can manage the use of such cookies and similar technologies). Any further processing of personal information outside collection and transmission is carried out by each party as separate data controllers and will be used by the affiliate marketing partner or retail media partner within their models for their own purposes. We will no longer be deemed to be acting as a joint controller at that point. Please see the privacy policy of the relevant affiliate marketing partner or retail media partner for information as to how they will process and safeguard your personal information once it has been collected on our Sites.
As set out below (“
Your Rights
”) you have certain rights with regards to your personal information collected on our Sites. Should you wish to submit a request in respect of this personal information, the request can be submitted either to us (as set out in this Privacy Policy) or to the relevant joint controller (or to both of us). The party you submit a request to will be responsible for dealing with the request and responding to you.
How we protect your personal information:
We are committed to keeping the personal information you provide to us secure, and we will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration.
We have implemented information security policies, rules, and technical measures, such as securing access to our website and app using ‘https’ technology and encrypting payment card information, to protect the personal information that we have under our control from:
• unauthorised access
• improper use or disclosure
• unauthorised modification
• unlawful destruction or accidental loss
All of our team members and third parties that we work with who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personal information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of the personal information of all users of our Sites and Services.
How long we keep your personal information for:

C. Children’s Privacy Policy
Children’s Privacy Policy
At Selfridges, we always look after the information you give us. Any information you share with us that tells us about you is called “personal information”.
If you want to know more about how we use the personal information we collect about you, then you’ve come to the right place!
Shopping on our website
First thing’s first, if you are under 16, please ask your parent or guardian to make any purchases on our website. We ask that you do not use our website or create an account with us unless you are 16 years old or over.
When you, or your parent or guardian, shops on our website or our app, we collect personal information about you, or your parent or guardian, so that we can send you your order or arrange for you to come and collect it in one of our stores. If you are under 16 and want to collect your order in store, please ask you parent or guardian to do so.
Marketing
We won’t send you marketing emails unless you sign up to receive our newsletters. Our email newsletters are intended for anyone over 16, please do not sign up for them if you are under 16. We also won’t use your personal information to tailor Selfridges adverts to you on our website, or any other website.
Cookies
We do collect something called “cookies”. Sadly, they are not the yummy chocolatey kind, but we do need to collect them to make sure that our website works properly when you use it, and to understand how we can make our website even better for you and our other visitors.
Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer. They are designed to hold a small amount of information about you so that we can remember your preferences and make sure that our site works well for you. When you first visit our website, you will see that there is a banner that pops up at the bottom of the screen and asks you if you are happy for us to collect various cookies used on our website, or just some of them. If you change your mind and want to tell us to stop collecting cookies, just click
here
[FB1]
to update your choices.
Third Parties
We won’t ever buy any personal information about you from other websites or companies, and we will never sell your personal information onto anyone else.
We often work with other companies to be able to offer you fun products and events, or to allow us to understand what our customers are interested in and to make sure we are providing you with great products and services we know you’ll enjoy. Sometimes we will need to share your personal information with these companies (or they will share your personal information with us). We will only ever work with companies we trust and who we know will take really good care of your personal information. .
Visiting our Stores
If you visit any of our stores, you may notice that we use security cameras, known as “CCTV” to make sure that we can keep our visitors safe and help prevent any crime in store.
We also provide Wi-Fi in store which our customers are welcome to use. We ask that you only connect to our Wi-Fi if you at least 16 years old. If you choose to use our in-store Wi-Fi, we will collect a little bit of information about the device you are using so that can understand how many people are using our Wi-Fi but we won’t be able to identify you from this.
Your Rights and how to get in touch
Did you know that you have lots of rights to help you look after your personal information? For example, if you don’t want Selfridges to have your personal information anymore, you can contact us and ask us to delete it! If you want us to stop using your personal information for a particular reason, then you can ask us to stop. You can also ask for a copy of all the personal information we hold about you, too!
It’s really easy to get in touch with us and ask us any questions about how we use your personal information, or to tell us that you want to use any of your rights. You can simply email us at dataprotectionofficer@selfridges.co.uk and we will be happy to help!
Changes to this Policy
Sometimes, we might need to make changes to this Policy if we change how we use your personal information. So, we recommend that you come back and check the Policy from time to time.
If we make any really big changes to how we use your personal information, we’ll always make sure that it is really clear what we’ve changed, and you can always contact us if you have any questions.
Parents and guardians, or anyone aged 18 or over can find our full customer Privacy Policy
