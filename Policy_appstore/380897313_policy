Why we collect, hold, use and share personal information
The primary reason we collect, use or share your personal information is to enable the delivery, development and improvement of our products and services and to keep you informed.
We may also collect, use, or share this personal information for other purposes, such as:
to send you parcel notifications and service messages about important updates impacting our services
communicating with you or your representatives about our other products and services via digital and non-digital channels including via phone, email, mail, chat functions, social media and websites. Sometimes, you might tick a box to let us know you would like to receive marketing, and sometimes we might gather from your interactions and relationship with us, that you would like to hear about our other products and services. You can always opt out of marketing by following the instructions on the message, email or letter you receive or by reaching out to our customer services team on the contact details below
to develop and improve our products and services and improve the safety of our people, customers and community. Sometimes this may involve combining data that we have with other sources of data and information from other sources and organisations such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
to produce and provide insights, trends, and other relevant information to the public and our customers in a way that does not identify you to anyone receiving the insight and trend information
where permitted, authorised or required by an applicable law, such as to Australian Government agencies, overseas postal and delivery services and international governmental agencies, AUSTRAC to meet transaction reporting obligations, or to the Australian Crime Intelligence Commission (ACIC), State or Federal Police or Border Force for crime related investigations
to verify your identity in person or digitally, using third-party business partners to check your details back to the source

to link your accounts and product or service holdings, to provide you with a more seamless user experience
to identify and better interact with your device using cookies or other similar technologies.

When we share personal information
To perform our functions and services, we use and rely on various suppliers, agents, partners and subcontractors (Suppliers).  In order to perform those functions and services we may disclose your personal information to those Suppliers who may use, process, store and transform that information to provide service or function to us. We require Suppliers to protect your information in accordance with Australian Privacy law. Some of our Suppliers provide services using cloud and hosting which may be outside Australia.
Where you undertake a transaction processed by us on behalf of an agency or merchant, we may also share some information back with that third party to complete the transaction or keep them informed.
Overseas use and disclosure
When you send letters or parcels overseas, we may send personal information to countries outside Australia to facilitate the delivery. This information may be handled in line with the laws and customs of those countries. Similarly, when you receive an article from overseas, delivery to you within Australia is under Australian privacy laws, even though you may have provided your personal information under the laws of another country.
Sometimes, we use systems or service providers located in other countries. When we do this, we will ensure your personal information is managed in a way that is consistent with Australian privacy law and this Privacy Statement, even if we need to undertake to comply with the applicable laws of those other countries.
We use service providers in other countries, including:
Japan
United States of America
Singapore
European Union
New Zealand
India
the Philippines

Our other obligations
Australia Post has privacy and information management obligations in addition to those in the Privacy Act, which may impact how we handle information, including your personal information.
These include:
The Archives Act
– As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post has obligations under the Archives Act 1983, which requires us to keep information for varying lengths of time.
Australian Postal Corporations Act
– The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 includes limitations on how we use information as well as some permitted situations where we may disclose articles and their contents, such as where reasonably necessary for law enforcement activities.

How we protect children's privacy
Australia Post believes it is important to provide added protection for children. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate in and monitor their online activity.
When we provide a product or service that intentionally collects personal information from children, such as a police check, we will use reasonable efforts to confirm parent or guardian consent prior to the collection and use of personal information. The way we do this may vary depending on the information, product, service, or event that the child wishes to participate in. Consent may take a variety of forms such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail, or online consent such as by ticking an online check box that parental or guardian consent has been obtained.
Parents or guardians may, subject to any applicable laws, request that information collected from their child be deleted.

How you can access your personal information
You have a right to request access to your personal information, and we want to make it easy for you to do so. The information you want to access to may be via your MyPost account, or can be accessed by contacting our customer services team.
If you can’t find what you’re after, you can contact us via our details below. Once we receive your request, and subject to relevant privacy laws, we will respond to your request within a reasonable time – usually within 30 days. We ask that you identify, as clearly as possible, the type/s of information requested. In some cases, we may need to verify your identity before we share information with you.
We may not be able to provide access to all your personal information. In some situations, the law permits us to refuse your request to provide you with access to your personal information. For example, where giving access to your information would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals, or would pose a serious threat to the life, health, or safety of any individual or to public health or public safety.

How you can correct your personal information
Ensuring your personal information is accurate and up-to-date is crucial for the delivery of many of our services, and you have a right to request the correction of your personal information. We try to make this easy for you, and you’ll see opportunities to update your details throughout our product and service offerings, such as our mobile app. If you’re unsure about how to do this, you can contact our customer services team.
