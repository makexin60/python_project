In addition to the data collection from log files, we also collect the following information when you use our App:
- Email Address: When you login to the App via Apple, Google, or Facebook, we record your email address and link it to your corresponding account. This enables us to keep track of your user profile, associated data, and provide access to the App's full range of functions. As a result, you may periodically receive newsletters containing plant cultivation tips, important App announcements, and other related content. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time. For more details on how your data is handled when receiving newsletters, please refer to the "Email communications" subsection in our Privacy Policy.
- Registration Information: If you choose to register with the App by linking your Apple ID, Google, or Facebook account, we will process your chosen method of registration, email address, name, and, if applicable, the photo associated with your account.

Automatic Processing of Information
With your consent, our App utilizes third-party automated data processing technologies, such as different API tools and advertising / analytics tools to analyze specific data transmitted by your device. Some of these integrated tools may initiate the automated processing of your personal data, including profiling. Profiling involves the automated processing of personal data to evaluate individual characteristics such as interests, preferences, behavior, location, or movements. Automatic data processing starts when you grant permission for our App to track your activities.
For purposes aligned with our legitimate interests, we may process certain data pertaining to your device and user activity. This data falls under the categories specified in the "Automatic Processing of Information" subsection and is generally non-personal in nature. This means that it does not directly identify any particular individual, and we access and analyze it in an aggregated form. We utilize this information to enhance our App and ensure our users receive the best possible experience.
When using our App on a mobile device (including tablets, phones, smartwatches etc.), certain device-related details are reported, including "device identifiers." These identifiers are small data files or similar structures that uniquely identify the device while keeping personal information anonymous. This enables us to offer generalized reporting and personalized content and advertisements from third parties.
Types of Processed Data:
- Device Information: This encompasses details about your device, such as its type, operating system and version, model, manufacturer, screen size and density, orientation, audio volume, battery information, and memory usage.
- Internet Connection Information: This refers to data regarding your internet connection, including mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP address, timestamp and duration of sessions, connection speed, and browser information.
- Location-Related Information: This pertains to details tied to your location, such as IP address, country, region, state, city associated with the SIM card or device, language settings, time zone, and nearby commercial points of interest like coffee shops.
- App Data Reporting: Our App may be subject to automated processing and analysis, which involves reporting its name, API key (a unique identifier for the application), version, and properties. Some services also record the list of installed or running applications and processes on your device.
- Cookies and Similar Technologies: When using our App, we may utilize cookies and comparable technologies, such as pixels, web beacons, and scripts. A cookie is a small text file stored on your device when you access the App, which is sent back to the server upon each subsequent App usage. Cookies assist us in making the App more effective by tracking user access to specific areas or features and monitoring link or advertisement clicks. This aggregated information helps us comprehend and optimize App usage, improve our marketing efforts, and deliver relevant content and features. Additionally, advertisers or partners may serve ads or provide services to the App using cookies or similar technologies.
- Ad viewing data: Information related to the ads you view may include the date and time the ad was shown whether it was clicked or if it resulted in a conversion event, the content of the ad offer, the ad type (e.g., text, image, video), the placement of the ad within the App, and your response to the ad.
- App Analytics: When using our App, analytics tools automatically record various events, such as taps, scrolls, screens visited within the App, tutorial steps, leveling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progression events, and methods used to limit user data processing.
Disclaimer Regarding Data Processing by Third Parties
Please note that we do not have direct control over the data automatically provided to API tools or advertising / analytics tools. Therefore, we cannot be held responsible for how this data is processed. It is important to understand that certain services may create personal data profiles and access information related to your identity and/or device using technologies beyond our control. If your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may utilize your device information in combination with categorized data already stored within their databases, such as your age, gender, or other demographic criteria. We do not have jurisdiction over, cannot monitor, and do not provide guarantees about how third parties handle your personal data, which may be collected through methods unrelated to our App. If you have any inquiries concerning the disclosure of your personal data, kindly direct them to these third parties (refer to the "Sharing of Your Information" section).
Email Communications
If you log in to our App using Apple, Google, or Facebook, your email address associated with your respective account may be utilized to send you communications, such as newsletters, regarding special subscription offers, new features, and other App-related information. You may have the option to provide your email address in the App Settings or through a separate popup window to receive our newsletters. When signing in with Apple, you can choose to keep your personal email address private by selecting the "Hide my email" option, which generates a random email address that forwards messages to your personal inbox. You have the freedom to unsubscribe from receiving emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link provided in each message.
Sharing of Your Information
Your information will only be disclosed to third parties in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We comply with the U.S. Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for the Mobile Environment. Our partnerships are exclusively with third parties that have provided assurances of employing the necessary technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted directly from the App to these third parties, and we are not responsible for any accidental loss or unauthorized access to your personal data resulting from their actions.
We do not rent or sell your personal data to third parties. Nonetheless, we may share certain information obtained from tools such as log files, device identifiers, and location data with third-party organizations that offer automatic data processing technologies for the App. We have no control over these third parties' tracking technologies or their usage.
Please also note that facial and skin scanning technology is performed by a third party, which uses the images uploaded to provide detailed scan results, possible diagnoses and video/text recommendations on the relevant topic. All images that the user uploads to the Application are transferred to this third party, and the photo materials are stored on their servers. However, materials provided by the user are stored solely for the purpose of improving internal algorithms and the operation of the artificial intelligence system, that is, they are NOT sold or distributed further.
Please note that we do not use, publish and/or sell media content provided by the end users for scanning purposes. All materials provided by the end users are used only to improve the stability and operation of the mobile application algorithm and object recognition purposes. All user’s media content is deleted from our cloud storage systems within an hour of the completion of the scan and is only used to train the neural network running on the mobile App. The user can always view the history of their scans in their personal account. The history is available until the user decides to delete the data.
