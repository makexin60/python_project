PlomGit
PlomGit is a basic, open source git client for iOS and Android. Although it only supports a limited number of features, it should be sufficient for version controlling personal files.
It is programmed using Flutter and uses the
libgit2 library
.
The source code for PlomGit is available on
GitHub
.
Using PlomGit with GitHub
First you should generate a passcode token with GitHub. This is only necessary if you need to access private repositories or push changes to repositories. If you're just cloning public repositories, it's not necessary to store credentials in PlomGit.
Go to
github.com
website and login
Go to the settings section of the website
Go to the Developer Settings
Go to the Personal Access Tokens section
Generate a new token and configure the token to have "repo" access
Copy the generated token to your clipboard
You can then go into PlomGit and store your access token in the app.
From the main screen on PlomGit, press the three dots in the upper-right to open the menu, and then choose Accounts
Press the big + sign to create a new account
Give a name to the account such as "GitHub"
Put your github user name into the User section
Paste the personal access token from your clipboard into the "password or token" box
Hit create
Go back to the main screen of PlomGit
You can now clone a repository. First, get the URL of a repository
In a web browser, find the repository on github that you want to clone
If there is a green Code button, you can select it, and a menu will appear with the HTTPS clone URL for the repository
On many mobile browsers, GitHub does not show the Code button, so you will need to guess what the Git URL for the repository is. In most cases, you can simply take the URL for the project and add ".git" on the end to get the URL for the git repository
You can then clone the repository in PlomGit
From the main screen, press the big + button
Choose "clone repository" from the menu
Supply a name for the repository
Put the URL for the git repository in the "Remote URL" section
If you set-up a passcode token earlier, then switch from "Optional Password Login" to "Saved Credentials" using the drop-down
Then make sure it is using the correct saved credentials
Choose "Clone" to clone the repository

Privacy Policy
Storing user data properly and securely is a heavy responsibility, and I do not want to take on that burden. As such, the app does not intentionally gather information about users.
