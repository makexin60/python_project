PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
‚Äç
As part of our App push notifications, we'll also send you push notifications when the price of our 35+ crypto goes up or down. The crypto price alerts may be delayed or disrupted, so you may not receive a price alert each time the prices of the crypto asset increase or decrease.Price alerts are based on the information on the market price of cryptocurrencies that is shared with us by an external source that we believe to be reliable. However, we do not control the external sources or the data they provide, and we do not always independently verify that the information provided is complete and accurate. For purposes of price alerts, we do not receive real-time pricing information, but instead compare the crypto price at regular intervals. Therefore, we do not guarantee or warrant that the information provided in price alerts is accurate, complete, timely, or suitable for use, and it may be inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.These alerts are designed to provide information about movements in the crypto market, but should not be your sole way of monitoring and making decisions involving crypto. Market conditions and data outages may also result in delays or disruptions to crypto price alerts. You should verify any price alert information you receive before you act on it and we have no liability to you if you make decisions based on the price alerts that you receive from or through us or based on your failure to receive a price alert. Price alerts are provided for informational purposes only, and do not constitute a recommendation by Oobit to buy, sell or hold any asset.

Shoppers can choose if they want to pay via any Digital wallet or immediately by Oobit personal account ( App ).

The wallet owner is solely responsible for safekeeping passwords and private keys used to access their wallet, as well as maintaining the security protocols and updates on devices used to download and use their wallet. If a Shopper or Merchant chooses to use Oobit personal account, they do so subject to the Oobit Pay Terms of Use.Oobit is not responsible for, and cannot assist with recovery of, a loss of cryptocurrency funds incurred by a Merchant or Shopper if a wallet is compromised, for example due to loss of or unauthorized access to private keys, accidental sharing of a backup, a bug in the user's device or the wallet software, or a malicious attack on the wallet software.In the event your account balance gets settled to a wallet that becomes compromised or inaccessible, or in the event a Shopper's wallet becomes compromised or inaccessible, it is up to you to decide how to handle any inquiries or potential claims. Oobit does not get involved in resolving such issues.

‚Äç
10. INVOICES10.1 INVOICE GENERATION AND COMPETITIVE EXCHANGE RATE GUARANTEE FOR YOUR SHOPPER
‚Äç
In order to accept a cryptocurrency payment, you need to create a payment request (‚ÄúInvoice‚Äù) using the Services, based on the amount you want to collect in your settlement currency, or in any of the supported cryptocurrencies. Oobit's hosted invoice user interface must be displayed to the Shopper during checkout.When Oobit processes payments, we use Oobit's exchange rate. Once a shopper starts the payment process on Oobit's checkout page, the Shopper will receive a limited time frame, displayed by a timer, on the QR code page. The Shopper has to complete the transaction by the end of the displayed time frame.While we guarantee the exchange rate for the Shopper as long as the Shopper pays within such a time window, you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your settlement currency. For example, if you ask us to collect 75.00 Euro and the Shopper sends the cryptocurrency equivalent within the time window, we guarantee you will receive exactly 75.00 Euro, minus our fee, but we do not guarantee the future value of the Euro (or any other fiat currency) relative to any benchmark. Similarly, if you elect to receive some or all of your settlement in cryptocurrency, we do not guarantee the future value of that cryptocurrency relative to any benchmark.
‚Äç
10.2 INVOICE COMPLETION
‚Äç
An Invoice is considered ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù by us if it has been fully paid by the Shopper, the corresponding transaction has reached our required number of block confirmations, and the payment has been credited to your Account.The number of confirmations required for a transaction depends on several factors, including the blockchain being used and our internal analysis of risk.We employ risk mitigation techniques such as Eliptic, a Blockchain Analytics service to detect fraudulent payments, such as payments that are at risk of never receiving the required number of block confirmations. However, these measures do not completely eliminate the risk associated with unconfirmed payments.A confirmed Invoice means that payment has been made and the required block confirmations have occurred, such that the transaction has passed our risk validation measures, but it still needs to be credited to your Account.You have the option to inform your Shopper that you have accepted the Invoice as paid before Oobit deems the Invoice completed, e.g. an Invoice payment that is not confirmed. Oobit is not liable for settling Invoices which are not considered fully paid and complete. In other words, if you accept a payment before it is credited by us to your Account ledger, we are not required to settle with you if we determine that the payment was fraudulent or otherwise invalid.
‚Äç
10.3 OOBIT SUPPORTED CRYPTOCURRENCIES
‚Äç
Oobit may add new cryptocurrencies to the Services. Additional cryptocurrencies will be added to the Services on an opt-out basis, such that they will be enabled by default unless you instruct Oobit to disable them. In addition, there may be circumstances that cause Oobit to decide to remove a particular cryptocurrency as a payment option.
‚Äç
10.4 PAYMENT EXCEPTIONS
‚Äç
On the QR code (payment page) in the Oobit App, few scenarios may occur ("Payment Exceptions"):-"Payment Paid On-time" - payment process was successfully completed.-"Invoice Paid Out of time" - the payment was received out of the allocated time frame and partial fees are missing to complete full payment.-"Partial payment" - partial payment was received and fees are missing to complete full payment.-"No payment detected" - No payment was detected by Oobit.-"Timed Out" - payment time has expired.Shoppers will automatically receive a notification via email and/or SMS messaging and/or push notification from Oobit in order to claim the missing fees as applicable.
‚Äç
10.4.1 PARTIAL PAYMENT
‚Äç
Partial payment cannot fulfill an Invoice in full. To complete the transaction, the Shopper will need to click on the "Complete payment" option and complete the transaction. In case the time frame for payment was expired, the Shopper will have to generate a new invoice. The new Invoice will provide the Shopper with a new payment amount based on the then-current exchange rate and a new time window in which to complete the payment.
‚Äç
10.4.4 UNSUPPORTED PAYMENTS
‚Äç
Unless explicitly mentioned on our website or in this Agreement, we do not support or process payments for unsupported coins, tokens, or blockchain forks, collectively known as ‚ÄúUnsupported Payments‚Äù ("Unsupported Payments"). Shoppers should not pay an Invoice with Unsupported Payments. If a Shopper transmits Unsupported Payments, the Shopper may lose any perceived value in the Unsupported Payments. Additionally, Oobit assumes no responsibility whatsoever with respect to Unsupported Payments and Shoppers will not be able to recover Unsupported Payments from Oobit.
‚Äç
10.5 DELAYED SETTLEMENT
‚Äç
If we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Account, or if required by law, court order, or at the request of law enforcement, we may delay settlement or restrict access to settlement funds. In the case of a delayed settlement, we will strive to promptly inform you, unless prohibited by court order or law enforcement. We will not be liable to you for any damages or harm caused as a result of such delayed settlement or restricted access. Unless required to delay settlement by law, we are committed to not delay or restrict settlement unnecessarily, and if partial delay or restriction is possible, we will only partially delay or restrict. Once the reasons for delayed settlement or restricted access to settlement funds can be reasonably proven to have been resolved, Oobit will pay the full amount of such funds to you without undue delay.
‚Äç
10.6 ACCOUNT INFORMATION
‚Äç
You will have access to Account information via your dashboard detailing the following:-Activity overview-Full transactions details-Setting, include the tech details that are needed for integration, an option to link a bank account for settlement, and more.You can connect to the service (technically) by a simple API.

11.
REFUNDS11.1 GENERAL PROCEDURES
‚Äç
Oobit can facilitate cryptocurrency refunds to Shoppers on your behalf. You can decide to issue a partial refund or refund the full amount of the initial purchase. You can also decide whether to issue the refund based upon the value in which the relevant goods and/or services were priced (pricing currency) or the amount of the applicable cryptocurrency used to pay the Invoice (payment currency). Refunds will be remitted in the same cryptocurrency used to pay the Invoice. If you do not have enough funds in your Account to cover pending refund requests, we may require you to make a bank deposit to an account specified by us. Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate determined by us.
‚Äç
11.2 DISCLOSURE OF MERCHANT REFUND POLICY
‚Äç
Oobit is not responsible for merchant refund policies, or for verifying that such policies conform to applicable law. We suggest merchants provide a clear refund policy to their customers (including, if applicable, ‚Äúno refunds are allowed as all sales are final‚Äù). For certain industries, a refund policy may not be applicable (e.g., where a service is provided). For refunds in amounts based upon the fiat pricing currency (i.e., the fiat price for the applicable goods/services), Oobit will convert the value of the currency in which the item was priced to the applicable cryptocurrency using the exchange rate at the time the refund is sent to the Shopper.
‚Äç
12. COMPLAINTS12.1 SHOPPER COMPLAINTS
‚Äç
If we receive a complaint from a Shopper and it relates to you or the purchased goods/services, we will send it to you for resolution. We reserve the right to terminate Merchant accounts that receive excessive complaints (see Section 4.7.2, Our Right to Decline, Suspend, or Close Your Account).

What is GDPR
Following large corporations selling off users' personal data and treating it as a commodity, the EU put together a set of laws that prohibit them, and anyone else, from doing so. The General Data Protection Regulation was officially implemented in May 2018 and is a legal requirement for anyone offering digital services in the EU. The GDPR was created to enhance individuals' privacy rights and put significantly enhanced obligations on companies that handle personal data. It is based off of seven principles as outlined below:
- Right to Access
. At any point, users can request how their data is being used as well as gain access to their personal data at no charge.
- Right to Erasure
. Should a company terminate their or a users' services, the user may request that their data be deleted.
‚Äç
-
Right to Data Portability
. Users have the right to switch providers, companies may not conduct a ‚Äúvendor lock-in‚Äù and withhold your personal data.
-
Right to Be Informed
. Companies may not collect users' data without their permission, and must inform the individual on what they will be using it for.
-
Right to Restrict Processing
. Users can request that their data is only recorded but not processed in any way (used).
-
Right to Object
. Users can request for the immediate halt of the processing of their data for marketing purposes, and companies must comply.
-
Right to Be Notified
. Companies need to notify users within 72 hours should there be a data breach that compromises a users' personal data.
‚Äç
WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?
While the legislation is centred around protecting your personal data, we're here to cover exactly what that means. In a nutshell, personal data refers to any information that can be used to identify you. This might include:
Usernames
Passwords
Phone number
Cookies
Name
Facial image
ID number
Residential address
Postal address
IP address
Email address
