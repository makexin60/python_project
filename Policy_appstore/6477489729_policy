Why is human review of my Gemini Apps conversations, feedback, and related data required?
How human review helps improve models
Google uses conversations (as well as feedback and related data) from Gemini Apps users to improve Google services so we can make them safer, more helpful, and work better for all users. These include the generative machine-learning models that power Gemini Apps and technologies that help reduce unintended activations of Gemini Apps. Human review is a necessary step of the model improvement process. Through their review, rating, and rewrites, human reviewers (which include third parties) help enable quality improvements of generative machine-learning models like the ones that power Gemini Apps.
How we protect your privacy in this process
We take a number of precautions to protect your privacy during this human review process:
Conversations (as well as feedback and related data like your language, device type, or location info) that reviewers see and annotate are not associated with any user accounts.
We pick a random sample for such human review, and only a portion of all Gemini Apps conversations are reviewed.
How the process works
Our trained reviewers look at conversations to assess if Gemini Apps’ responses are low-quality, inaccurate, or harmful.
From there, trained evaluators suggest higher-quality responses.
These are then used to create a better dataset for generative machine-learning models to learn from so our models can produce improved responses in the future.
How long is reviewed data retained
Gemini Apps conversations that have been reviewed by human reviewers (as well as feedback and related data like your language, device type, or location info) are not deleted when you delete your Gemini Apps activity because they are kept separately and are not connected to your Google Account. Instead, they are retained for up to 3 years.
How you can control what’s shared with reviewers
If you turn off
Gemini Apps Activity
, future conversations won’t be sent for human review or used to improve our generative machine-learning models.
Don’t enter anything you wouldn’t want a human reviewer to see or Google to use.
For example, don’t enter info you consider confidential or data you don’t want to be used to improve Google products, services, and machine-learning technologies.
Learn more
about how to turn off, manage, and delete your Gemini Apps activity
at any time. Also, you can control Google’s storage of Gemini Apps activity in
My Activity
at any time.
Why does Google retain my conversations after I turn off Gemini Apps Activity and what does Google do with this data?
Google needs these conversations to respond to you and as context for feedback you choose to submit to help maintain and improve Gemini Apps, and to provide all users a safer and better quality experience.
Here are more details about conversations stored with your account even after you turn off Gemini Apps Activity:
Before you give feedback in Gemini Apps
If
Gemini Apps Activity
is off, Google retains your conversations with your account for up to 72 hours. This activity won’t appear in your Gemini Apps Activity and is used to:
Respond to your conversation contextually. For this purpose, Gemini Apps use only 24 hours of data.
Maintain the safety and security of Gemini Apps and improve Gemini Apps. For this purpose, Google needs the 72-hour retention period to help ensure that data from its backend processes is available in case of a potential failure in its systems.
If you turn off
Gemini Apps Activity
, Google does not use your new conversations stored with your account to improve its generative machine learning technologies, unless you submit feedback about a conversation.
After you give feedback in Gemini Apps
If you decide to send feedback to Google, Google’s systems collect the following information:
Your feedback.
Any included content, such as files and images you upload, as well as your personal content that Gemini gets from connected apps.
Context that can help us better understand your feedback. This includes the last 24 hours of available conversation data, such as your prompts and Gemini Apps' responses.

What does it mean that Gemini is a new and evolving technology?
Gemini Apps (previously Bard) are powered by large language models, as explained in
this overview of Bard
by James Manyika (Google’s SVP, Technology and Society). Like most large language models (LLMs), the models powering Gemini Apps were pre-trained on a variety of data from publicly available sources.
How LLMs work
With pre-training, LLMs find patterns in language and use them to predict the next probable word or words in a sequence. However, if an LLM picks only the most probable next word, responses would be less creative. That’s why LLMs are often given some flexibility. They can pick from a range of reasonable and slightly less probable words to generate more interesting responses.
Why responses aren’t always accurate
LLMs can at times perform well on factual prompts and seem like they’re looking up information, but they're not information databases or retrieval systems. When you query a database, you can expect the same exact response each time. But, when you give the same prompt to an LLM, you won’t necessarily get the same response every time or the actual information that the LLM was trained on. This is because LLMs are trained to predict the next most probable word, not get information.
This is also an important factor in why LLMs can generate plausible-sounding but inaccurate responses about people and other topics. This isn’t ideal when factuality matters, but it’s potentially useful for generating creative or unexpected responses.
Why Gemini Apps are new and evolving
Gemini Apps are part of our long-term, ongoing effort to develop LLMs responsibly. Throughout the course of this work, we discovered and discussed several limitations associated with LLMs, including five areas we continue to work on:
Accuracy:
Gemini Apps’ responses about people and other topics might be inaccurate, especially when asked about complex or factual issues.
Bias:
Gemini Apps’ responses might reflect biases or perspectives about people or other topics present in its training data.
Persona:
Gemini Apps’ responses might suggest it as having personal opinions or feelings.
False positives and false negatives:
Gemini Apps might not respond to some appropriate prompts and provide inappropriate responses to others.
Vulnerability to adversarial prompting:
users will find ways to stress test Gemini Apps further. For example, they may prompt Gemini Apps to hallucinate and provide inaccurate information about people and other topics.
We focused on addressing these areas before launching Gemini Apps. And with the broader field, we continue to research solutions. We at Google are committed to working to improve over time.

.
What happens when I ask Gemini Apps to save info?
Information you’ve asked Gemini to save (for example, “Remember that …”) is used to provide more custom responses in Gemini Apps.
Info is saved until you delete it, and you can turn this setting off at any time.
Learn how to delete saved info or turn off this setting
.
Location & other permissions information
What location information do Gemini Apps collect, why, and how is it used?
Location data is always collected if you use Gemini Apps so that they can provide you with a response that is relevant to your query. For example, to respond to prompts like "What's the weather?", Gemini Apps need to know your location.
Where Gemini Apps get location data & how its used
The source of the location data Gemini Apps collect varies. By default, Gemini Apps use the general area from your IP address or the Home or Work addresses in your Google Account to give relevant responses to prompts like “What’s the weather?”
With your permission, Gemini Apps also process precise location data from your device to provide more relevant responses. For example, Gemini Apps can use your precise location to more accurately respond to prompts like “where is the closest coffee shop to me?”
Google also uses your location data, including your precise location data, for the purposes and based on the legal grounds described in the
Gemini Apps Privacy Notice
. Learn more about location data at
g.co/privacypolicy/location
.
How precise location data is shared
If available, Gemini Apps may share your precise location data with another Google service, like Google Maps, to fulfill your request. The Google service that gets your location data uses it consistent with the
Google Privacy Policy
.
How location data is stored
Precise location is not stored in your Gemini Apps Activity.
Location data that Gemini Apps process is coarsened to a general area before it’s stored with your Gemini Apps Activity. A general area is larger than 3 sq kilometers, and has at least 1000 users so that the general area of your prompt does not identify you, helping to protect your privacy. This means that a general area is typically much larger than 3 sq kilometers outside of cities.

How does Google work with my uploaded images?
How images in prompts work
When you add an image to your prompt, or a screenshot using "Ask about this screen," Gemini Apps also use Google Lens technology to understand what's in the image and read the text. For example, Google Lens might interpret an image's pixels as a cat jumping. Gemini Apps add this information to your prompt to understand your request better. Google uses this information just like any other prompt, as explained in the
Gemini Apps Privacy Notice
.
How we limit use of your actual images
At this time, we don't use the actual images you upload or their pixels to improve our generative machine-learning technologies, unless they're included in feedback. If you
submit feedback on a Gemini App response
, the last image uploaded in the same conversation before that response is included as part of your feedback, unless you opt out. Google uses this data like all other feedback you provide.
Learn more about how Google uses your feedback
.
As we provide new features and improve our services, we will be transparent if we use your images differently.
How does Google use my uploaded files?
When you upload a file with your prompt, Gemini Apps can interpret it in connection with your prompt. This may include analyzing that file to provide information about it in a response.
Google doesn’t currently train its generative AI models using your uploaded files, unless you include them in your feedback.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements

, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:

Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.

On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.

How Google retains data we collect
Intro
Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Location information plays an important role in that mission. From driving directions, to making sure your search results include things near you, to showing you when a restaurant is typically busy, location information can make your experiences across Google more relevant and helpful.
Location information also helps with some core product functionality, like providing a website in the right language or helping to keep Google’s services secure.
The
Google Privacy Policy
describes how Google uses data, including location information, when you use its products and services. This page provides additional details about the location information Google uses and how you can control the ways it may be used. Some data practices may differ for users under the age of 18. Learn more in Google’s
Privacy Notice for Google Accounts and Profiles Managed with Family Link, for Children
and
Google’s Teen Privacy Guide
.
How does Google use location information?
How Google uses location information varies, depending on the service or feature being used and people’s device and account settings. Here are some key ways Google may use location information.
To make experiences useful
Google may use or save location information to provide people with useful services when they interact with Google products, such as providing locally relevant and faster search results, traffic predictions for people’s daily commutes, and suggestions that take into account a person’s context. For example, someone searching for movie times will likely want to see movies at theaters in their neighborhood, not in another city. In Google Maps, location information helps people find their place on a map and navigate to places they’d like to visit.
To help people remember places they’ve been
People can choose to remember places they go with their devices using Timeline. To use Timeline, people can turn on Location History, a Google Account setting that creates a personal map of the places they’ve been and the routes they’ve taken. If you choose to use Location History, your device’s precise locations are saved to a personal map, including when you don’t have Google apps open. This information can be viewed and deleted in Timeline.
To help people find things faster and get more helpful results
Web & App Activity, for example, is a Google account setting that lets people save their activity data and associated information like location, so they can make their experience more personalized when they are signed in across Google services. For example, Search might show results that are relevant to a general area you’ve searched from in the past.
To show more relevant ads
Your location information can help Google show you more relevant ads. When you search for something like “shoe stores near me,” location information can be used to show you ads from shoe stores near you. Or, let’s say you’re searching for pet insurance, advertisers might show different benefits in different areas.
Learn more about how location information is used to show ads
.
To make experiences more secure
Google uses information about your location to provide some basic services, such as keeping your account safe by detecting unusual activity, or a sign-in from a new city.
To show anonymous community trends, estimates, and for research
Google also uses aggregated anonymous location information for research and to show community trends.
To see more ways that location information is used, visit the
Google Privacy Policy
.
How does location work on my Android device and apps?
You can get local search results, commute predictions and find nearby restaurants from your device’s location. Android device settings for your mobile phones or tablets allow you to control whether the location services on your device estimate location, and also whether and how specific apps and services on your device can use that device location.
How you can control apps’ use of device location
You can control which apps have permission to use the device location in your Android device settings. In settings, you have controls that let you choose whether the app can access precise or approximate location. We’ve added controls that allow you to decide whether an app can access the device location anytime, only while the app is in use, if the app has to ask every time, or never. The availability of these settings and controls depends on which Android version your device is running.
Learn more
.
How device location works
Depending on your device settings, Android devices estimate location by using different inputs, including GPS, sensors (such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and barometer), mobile network signals, and Wi-Fi signals. These inputs can be used to estimate the most accurate location possible, which is provided to apps and services on the device that have the required permissions.
Learn more about your Android device’s location settings
.
Mobile and Wi-Fi network signals can help Android estimate the device’s location, especially in environments where GPS signals aren’t available or accurate, including in dense urban areas or when indoors. Google Location Accuracy (GLA, also known as Google Location Services) is a Google service that uses these signals to improve the device’s location estimate.
To provide this more accurate location, when turned on, GLA periodically collects location information from your Android device—including GPS and information about Wi-Fi access points, mobile networks and device sensors—using a temporary rotating device identifier that is not associated with any specific person. GLA uses this information to improve location accuracy and provide location-based services, including by building crowdsourced maps of Wi-Fi access points and mobile network towers.
You can turn off GLA at any time in your Android device’s location settings. Your Android device’s location will continue to work even if GLA is turned off, and the device will rely only on GPS and device sensors to estimate device location.
How does Google know my location?
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful.
This location information can come from real-time signals, like your IP address or from your device, and also your saved activity on Google sites and services. Here are the main ways Google may get information about your location.
From your IP address
An IP address, also called an Internet Protocol address, is a number that is assigned to your computer or device by your Internet Service Provider. IP addresses are used to make the connection between your devices and the websites and services you use.
Like many other internet services, Google may use information about the general area that you’re in to provide some basic services—relevant results, such as when someone does a search asking what time it is, or keeping your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as a sign-in from a new city.
Keep in mind: Devices need an IP address in order to send and receive internet traffic. IP addresses are roughly based on geography. This means that any apps, services, or websites you use, including google.com, may be able to infer and use some information about your general area from your IP address.
From your saved activity
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
If you’re not signed in to your Google Account, Google may store some location information for previous searches from the device you’re using to help provide more relevant results and recommendations. If you turn off Search customization, Google won’t use previous search activity to estimate your location.
Learn more about how to search and browse privately.
From home or work addresses you saved
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and to show you more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account
.
From your device
How Google apps use location from your device
Devices have settings or permissions that you can use to control whether your precise location is available to apps, including Google’s apps like
Search
and
Maps
. This kind of precise location is useful in apps, like Google Maps, to give directions or help you get useful nearby search results. For example, you’ll get more relevant search results for things like local places and weather information when precise location settings or permissions are on.
Both iOS and Android have settings for app location permissions that you can turn on or off. You can let apps use your location to provide location-based features and services. Keep in mind, it’s sometimes necessary for apps to store your precise location temporarily so that they can quickly give you helpful results, or save battery by avoiding the need to keep updating location.
Some apps need access to your device location in the background, such as Find My Device, or if you want to use certain features, like Location Sharing.
For more information on how location works on your Android device, see
here
.
How are Location History and Web & App Activity saved in my Google Account?
Over the coming months and continuing in 2024, the Location History setting will change. Current Location History users are being notified when this change affects their account and, once they are notified, they will begin seeing the name Timeline in their account and app settings.  For those already using Timeline, including users who turned on Timeline directly, the information provided in this page about location data in Location History applies to their use of Timeline.
Learn more
.
Location History and Web & App Activity
Location History and Web & App Activity are Google Account settings that use location. Here’s an overview of each. Keep in mind, other features or products may also collect or store location information.
Location History
If you turn on Location History, it will create Timeline, a personal map that helps you remember places you’ve been, and routes and trips you’ve taken.
Location History is turned off by default. If you turn on Location History, your precise device location is regularly saved, for every eligible mobile device that has the Location Reporting setting turned on. These device locations are used to build your Timeline, even when Google apps aren’t being used.
To make Google experiences more useful for everyone, Location History can be used to
show information, such as popular times and environmental insights, based on anonymized location information
detect and prevent fraud and abuse
improve and develop Google services, including ads products
Location History can also
help businesses
estimate the likelihood that people visit their stores because of an ad.
You can review, edit, and delete what’s saved in your
Timeline
at any time. To see if you’ve turned on Location History, visit your
Activity Controls
. There, you’ll be able to control the Location History setting and control which devices are reporting their location.
How often your precise location is collected as part of the Location History setting varies. For example, if you’re using navigation in Google Maps, it might be collected multiple times per minute. But if you’re not actively using your phone, it could be once every few hours.
How long Location History data is saved depends on your settings—you can choose to automatically delete this data once it’s 3, 18, or 36 months old, or keep the data until you delete it.
Keep in mind
If you turn off Location History
Google will continue to store any past Location History data you’ve saved until you delete it, or it will be deleted after a period of time that you’ve chosen as part of your auto-delete settings.
Turning off Location History doesn’t impact how location information is saved or used by Web & App Activity or other Google products, e.g., based on your IP address. You may still have other settings that save location information.
To see if you’ve turned on Location History, visit your
Activity Controls
.

.
Web & App Activity
Web & App Activity data is used to make your experience more personalized in Maps, Search, and other Google services. It can also be used to show you more relevant ads, depending on your ads settings. Web & App Activity will work across your devices wherever you are signed into your account.
When Web & App Activity is turned on, Google will save data about the things you do across Google services in your account’s
Web & App Activity
. This includes associated information, like the general area where you used a Google service.
For example, if you search for weather information and get results for a location sent from your device, this activity, including the general area your device was in when you searched, is saved to your Web & App Activity. The precise location that your device sent is not stored, only the location’s general area is stored. The saved location, which can be used to help Google determine a more relevant location in a future search, can come from the IP address or your device. This saved location is automatically deleted from your Web & App Activity after 30 days.
Web & App Activity data helps Google to understand general areas that are relevant for you, and include results for those areas when you do things like search.
You can review and delete location and other information saved with your Web & App Activity, or turn it off, by visiting your
Activity Controls
. Turning off Web & App Activity will stop saving your future activity data.
Keep in mind
When you turn off Web & App Activity
You may still have saved activity, which may be used until you delete it. You can delete this anytime. Your saved location information is still automatically deleted after 30 days.
Turning off Web & App Activity doesn’t impact how location information is saved or used by other settings, such as Location History. You may still have other types of location information saved as part of other settings, including IP address.
To see if you’ve turned on Web & App Activity, visit your
Activity Controls

How does Google use location information that is pseudonymous or anonymous?
Google uses anonymized and pseudonymized location information to help enhance people’s privacy. Anonymized information generally cannot be associated with any individual. Pseudonymized information may be tied to a unique identifier, such as a string of numbers, rather than more personally identifiable information such as a person’s account, name, or email address. Anonymized and pseudonymized location information may be used by Google in its products and services for purposes such as advertising or trends.
Users may be able to reset certain pseudonymous identifiers linked to location information. For example, people can reset certain pseudonymous identifiers by resetting advertising IDs on their Android devices. In addition, Google automatically resets certain pseudonymous identifiers to enhance user privacy, including for GLA, the device setting that users can control to improve location-based service and accuracy on their devices.
Separately, Google may use anonymized location information. For example, people can tap on places in Google Maps, e.g., a restaurant or a park, and see trends from those places in an area. Location information used to build trends, like popular times, cannot be used to identify an individual. If Google does not have enough information to provide accurate and anonymous busyness information, it doesn’t appear on Google.
Google also offers people who are signed-out other ways to manage information associated with their browser or device, including the Search customization setting, YouTube settings, and ads settings.

Both Location History and Web & App Activity have auto-delete options, which let you automatically delete data after 3, 18, or 36 months. You can also see this data by visiting Timeline and My Activity, and can delete specific activity or bulk-data according to your preference. You can always modify these settings or change your auto-delete option.
Saving location information:
Depending on the Google product or service, location information may be saved to your Google Account. For example, you may tag locations in Photos, or add a Home or Work address in Maps. You can delete this location information.
When you delete data, Google follows a policy to safely and completely remove it from your account so that the recovery of the data is no longer possible. First, the activity you delete is removed from view and no longer used to personalize your Google experience. Then, Google begins a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from Google storage systems. Learn more about
how Google retains collected data
.
Information that expires after a certain period of time
For other location information, as described in
How Google retains data
, there are times when—instead of being deleted manually—Google stores data for a set time before it’s deleted. The amount of time it takes to safely and completely delete it depends on the type of data, for example:
Google anonymizes advertising data in server logs by removing part of the IP address after 9 months and cookie information after 18 months.
Google deletes IP-based location and device location from your Web & App Activity after 30 days.
Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
As described in the
Google Privacy Policy
, “some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.”

How is location information used for ads?
To help show you more relevant ads
The ads you see can be based on your location information. In general, ads on Google use the same types of location information as the products where they appear. For example, depending on your settings, ads on Search and other Google surfaces might be based on location from your device, your IP address, previous activity, or your home and work addresses from your Google Account. In addition, metadata (e.g., browser timezone, domain, page content, browser type, page language) may be used to estimate your country or a general area you are interested in. We may rely on this metadata in addition to location signals that we get from your IP address, VPN, proxy service, or other network information.
Using location information helps make the ads that you see more relevant to the area you’re in, or to areas that are relevant to you. For example, if your device’s location setting is turned on and you search on Google for restaurants near you, your current device location may be used to show you ads for restaurants near you. Your location may also be used to show you distances to nearby businesses as part of ads on Google.
Google may also use your past browsing or app activity (such as your searches, website visits, or videos you watched on YouTube) and general areas saved as part of the Web & App Activity setting to show you more useful ads. For example, if you search for where to buy milk nearby on Google, you may see ads for grocery stores in the general area where you frequently browse Google Search while waiting for your bus or train.
Advertisers can only target ads to general areas, such as countries, cities, or regions around their business.
For additional information on our Display Network, visit the
Help Center
.
To help advertisers measure performance
Google may also use location information for analytics and measurement to understand how Google services are used. ​For example, if you have chosen to turn on Location History, Google uses this data to
help advertisers estimate
if people are likely visiting their stores because of online ads. Only anonymous estimates, not personal information, are shared with advertisers. To do this, Google connects your online activity data, such as ad clicks, with Location History data related to advertisers’ stores. Your Location History is not shared with advertisers.
To improve Google’s products and services
Google also uses location information to improve its ads products. For example, data about the ads you interact with, including the general area for the relevant activity, that is saved in your account may be aggregated and used in machine learning models that improve
Smart Bidding
tools. Your account data is not shared with advertisers.
How do I control how my location information is used to show ads?
You can control how your general areas where you’ve used Google sites and apps in the past can be used to influence which ads you see by accessing the
Areas where you’ve used Google
control in
My Ad Center
.
When Areas where you’ve used Google are on
When
Ads Personalization
and
Areas where you’ve used Google
are turned on, Google will use the data saved with your Web & App Activity related to the general areas where you’ve used Google sites and apps to personalize your ads.
When Areas where you’ve used Google are off
When
Ads Personalization
or
Areas where you’ve used Google
are turned off, Google doesn’t use the data saved with your Web & App Activity related to the general areas where you’ve used Google sites and apps to personalize your ads. Even when
Areas where you’ve used Google
is turned off, you may still see ads based on your current location and places you’ve set as your home and work in your Google Account.
In addition, if you are signed out, Google may still use your current location from your IP address or from your device to show you ads depending on your device and app settings.
For additional information on how to turn on and off personalized ads when you are signed out, see

Why is human review of my Gemini Apps conversations, feedback, and related data required?
How human review helps improve models
Google uses conversations (as well as feedback and related data) from Gemini Apps users to improve Google services so we can make them safer, more helpful, and work better for all users. These include the generative machine-learning models that power Gemini Apps and technologies that help reduce unintended activations of Gemini Apps. Human review is a necessary step of the model improvement process. Through their review, rating, and rewrites, human reviewers (which include third parties) help enable quality improvements of generative machine-learning models like the ones that power Gemini Apps.
How we protect your privacy in this process
We take a number of precautions to protect your privacy during this human review process:
Conversations (as well as feedback and related data like your language, device type, or location info) that reviewers see and annotate are not associated with any user accounts.
We pick a random sample for such human review, and only a portion of all Gemini Apps conversations are reviewed.
How the process works
Our trained reviewers look at conversations to assess if Gemini Apps’ responses are low-quality, inaccurate, or harmful.
From there, trained evaluators suggest higher-quality responses.
These are then used to create a better dataset for generative machine-learning models to learn from so our models can produce improved responses in the future.
How long is reviewed data retained
Gemini Apps conversations that have been reviewed by human reviewers (as well as feedback and related data like your language, device type, or location info) are not deleted when you delete your Gemini Apps activity because they are kept separately and are not connected to your Google Account. Instead, they are retained for up to 3 years.
How you can control what’s shared with reviewers
If you turn off
Gemini Apps Activity
, future conversations won’t be sent for human review or used to improve our generative machine-learning models.
Don’t enter anything you wouldn’t want a human reviewer to see or Google to use.
For example, don’t enter info you consider confidential or data you don’t want to be used to improve Google products, services, and machine-learning technologies.
Learn more
about how to turn off, manage, and delete your Gemini Apps activity
at any time. Also, you can control Google’s storage of Gemini Apps activity in
My Activity
at any time.
Why does Google retain my conversations after I turn off Gemini Apps Activity and what does Google do with this data?
Google needs these conversations to respond to you and as context for feedback you choose to submit to help maintain and improve Gemini Apps, and to provide all users a safer and better quality experience.
Here are more details about conversations stored with your account even after you turn off Gemini Apps Activity:
Before you give feedback in Gemini Apps
If
Gemini Apps Activity
is off, Google retains your conversations with your account for up to 72 hours. This activity won’t appear in your Gemini Apps Activity and is used to:
Respond to your conversation contextually. For this purpose, Gemini Apps use only 24 hours of data.
Maintain the safety and security of Gemini Apps and improve Gemini Apps. For this purpose, Google needs the 72-hour retention period to help ensure that data from its backend processes is available in case of a potential failure in its systems.
If you turn off
Gemini Apps Activity
, Google does not use your new conversations stored with your account to improve its generative machine learning technologies, unless you submit feedback about a conversation.
After you give feedback in Gemini Apps
If you decide to send feedback to Google, Google’s systems collect the following information:
Your feedback.
Any included content, such as files and images you upload, as well as your personal content that Gemini gets from connected apps.

What does it mean that Gemini is a new and evolving technology?
Gemini Apps (previously Bard) are powered by large language models, as explained in
this overview of Bard
by James Manyika (Google’s SVP, Technology and Society). Like most large language models (LLMs), the models powering Gemini Apps were pre-trained on a variety of data from publicly available sources.
How LLMs work
With pre-training, LLMs find patterns in language and use them to predict the next probable word or words in a sequence. However, if an LLM picks only the most probable next word, responses would be less creative. That’s why LLMs are often given some flexibility. They can pick from a range of reasonable and slightly less probable words to generate more interesting responses.
Why responses aren’t always accurate
LLMs can at times perform well on factual prompts and seem like they’re looking up information, but they're not information databases or retrieval systems. When you query a database, you can expect the same exact response each time. But, when you give the same prompt to an LLM, you won’t necessarily get the same response every time or the actual information that the LLM was trained on. This is because LLMs are trained to predict the next most probable word, not get information.
This is also an important factor in why LLMs can generate plausible-sounding but inaccurate responses about people and other topics. This isn’t ideal when factuality matters, but it’s potentially useful for generating creative or unexpected responses.
Why Gemini Apps are new and evolving
Gemini Apps are part of our long-term, ongoing effort to develop LLMs responsibly. Throughout the course of this work, we discovered and discussed several limitations associated with LLMs, including five areas we continue to work on:
Accuracy:
Gemini Apps’ responses about people and other topics might be inaccurate, especially when asked about complex or factual issues.
Bias:
Gemini Apps’ responses might reflect biases or perspectives about people or other topics present in its training data.
Persona:
Gemini Apps’ responses might suggest it as having personal opinions or feelings.
False positives and false negatives:
Gemini Apps might not respond to some appropriate prompts and provide inappropriate responses to others.
Vulnerability to adversarial prompting:
users will find ways to stress test Gemini Apps further. For example, they may prompt Gemini Apps to hallucinate and provide inaccurate information about people and other topics.
We focused on addressing these areas before launching Gemini Apps. And with the broader field, we continue to research solutions. We at Google are committed to working to improve over time.

.
What happens when I ask Gemini Apps to save info?
Information you’ve asked Gemini to save (for example, “Remember that …”) is used to provide more custom responses in Gemini Apps.
Info is saved until you delete it, and you can turn this setting off at any time.
Learn how to delete saved info or turn off this setting
.
Location & other permissions information
What location information do Gemini Apps collect, why, and how is it used?
Location data is always collected if you use Gemini Apps so that they can provide you with a response that is relevant to your query. For example, to respond to prompts like "What's the weather?", Gemini Apps need to know your location.
Where Gemini Apps get location data & how its used
The source of the location data Gemini Apps collect varies. By default, Gemini Apps use the general area from your IP address or the Home or Work addresses in your Google Account to give relevant responses to prompts like “What’s the weather?”
With your permission, Gemini Apps also process precise location data from your device to provide more relevant responses. For example, Gemini Apps can use your precise location to more accurately respond to prompts like “where is the closest coffee shop to me?”
Google also uses your location data, including your precise location data, for the purposes and based on the legal grounds described in the
Gemini Apps Privacy Notice
. Learn more about location data at
g.co/privacypolicy/location
.
How precise location data is shared
If available, Gemini Apps may share your precise location data with another Google service, like Google Maps, to fulfill your request. The Google service that gets your location data uses it consistent with the
Google Privacy Policy
.
How location data is stored
Precise location is not stored in your Gemini Apps Activity.
Location data that Gemini Apps process is coarsened to a general area before it’s stored with your Gemini Apps Activity. A general area is larger than 3 sq kilometers, and has at least 1000 users so that the general area of your prompt does not identify you, helping to protect your privacy. This means that a general area is typically much larger than 3 sq kilometers outside of cities.
How to control & manage your data

Uploaded files
How do I review and control my uploaded files?
Where you can review your uploaded files
You can review your uploaded files, like images, screenshots, and documents, in your pinned and recent chats in Gemini Apps.
How to control & manage your uploaded files
You can delete your prompts that you uploaded files to in your
Gemini Apps Activity
. Based on where the uploaded files are from, files are either deleted or no longer used to respond to you.
If the file was uploaded from your device,
it’s deleted when you delete the related prompt.
If the file was uploaded from your Google Drive,
it’s no longer used to respond to you in the related chat, but it’s still in your Drive.
How does Google work with my uploaded images?
How images in prompts work
When you add an image to your prompt, or a screenshot using "Ask about this screen," Gemini Apps also use Google Lens technology to understand what's in the image and read the text. For example, Google Lens might interpret an image's pixels as a cat jumping. Gemini Apps add this information to your prompt to understand your request better. Google uses this information just like any other prompt, as explained in the
Gemini Apps Privacy Notice
.
How we limit use of your actual images
At this time, we don't use the actual images you upload or their pixels to improve our generative machine-learning technologies, unless they're included in feedback. If you
submit feedback on a Gemini App response
, the last image uploaded in the same conversation before that response is included as part of your feedback, unless you opt out. Google uses this data like all other feedback you provide.
Learn more about how Google uses your feedback
.
As we provide new features and improve our services, we will be transparent if we use your images differently.
How does Google use my uploaded files?
When you upload a file with your prompt, Gemini Apps can interpret it in connection with your prompt. This may include analyzing that file to provide information about it in a response.
Google doesn’t currently train its generative AI models using your uploaded files, unless you include them in your feedback.
As we provide new features and improve our services, we will be transparent if we use your uploaded files differently.
Generated images

For now, this feature isn’t available to users under 18.
How do I review and control my generated images?

Gemini Apps Activity

How does Google work with my generated images?
Google uses this data, consistent with our
Gemini Apps Privacy Notice
, to provide, improve, and develop Google products and services and machine learning technologies.
When you
submit feedback on responses from Gemini Apps
, Google uses this data like all other feedback you provide.
