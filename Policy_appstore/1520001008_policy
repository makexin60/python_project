The sub-sections entitled “Right Of Access”, “Right To Rectification”, and “Right To Erasure” also apply to users that are located in Canada.
Right Of Access
You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You can access the personal information you have provided as part of your account by submitting a request through our
Support page
.
Right To Portability
You have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., advertising) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., customer support), as described above in the section “How we use your personal information”. You have the right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party, with certain exceptions. We will provide further information to you about this if you make such a request.
If you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (for example, where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).
Right To Rectification
At any time you can update your Account Information by logging in to your account profile on our website. If for whatever reason you believe the personal information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete and requires changes, please notify us through our
Support page
or by using the “How to contact us” section below.
Right To Erasure
You can delete your account and have the right to request that we delete Personal Data that we store on you. You can do this by contacting our
Support page
on our website and requesting your account to be deleted. We ensure that all deletion requests are satisfied within one month upon receipt of your request. Please note that once an account is deleted there is no way to recover it. Some information may be retained by us to the extent we need to satisfy a legal requirement or for security purposes. Some information will also be retained anonymously.
We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defense of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Service and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.
Right To Restrict Processing to Storage Only
You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). As above, where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.
Right To Withdraw Consent
Some of our processing is based on your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time without impact to data processing activities that have taken place before such withdrawal or to any other existing legal justification of the processing activity in question.
Where consent is required to process your personal information, if you do not consent to the processing or if you withdraw your consent we may not be able to deliver the expected service.
Right To Object
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO US PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME WHEN THE PROCESSING IS BASED ON OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS (AND NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, A LEGAL OBLIGATION) ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION. IF YOU OBJECT WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS THERE ARE COMPELLING AND PREVAILING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OR THE DATA IS NECESSARY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL CLAIMS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT US TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES, YOU CAN MAKE THOSE CHANGES ON YOUR DATA PERMISSIONS PAGE

OR CONTACT US ANY TIME VIA E-MAIL AT
privacy@digitalextremes.com

Right To Proceed And To Take Legal Actions

This is without prejudice to your right to launch a claim with the data protection authority in the country in which you live or work where you think we have infringed data protection laws
You also have the right to take legal actions in relation to any breach of your rights regarding the processing of your Personal Data.
Announcements
We may from time to time send you announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (for example, when we temporarily suspend access to the Service for maintenance, or security, privacy or administrative-related communications). You may not opt-out of these service-related announcements, which are not promotional in nature.

Further Rights
Where processing of your Personal Data is either based on your consent or necessary for the performance of a contract with you and processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive the Personal Data you have provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or to have your personal data transmitted directly to another company, where technically feasible (data portability).
Further, you have the right not to be subject to any automatic individual decisions which produce legal effects on you or similarly significantly affects you.
