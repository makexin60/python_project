Your privacy matters to us
We know you rely on us to stay connected to the people and things you care about most. And your privacy is essential when you use our products and services. That's why we’re always working to keep your personal information secure and put you in control of it.
We are committed to protecting your privacy
Where you go on the Internet is your business, not ours
As your Internet Service Provider, we do not track the websites you visit or apps you use through your broadband connection. Because we don’t track that information, we don’t use it to build a profile about you, and we have never sold that information to anyone.
We do not sell information that identifies who you are to anyone
We do not sell your location data
We don’t sell, and have never sold, your location data when you use our Xfinity Mobile service.
We believe strong cybersecurity is essential to privacy
We help protect you with multiple layers of security that automatically detect and block hundreds of thousands of cyber events every second and a team of security experts who work to protect you 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
We give you tools and support to help you stay safe online
We provide Internet customers with free security software and tools, like multi-factor authentication, and give you access to free online tips and advice and an Xfinity security and privacy team to help protect you and your family from cyber threats.
You control your information
The Xfinity Privacy Center offers features where you can download, correct and delete your personal information. You are also able to opt in or out of a number of settings and programs. In addition, if you choose to participate in non-Xfinity programs that require us to provide information that identifies who you are to others, we will do this if you direct us to do so.

California law provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “Personal Information,” rights to access, delete, and correct certain Personal Information we collect about them, restrict us from “selling” or “sharing” certain Personal Information, and limit our use of Sensitive Personal Information, as defined by the law and described in the categories below. These rights apply to all residents of CA, regardless of whether you are a customer, business contact, or member of the workforce. As a California resident, you have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights.
The California Consumer Privacy Act defines “Personal Information” to mean “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.”
You or your authorized agent may submit a request to exercise these rights by visiting our
xfinity.com/privacy/requests
or calling us at
1-844-963-0138
. To opt out of personalized advertising and the sale or sharing of Personal Information, or to set preferences regarding our use of Sensitive Personal Information, please visit the
Xfinity Privacy Preferences Center
and make the appropriate selections in the Settings menu of your relevant devices including X1, Flex, and Xumo TV.
Residents of the State of California also have the right to request information regarding third parties to whom the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes under California's "Shine the Light" law
(Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83)
. Personal Information under this California law means "any information that when it was disclosed identified, described, or was able to be associated with an individual." We do not disclose this type of Personal Information to third parties for their own purposes and we permit you to opt out of any disclosures of non-identifiable Personal Information. However, if you are a California resident and would like to inquire further, please email
Comcast_Privacy@comcast.com.

Collection, use, and retention of Personal Information
The general section of this Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it in categories that are easy to understand. The CCPA requires us to disclose the Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the following categories. Some of the categories include very different types of information within the same category and certain Personal Information may fall into multiple categories. How we use and how long we keep the information within each category will
vary
, and not all types of information within the same category will be used for all the purposes listed.
California law also requires us to provide information regarding the criteria we use to determine the length of time for which we retain Personal Information. We utilize the following criteria to determine the length of time for which we retain Personal Information:
The business purpose for which the information is used, and the length of time for which the information is required to achieve those purposes;
Whether we are required to retain the information in order to comply with legal obligations or contractual commitments, or is otherwise necessary to investigate theft or other illegal activities, to ensure a secure online environment, or to protect health and safety;
The privacy impact on the consumer of ongoing retention, including the consumer's likely expectations in light of the sensitivity of information and our Privacy Commitments; and
The manner in which information is maintained and flows through our systems, and how best to manage the lifecycle in light of the volume and complexity of the systems in our infrastructure.
Individual pieces of Personal Information such as those listed above may exist in different systems that are used for different business or legal purposes. A different maximum retention period may apply to each use case of the information. Certain individual pieces of information may also be stored in combination with other individual pieces of information, and the maximum retention period may be determined by the purpose for which that information set is used.

Maine’s Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act generally prohibits providers of broadband Internet access service (“Providers”) from using, disclosing, selling or permitting access to “
customer personal information
” without a customer’s express, affirmative consent, which may be revoked at any time.
However, no consent is required for the collection, retention, use, disclosure, or sale or access to customer personal information when such activities are required to:
Provide the service from which such information is derived or for the services necessary to the provision of such service;
Advertise or market the Provider's communications-related services to the customer;
Comply with a lawful court order;
Initiate, render, bill for and collect payment for broadband Internet access service;
Protect users of the provider's or other providers' services from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of or subscription to such services; or
Provide geolocation information concerning the customer:
For the purpose of responding to a customer's call for emergency services, to a public safety answering point; a provider of emergency medical or emergency dispatch services; a public safety, fire service or law enforcement official; or a hospital emergency or trauma care facility; or
To a provider of information or database management services solely for the purpose of assisting in the delivery of emergency services in response to an emergency.
A Provider may not refuse to serve a customer who does not provide consent when required or charge a customer a penalty or offer a customer a discount based on the customer's decision to provide or not provide consent.
A Provider shall take reasonable measures to protect customer personal information from unauthorized use, disclosure or access, taking into account the nature and scope of the Provider's activities, the sensitivity of the data the provider collects, the size of the Provider, and the technical feasibility of the security measures.
In addition, a Provider may use, disclose, sell, or permit access to non-CPI, unless the customer opts out.
