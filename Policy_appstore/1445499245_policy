At Resiliens, Inc. we respect your privacy and value the trust you have placed in us. We are committed to the responsible management, use, and protection of your information. This Privacy Policy explains how Resiliens, Inc. (“

,” “
our
,” or “
us
”) collects, uses, and discloses information we obtain through www.Resiliens.co and any products, services, or mobile applications that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “
Services
”).
HEALTH PRIVACY
In providing the Services, we collect and obtain information about individual consumers (“
End Users
”) to, among other things, provide End Users access to a mobile platform for lifestyle, nutrition and eating disorder education and management. In providing the Services, we at times act as a service provider to health care providers (“
Providers
”). A federal law entitled the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, (“
HIPAA
”), safeguards “protected health information” that we create, receive, maintain, or transmit. As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “protected health information” includes any information covered by U.S. federal health laws that we maintain that reasonably can be used to identify an individual and that relates to that individual's physical or mental health condition, provision of care, or payment for such care.
HIPAA limits how we may use and disclose protected health information. We are also required to, among other things, apply reasonable and appropriate measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this information. Some of our Providers may be regulated as “covered entities” under HIPAA. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy is distinct from such Provider's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, which describes in detail how that Provider uses and discloses protected health information. If an End User would like to review a copy of their Provider's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, the End User should request a copy directly from their Provider.
