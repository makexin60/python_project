Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Data.

To the extent applicable, you may also have the right to limit such use or disclosure.

The Enumerated Purposes include the following:
To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services.
To help to safeguard security and integrity of your Personal Data to the extent the use of your Personal Data is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes.
To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at us and to prosecute those responsible for those actions.
To ensure the physical safety of natural persons.
For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a consumer’s current interaction with us, provided that we will not disclose the Sensitive Data, to another third party and will not use it to build a profile about the consumer or otherwise alter the consumer’s experience outside the current interaction with us.

Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by applicable law that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any legally-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonable relate to your Personal Data’s value to use and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
Right to Opt Out of the Sales or Sharing of Personal Data: the right to opt out from the sales or sharing of Personal Data or Sensitive Data to third parties until and unless the sale or share is expressly authorized. As used herein, “share” refers to sharing for purposes of cross-contextual behavioural advertising or targeted advertising, as contemplated under applicable law, such as the CPRA, VCDPA, ColoPA, CTDPA, and UCPA.

When you use a request method above, we will request certain information for verification purposes, such as your name, address, and e-mail address. We will use this information to verify this is a permitted request, such as by matching your name and address with information in our records. Depending on the type of request, we may require a certain number of data points to allow for verification. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Only you, or a person properly authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Data and Sensitive Data. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child, as applicable.
An authorized agent may make a request on your behalf using the request methods designated above. Additionally, if you use an authorized agent to submit a consumer request, we may require the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request. We may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
You may only make a verifiable request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or Sensitive Data or an authorized agent of such person.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identify or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
If we deny your request, you may have the right to appeal our decision under certain laws. Further, if you appeal and your appeal is denied, you may have the right to complain to your state’s attorney general. You may appeal your decision by contacting us at DPO@sram.com.
In accordance with applicable law, we endeavor to respond to a request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we requires more time (up to forty-five (45) additional days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Other California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at:
