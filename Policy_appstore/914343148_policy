Your Access to and Control Over Information
You can do the following at any time by contacting us via our support email address:
See what data we have about you, if any.
Have us delete any data we have about you.
Express any concern you have about our use of your data.
Children
If you are under the age of 18, you must obtain your parent's permission to play our games while online, or use any of our services. If you are under the age of 13 (or 14, 15, or 16 in some locations), you are not permitted to use any of our Services, or play any of our games. All of our games are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 14, 15, 16) and we do not knowingly market to or collect, use or disclose information from children. If NimbleBit learns that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under such age, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such personal information from our records. If you are a parent who wishes to have your child's accidentally collected information deleted, please contact support@nimblebit.com.
Security
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the application, your information is protected both online and offline.
All sensitive information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way using standard web security practices.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email at support@nimblebit.com.
