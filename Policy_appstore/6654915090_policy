Wowoo Ltd.
(“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect, store, use, and disclose your personal information when you use the
NubX: Gender Reveal & Baby Scan
application (“Software” or “App”) and its associated
Service
.
By accessing or using NubX, you indicate that you have read, understood, and agreed to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy. If you do
not
agree with the Policy, please
do not
use the Software and Service.
We reserve the right to modify the terms of this Privacy Policy regarding updates to the Software. You can check the modified version of this Privacy Policy within the Software or on our website. By continuing to use the Software after an updated Policy is posted, you agree to the revised terms.
To help clarify the terminology used in this Privacy Policy, the following definitions apply:
Cookie
: A small amount of data created by a website or app and stored on your device or browser. It is used to identify your browser, provide analytics, remember preferences, or manage login information.
Company
: References to “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean
Wowoo Ltd.
, the entity responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy.
Country
: Refers to the country where the Company is established or primarily operates—in this case,
Turkey
.
Customer
: A company, organization, or individual that signs up to use the NubX Service to manage user relationships or subscriptions.
Device
: Any internet-connected device—smartphone, tablet, computer, etc.—that can download or access NubX and use its functionalities.
IP Address
: A numerical label (e.g., 192.0.2.1) assigned to a device connected to a network that uses Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses can often be used to identify the location of a device connecting to the internet.
Personnel
: Refers to individuals employed or contracted by the Company to support or operate NubX or its associated services.
Personal Data (or Personal Information)
: Any information that allows the identification of a natural person—directly or indirectly—including unique identifiers such as name, email address, or other data that can be used to identify an individual.
Service
: The functionality, software, website(s), and overall service provided by NubX (e.g., gender prediction, image enhancement, subscription-based content).
Third-Party Service
: Advertisers, analytics providers, marketing partners, or other external services that may process data on our behalf or offer content within NubX.
Website
: Our official site, accessible at
https://wowooapps.com/
, related subdomains, or other online properties we use to facilitate or describe our Service.
You
: A user, customer, or individual registered with NubX to use our Service.
We collect two general categories of information: (1)
information that you voluntarily submit
when you use specific functions of the Software, and (2)
information automatically processed
when you interact with NubX.
Ultrasound Images
: NubX allows you to upload ultrasound images for gender analysis (“nub theory”) and baby scan enhancement. Because these may contain sensitive or special-category data, we handle them with heightened confidentiality.
Face Data
: Certain features (e.g., baby look-alike generation) may require face photos. We use artificial intelligence to analyze facial features.
Users provide explicit consent through an in-app prompt before uploading ultrasound images or photos. By proceeding, users agree to our terms of data handling as outlined in this Policy.
Collection & Processing
Images are
only
uploaded or accessed if you grant permission.
In some cases, our AI processing may take place via
secure servers
(i.e., cloud services).
Facial feature information (e.g., orientation or position of facial landmarks) is analyzed for the explicit purpose of generating results, such as predicting gender from an ultrasound or producing look-alike images.
Storage & Retention
We do
not
permanently store face data or ultrasound images on our servers after providing the requested functionality.
Images are only temporarily cached on secure servers for processing. They are permanently deleted or irreversibly anonymized within 24 hours after processing is completed.
Deletion
If you wish to delete any images or have questions about our data handling, please contact us at
hi@wowooapps.com
. We will delete associated data as quickly as technically feasible.
No Sharing with Third Parties
We do
not
share your face data or ultrasound images with any third party, except as required to operate core functionalities (e.g., a secure cloud processing provider). Any such third party is contractually bound to protect and promptly delete the data.
Camera Access
: NubX may request access to your device’s camera for you to take photos in-app. We only use the camera to capture images when you choose to do so.
Photo Album Access
: NubX may request access to your gallery to let you upload existing photos or ultrasound images you select. We
never
collect or analyze any images unless you explicitly choose them within the app.
Camera and photo access permissions are requested solely for the core functionalities of the app, such as uploading ultrasound images for gender prediction. NubX does not access or process any other photos or data from your device without explicit user consent.
This app is designed for educational and informational purposes to provide insights based on nub theory calculations.
This app uses the nub theory, a real calculation method, to predict a baby's gender based on ultrasound images. While the calculation is grounded in scientific observation, results may vary and are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. NubX is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice or diagnosis.
When you use NubX, certain technical data may be
automatically
collected. Examples include:
Device
: Type, OS version, unique device identifiers, language settings.
IP Address
: Used for security and fraud detection, not stored indefinitely.
Software Configuration
: App version, referral URLs, crash data, and performance metrics.
Subscription Events
: Purchase items, subscription duration, order status, payment time (handled via third-party payment processors such as Apple).
Location (Approximate)
: If you allow location access, we may use it for analytics and service improvements.
Advertising ID
: Collected for user analytics or personalized advertising (if applicable). You may reset or disable your device’s ad tracking as permitted by your OS.
We may use trusted third-party SDKs (e.g.,
Adjust
,
Firebase
) or Apple-provided APIs (e.g.,
In-App Purchases
) to process data like subscription events or app usage. We do
not
collect or store complete payment details; any financial data is handled securely by Apple or other payment gateways.
We collect, store, and process the above information for the following purposes:
Operating & Updating the Service
: To provide essential features (e.g., nub theory for ultrasound images, face analysis for look-alike features).
Customization & Development
: To personalize your experience, adapt features, and develop new functionalities.
Analytics & Performance
: To monitor, maintain, and improve the quality and stability of NubX; detect potential fraud; and diagnose performance issues.
Subscription Management
: Processing subscription details (e.g., purchase items, renewal dates) via third-party payment systems.
Communications
: Sending technical notices, product updates, security alerts, or relevant messages (including
push notifications
)—if you consent to receive them.
Legal Compliance
: Complying with legal obligations or responding to lawful requests (e.g., subpoenas, court orders).
If we ever seek to use your data for additional purposes (e.g., marketing or research), we will obtain your explicit consent where legally required.
We do
not
share your personal information except under the following circumstances:
Legal Requirements
: If we are required by law or court order to disclose information, or if necessary to protect the rights and safety of the Company, our users, or the public.
Business Transitions
: If the Company undergoes a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred under similar privacy safeguards.
Third-Party Services
: We may share non-personally identifiable data (e.g., aggregated analytics) with partners providing marketing, analytics, or hosting. These partners must adhere to confidentiality and data protection requirements.
Subsidiaries & Affiliates
: Non-personally identifiable information may be shared within our corporate family, consistent with this Policy.
NubX may include links to or content from external websites, ads, or services (“
Third-Party Services
”). We do
not
control these Third-Party Services and are
not
responsible for their privacy practices. You acknowledge that any use of external services is at your own discretion, and we recommend reviewing their privacy policies before submitting personal data.
Additionally, some third-party advertising networks may collect limited personal information (excluding name, address, email, or phone) to deliver tailored ads. You may opt out through your device settings or by contacting those third parties directly.
Because NubX runs on the internet, your information (including automatically processed data) may be transferred to, stored, or processed in countries outside of your residence. By using NubX, you consent to such cross-border data transfers, subject to any applicable data transfer agreements or legal safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses if you are in the EEA).
We take the security of your data seriously. Measures include:
Encryption
: We use secure channels (HTTPS/TLS) for data transmission.
Firewalls & Access Controls
: Limiting access to data on a strictly “need to know” basis.
Physical & Administrative Measures
: Data is stored in secure facilities with restricted access.
However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We strive to protect your information but
cannot
guarantee absolute security.
With your permission, we may send you
push notifications
regarding product updates, relevant reminders, or promotional messages. You can disable these anytime via your device’s notification settings.
We use
Cookies
and similar technologies to:
Analyze
usage patterns in our App or Website.

While cookies are not strictly necessary for all app functionalities, disabling them may limit certain features. We do

NubX is not primarily directed to children under 13. We do
not
knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 without parental or guardian consent. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please email us at

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will be posted within the Software or on our Website with a new “Last Updated” date.
