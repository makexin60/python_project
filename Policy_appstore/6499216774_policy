Privacy Policy & GDPR
Last updated: November 10th 2022

Become an author
Webdock is not evil and we respect your privacy. Webdock is GDPR compliant and provides supporting documents for further insight into our Data Protection practices. Please see our
Privacy Impact Assessment
,
Third Party Information Sharing
and
Transparency Report
pages in addition to this Privacy Policy.
Webdock has a Data Protection Agreement
available which you can generate/obtain in your Account Area once signed up. In the DPA you can also find contact information for our Data Protection Officer. You can even generate an example DPA for use between you and your clients in case you are reselling our products.
User data
Webdock collects and stores personal information, including the full name, company name and VAT ID (if applicable), billing address,Â email address, and source IP address for all customers. Credit card number and expiration date are stored with a 3rd party (Stripe) and Webdock has no knowledge of your credit card information. We use your personal data to deliver our contractual services to you. Inquiries regarding the collection and use of personal information may be made via email to info@webdock.io.
Your rights under GDPR
Under GDPR you have the right to access personal information that we processes about you.
You can request from us information about
Description
The personal data we hold about you
All the personal data we hold about you can be seen within your account
The categories of personal data concerned
We only require you to provide basic contact information to us; we do not ask you to provide
any "Special category data" as defined by the GDPR
The purposes of the processing
Our legal basis for processing this data is to deliver the contractual services to you
Details to whom your personal data has/will be disclosed
Please see our
Third Party Information Sharing
page
How long we retain your personal data
Please see the "No soft deletion" section of this Privacy policy
You may also request from us the following-
That we update any incomplete or inaccurate data about you
Request that we delete your personal data in accordance with GDPR
You have the access to self serve updating your personal data yourself through your online account.
You can request account closure yourself through your online account, this will delete all data we
store about you other than data that must be kept for legal reasons.
If you have any concerns about your rights or have any questions around this please contact us at
info@webdock.io
No soft deletion
We do not believe in soft deletion. Once you delete a server or account, all data we have stored will be nuked from orbit.
You cannot restore a server once it is deleted as all snapshots we might have had are deleted as soon as the server itself is deleted.
You have about 3 weeks to revive a deleted account.
After which all knowledge we have ever had of you or your servers will be, for better or worse, gone. Account restoration will only be completedÂ against a one-time feeÂ of Euro 250,-. This is not a "fuck you" sort of fee, we actually do need to spend time pulling out data from database backups and manually inject yourÂ data back into our live environment. In this case, it would be much easier to just sign up anew.
There will be some anonymous junk in our Google Analytics logs and other such tracking tools for marketing purposes which will not be deleted, as the material is to the best of our knowledgeÂ anonymised and thereforeÂ harmless.
Please remember we are not a safe haven for criminal behavior, and will report any illegal material found,Â and cooperate fully withÂ law enforcement to the same extent as any other hosting provider would.
Unmanaged Service
Customers bear sole responsibility for maintaining the security of virtual private server (VPS) environments maintained under their accounts. Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with any and all applicable privacy guidelines and regulations for all jurisdictions in which they may operate with respect to appropriate practices for the collection, storage, and dissemination of personal information using their Webdock server. In no event shall Webdock be held liable for a customer's failure to adopt and/or practice appropriate measures for safeguarding personal information stored within or transmitted through their Webdock server.
Security and Data Integrity
Customer information is stored in electronic databases. Webdock employs industry-standard technical safeguards, including but not necessarily limited to encryption of password and/or cryptographic key-based authentication controls on servers which house personal information, browser-based SSL encryption, and other storage system access control mechanisms to protect the integrity of internal databases and prevent unauthorized access. Unless otherwise indicated by amendment to this privacy policy, in which case customers shall be notified and given the opportunity to exercise the "opt out" provisions discussed in this policy, personal information is stored only for use according to the purposes for which it was initially collected.
Third Party Disclosure
Webdock transfers personal information to third parties under the following normal business procedures:
Webdock discloses the full name, billing address, and credit card account information of its customers to a third party merchant processing provider for billing purposes (Stripe). Webdock does not disclose customer information to other third parties except where required under applicable EUÂ laws for purposes of investigation of criminal complaints, or where required by court order. We do disclose your IP address and Name and Email to certain third parties. Please see our
Third Party Information Sharing
page for further details.
Access
Customers have access to all account-specific personal information stored about them via the Webdock web-based interface for account management. Customers may update their information at any time. Customers who cancel their account have ALL theirÂ personal informationÂ deleted from Webdock's databases, with the exception of:
network access logs, which may be stored for any duration of time at Webdock's discretion,
cases where financially fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity is deemed to have occurred (as determined by Webdock management or law enforcement officials), in which case personal information may be retained indefinitely for purposes of ongoing investigation and prevention of fraud recurrence, or
cases where a customer's violation of the Webdock Terms andÂ Conditions has resulted in cancellation of the customer's account (as defined by revocation of the customer's permission to utilize Webdock's services), in which case personal information may be retained indefinitely for purposes of prevention of further use of Webdock's services in the future by the offending individual.
Cookies
We collect anonymous usage information on visitors to our site through use of Google Analytics. This service may employ third party tracking cookies to gather anonymous browser, operating system, geographic, and web site navigation information. Use of the Webdock web-based interface requires the acceptance of cookies for login session management purposes.
Opt Out Provision
Customers shall have the right to opt out of any use of their personal information which is inconsistent with or beyond the scope of the purposes for which it was initially collected. In the event that, at Webdock's discretion, service cannot be continued without customer acceptance of such modifications to the ways in which personal information is collected and/or used, customers who wish to opt out of such collection or use of their personal information will be notified and offered a refund of any positive balance on their account with Webdock.
Enforcement & Applicable law
Please direct compliance inquiries to info@webdock.io.Â This Privacy PolicyÂ and the relationship between you and Webdock shall be governed by the laws of the European Union without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Webdock agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Denmark and the European Union.
Changes
Amendments to this privacy policy may be made at any time and you should check back frequently for any changes. Webdock will never make changes to this policy that result in less protection of your personal information without sending notice.

Privacy Impact Assessment
Last updated: November 10th 2022
gdpr
Information
Become an author
A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)Â is required under GDPR for data-intensive projects, and is a living document which must be made accessible to all involved with a project. It is the process by which we discuss, audit, inventory, and mitigate the privacy risks inherent in the data we collect and process.
Like all GDPR documentation, a PIA can be requisitioned by a data protection regulator in the event of a privacy concern or data breach.
This document was last updated March 2018
1. Data collection and retention
What personal data is processed?
We collect the following data during signup: Name (first and last), Address, City Â and Zipcode, Country of residence, Email, Phone and VAT ID if applicable. In addition we log the IP address of the user.
How is that data collected and retained?
Data is collected using HTML forms and transmitted via an encrypted (SSL) HTTPS connection to a central Webdock server. Here the data is stored in a MySQL database. The user password is encrypted and not known by us.
For how long is data stored, and when is the data deleted?
Data is stored for as long as customers have an active account. If a customer deletes their account, all personally identifiable information is deleted with the exception of certain network and traffic logs which may persist for up to a year. Third party services such as Google Analytics may store data such as IP addresses and website interactions for much longer. Please see our
Third Party Information
sharing page for details on which services we share data with.
Is the data collection and processing specified, explicit, and legitimate?
Yes.
What is the process for granting consent for the data processing, and is consent explicit and verifiable?
Consent is a pre-requisite for signing up with Webdock.
Is the data minimized to what is explicitly required?
We do not gather any more data than required in order to comply with EU law and for the purposes of billing.
Is the data accurate and kept up to date?
We can only verify certain information and do so rarely. Information is kept up to date by the customer themselves.
How are users informed about the data processing?
Users are informed about the data processing through our data protection and privacy policies and notices available on our website.
What controls do users have over the data collection and retention?
Absolute. At any time a user can delete or modify their information.
2. Technical and security measures
Is the data encrypted?
All data is encrypted during transit, but only passwords are encrypted at rest.
Is the data anonymized or pseudonymized?
No.
Is the data backed up?
Yes. Daily.
What are the technical and security measures at the host location?
Stringent security protocols protect the server and running services. Server is continuously kept up to date. Passwords are very secure. Firewall is stringent and tools such as Fail2Ban are implemented. We continuously monitor all activity on the central server.
3. Personnel
Who has access to the data?
All Webdock support staff and engineers.
What data protection training have those individuals received?
Basic GDPR training. Most employees are highly technically proficient and have deep insight into IT security.
What security measures do those individuals work with?
Network and systems monitoring, encryption and more.
What data breach notification and alert procedures are in place?
Automated alerts are set up for unusual activity as seen in system logs. Unusual traffic is logged and flagged to Webdock engineers.
What procedures are in place for government requests?
Standard procedures are in place for such requests, and we have a published
Warrant Canary
4. Subject access rights
How does the data subject exercise their access rights?
By contacting Webdock support at info@webdock.io
How does the data subject exercise their right to data portability?
By contacting Webdock support at info@webdock.io
How does the data subject exercise their rights to erasure and the right to be forgotten?
By deleting their account, or contacting Webdock support
How does the data subject exercise their right to restrict and object?
By contacting Webdock support at info@webdock.io
5. Legal
Are the obligations of all data processors, including subcontractors, covered by a contract?
Yes.
If the data is transferred outside the European Union, what are the protective measures and safeguards?
Webdock utilises several companies to provide us with web analytics services, these companies may store data in the USA. Â These data sets will have very limited amounts of personal data in them, namely IP addresses.Â  Please see our page on
Third Party Information Sharing
6. Risks
What are the risks to the data subjects if the data is misused, mis-accessed, or breached?
Data listed in section 1.1 could be exploited. As we only gather otherwise publicly accessible information, our assessment of the privacy impact is that it is moderate.
What are the risks to the data subjects if the data is modified?
None personally. Malicious 3rd parties may, by virtue of hacking their account, gain access to servers and information therein which is outside the purview of Webdock.
What are the risks to the data subjects if the data is lost?
They may loose access to their account. Unless all backups and duplications of our control backend is lost as well, we will always be able to re-construct a user account. If a user actively deletes their account, or if a malicious 3rd party does so, user data would be lost in the course of 3 weeks, unless we are made aware of this happening.
What are the main sources of risk?
Zero-day exploits of our CMS and/or toolchain which includes but is not limited to: Linux kernel (Ubuntu), Apache/Nginx, PHP, MySQL, SSH and related services.
What steps have been taken to mitigate those risks?
As outlined in sections 2.4 and 3.4 we pro-actively and defensively keep our systems up to date, monitor intensively and review security frequently.
