General Privacy Policy for All Products and Platforms:
Our General Privacy Policy is pretty simple:
We don't collect or record your email or contact information.
We don't resell any contact information we have to other companies or to marketers.
We don't use our apps to track your location, or any personal information about you.
We don't save (or even see) your credit card information.  All transactions are handled securely through the App Store, the Play Store, Windows Store, and any other store that we sell our games through.
We do collect some gameplay data in our games (like play session length, high scores, etc.), but it's entirely used for tuning our games to make them better.
We're also supported by ads from Google AdMob which use your personal advertising identifier to deliver a more personalised experience!
