1. INTRODUCTION
Your privacy is important for Comelit Group S.p.A. We have therefore developed a Privacy Policy concerning the way in which we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your data. We invite you to read this document to learn about our privacy protection criteria and to let us know if you have any questions.
With this document Comelit Group S.p.A. provides you, in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of European Regulation no. 2016/679 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (hereinafter, “
GDPR
”), with certain information relating to the processing of your personal data requested whenever you come into contact with Comelit Group S.p.A. or companies controlled by it in connection with the use of the Comelit website
www.comelitgroup.com
, the services offered by Comelit and the Comelit applications (hereinafter, only App”).
Our Rules on privacy explain:
– Data collected and purpose.
– Mode of use of said information.
– The options that we offer, including the manner of accessing and updating the information.
This document is also drawn up considering the provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC, as updated by Directive 2009/136/EC, on cookies, and the provisions of the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data “Identification of simplified modes for information and the acquisition of consent for the use of cookies” of 8 May 2014 of the recommendations and explanations supplied by Work Group art. 29 in the “
Opinion no.2/2013 on the applications for smart devices
”, and in the “
Opinion 13/2011 on geolocalisation services
”.
2. PROCESSED DATA
2.1 Data necessary for using the website and for using the applications
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a given person, to offer better services to all our customers/users. You might be asked to provide your data whenever you come in contact with Comelit or with a company affiliated to Comelit.
Here are some types of personal data that Comelit might collect, and the respective uses:
Access data collected anonymously
The I.T. systems and software procedures used for the operation of the website and of all Comelit applications, during normal operation, collect some personal data even without the user being registered; the transmission of these data is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols. This is information that is not collected to be associated with identified parties, but which, for its very nature, could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow the users to be identified. This data category includes the IP address or domain name of the device you use, the operating system, the model and make of the device, the mobile phone operator, the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) addresses of the resources requested, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in reply, the numerical code indicating the status of the reply given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters related to the operating system and I.T. environment of your device. These data, collected anonymously through the use of cookies or web beacons, are used only to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the application and of the website and to check that they are working properly.
Data supplied voluntarily by the user
If you choose to register and create your own account for using the site and applications connected to Comelit products, we ask you to send and/or supply some personal information with which you can be personally identified, including your name and surname, e-mail address, year of birth, tax code, account name and password, telephone and postal address, which are necessary for the creation and management of the Users/Customers/users master file (hereinafter
CRM
supported with the
PROCAL
system). The same data are requested for interventions carried out by the technical assistance centre (
SATCO
) and by employees providing assistance for the supply of Comelit services. The user is responsible for the exactness of the personal information sent/supplied to Comelit.
In these cases you will be asked for explicit authorisation for the processing of the data supplied (for example on the registration page, on the intervention sheet or at the time of requesting telephone assistance).
Among the data processed there are also the information, data and videos, collected from your Comelit devices and the respective applications which may be kept, if the service is activated, for a certain period on special Cloud storage units not run directly by Comelit but located in European territory or in countries of which the privacy policy is recognised by the EU.
The data provided voluntarily also include images and videos collected by our customers using Comelit equipment (i.e. door entry monitors, video surveillance systems) whose images, if the facial recognition service is activated, can be kept in absolutely anonymous form and after converting the images into algorithms that do not allow the reconstruction of the original images. The data extracted from the images can be used to compare other images.
We will use the information you provide about your users to enable your device to perform facial recognition. For this purpose, the user must receive a specific notice on the use of the facial recognition system, if active.
Data on position
When Comelit applications and services are used, we could collect and process information on your position and on the position of your systems. If you activated the geolocalisation services at the time of installing the system or application, and if you expressly consented to the processing of geolocalisation data, the applications, when active, will acquire the data on the geographical position of the Comelit system and/or of your appliance (GPS, Wi-Fi, GSM network).
However, you can decide later to deactivate the geolocalisation services of your appliance by accessing the special sector dedicated to localisation authorisation in the operating system of your device (Android or IOS). From that moment it will no longer be able to collect geolocalisation data for the use of the service.
If you did not activate the geolocalisation services at the time of installation, if you did not consent to the processing of geolocalisation data at the time of registration, or if you decide to deactivate the geolocalisation services, you will not be able to use some functions of the applications.
Information that we collect from third parties
We can also collect information on you from third parties, including information from our partners (external SATCO Technical Support Centres, installers, etc.) and from other partners; from social media services (for example, but without limitation, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram) consistently with your settings on said services; and from third party sources. We can add this information to data that we already have in our archives and share it with others based on the policy established in this Note.
The supply of registration data is optional (art. 6 lett. b), e) GDPR), however the failure to supply them may prevent your registration and the use of the functions of the Comelit applications and account, as well as the provision of services (art. 7 GDPR).
Comelit and its affiliates may share these data and use them in accordance with this privacy policy. They may also combine them with other data to supply and improve products, services, contents and advertising materials. You are not required to supply the personal data that we request; however, if you decide not to supply them, in many cases we will not be able to offer you our products or services, or reply to your questions.
The data could be used to ascertain criminal responsibilities, where required by the competent authorities.
3. PURPOSES OF PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS
By legal basis of processing we mean the source/origin/justification of processing after consent of the party concerned in accordance with art. 4 of the GDPR.
3.1 I Your data will be processed:
– for the technical management of the Comelit systems and of the applications;
– for the management of your registration;
– to allow you to use the functions of the applications, including the facial recognition service, with which some door entry monitors are equipped;
– to send you news;
– for marketing activity,
– to fulfil the legal obligations to which the Data Controller is subject.
With relation to these purposes, the legal basis of processing is the execution of a contract in which the data subject is a party, the execution of precontractual measures adopted on the request of the same, or the satisfaction of a request of the data subject.
3.2 Comelit Group S.p.A. will process your data, following your specific consent. With relation to these purposes, the legal basis is the consent of the parties concerned.
Consent to the processing of personal data is purely optional, while it remains understood that, in the absence of such consent, you will not be able to use the services and the applications.
3.3 Comelit Group S.p.A. may also use the user’s information (which may include personal data and videos) for the following purposes.
–
To provide the motion detection function
with push notifications it can use videos in the cloud cache or uploaded by the user to provide the motion detection alarm function to the user with a push notification message. The video in the cloud cache will be saved on the server for no longer than 24 hours.
–
To provide remote access to real-time video or video playback in thecloud
When the user watches a real-time video or video playback, a p2p channel will be configured to transfer the video stream. If errors occur in the setting of the p2p channel, we can use our server to retransmit the data. All streaming data will not be saved on the server.
–
To query the status of the device:
to verify that user access is authorized.
– To provide the facial recognition service: if activated by the customer, the facial recognition function for each door entry monitor system detects the image of the caller; this image can be associated on the customer’s device with a name and/or pseudonym and will be converted into an algorithm saved anonymously on a cloud server. After conversion, the image will be permanently deleted. This algorithm will be retrieved by the device used by the customer for comparison with the images of other video calls.
Personal data
– The personal data that we collect allow us to keep you up to date on the adverts for the latest Comelit products, the software updates and the coming events. If you do not want to be included in our mailing list, you can remove your name at any time.
– We also use personal data to develop, supply and improve our products, services, contents and advertising materials, and to prevent losses and frauds.
– Personal data, including the date of birth, can be used to check the identity, facilitate user identification, and establish which services are appropriate. For example, the date of birth can be used to establish the age of the holders of Comelit ID accounts.
– We can use your personal data periodically to send important notices, such as communications concerning modifications to our terms, as well as to our conditions and policies. Since this information is important for your interaction with Comelit, it is not possible to deactivate the receipt of these communications.
– We can also use personal data for internal purposes, for checks, data analysis and research to improve products, services and communications with Comelit customers/users.
– If you take part in a competition or similar promotions, we can use the data you supply to manage these activities.
