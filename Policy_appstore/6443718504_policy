Supermac’s Ireland Limited Privacy Policy

or in writing to the address supplied at the bottom of this page.
Part One: All visitors to
www.supermacs.ie
are promised that:
Supermac’s Ireland Limited will always respect your right to privacy. However, we understand that the internet is not a secure medium and therefore we have implemented security measures to, where possible, protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information placed under our control.
All data gathered as a result of your website visit or visit to our stores will be treated as confidential.
All orders placed online will be confirmed by email if you have provided an email address responded to via Supermac’s Ireland Limited.

For our ‘customers’, we use your personal data for certain legitimate business purposes, for example, we may ask for your name, address, phone number and email, to tell you about new products and services and to send you marketing communication and offers to use in stores or on our website. We may also send you surveys to help us improve how we service you.
We will consider you as a ‘customer’ for 13 months since the date of your last order. If you do not order within 13 months you will automatically be opted out of receiving our direct marketing.
If you order again from us after 13 months and have not opted out, we have a legitimate interest to re-commence sending you marketing communications about our products and services.
You can opt out of these messages at any time by using opt out feature in all communications or by contacting our team at
privacy@supermacs.ie
We may use personal and profile data to tailor your experience on our interactive services.
We may use your IP address or other identifying information to help diagnose problems with our server, to monitor numbers of users and/or to administer our interactive services as well as to identify and eliminate fraud.
Accordingly, Supermac’s Ireland Limited would encourage you to be cautious about the information you choose to release and to safeguard passwords.
For people who have registered on our website but haven’t yet bought any of our products and services, we will ask for your consent to process your data before we send you marketing offers.
We do not transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area.
We will request that users who wish to submit personal information are aged 16 years or older or that minors obtain permission from their parents or legal guardians before submitting such information.
Whenever we process your personal data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your personal data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing if you wish and if you wish to do so please contact us at
privacy@supermacs.ie
. Please bear in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to carry out the tasks above for your benefit.
Part Three: How long will you keep my data?
We’ll normally hold onto your data if you’re a customer, for as long as is necessary to give you the services you’re using in accordance with our retention policy.
If you don’t use our services or your Supermac’s Ireland Limited account for over 24 months then your account may be classified as dormant and may be deleted in line with our privacy notice and retention policy.
Please check your inbox to see if we’ve sent you any emails about this recently.
