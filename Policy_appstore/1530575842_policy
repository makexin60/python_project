Who We Are
We are Habitics s.r.o., based at Dudova 1, Bratislava, Slovakia (EU). If you have any questions about your data, feel free to reach out to us at hello@nutrilio.net.
What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
The Application does not provide an option to create an account therefore, we do not store nor have access to your entries and data. Your data are stored only locally on your device. You can optionally backup your data to Google Drive (Android) or to Apple iCloud (iOS). Your backups are stored in your private cloud space and we don’t have access to your backup files.
We obtain your email address when you request support via email or customer support contact form. We use your email only to contact you to provide support, feedback or important information.
Backup
We advise our users to regularly back up their data. Our users can choose to manually export the backup file and store it wherever they want or they can optionally make cloud backups. The cloud backups are kept in users’ private cloud space where we have no access.
Android Google Drive Backups
Android users can optionally backup their data using Google Drive. Their backups are stored in their private Google Drive space and count against their quota. We use a secure connection to your Google Account and data is safely stored in a folder where we nor other apps have access. View Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
The email and name permissions within the Android are requested in order to display the account details within the app to inform users about the account which is being used for the backups. The app does not keep email addresses and names within the app. The app asks Google Sign In for a connected account and displays the account info only when accessing the Backup section. Even if the user agreed to anonymous analytics data collection your email address or name is never sent with the analytics data.
iOS iCloud Backups
iOS users can optionally backup their data using iCloud Drive. Their backups are stored in their private iCloud Drive space and count against their quota. iCloud secures your information by encrypting it when it’s in transit, storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication. For certain sensitive information, Apple uses end-to-end encryption. This means that only you can access your information, and only on devices where you’re signed into iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information. You can find out more about iCloud security and privacy overview at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303
AI and Data Processing
Our application uses AI technologies, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, to process and analyze data, such as food photos, to provide detailed recognition results and nutritional information. When you upload a photo, it is processed by ChatGPT to generate insights and recommendations based on the image’s content. Any data shared with OpenAI is handled according to their Privacy Policy: https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/
User Consent
By using the food recognition feature of the App, you consent to ChatGPT processing your data, including photos, for the purpose described above.
