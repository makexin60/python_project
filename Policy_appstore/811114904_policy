B. INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED/ TRACKED WHILE NAVIGATION
Cookies/Local Storage
Cookies/Local Storage are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers’ hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
To improve the responsiveness of the "Product" for our users, we may use "cookies/local storage", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies/local storage to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us via ABP digital properties through your computer/laptop/netbook or mobile/tablet/pad/handheld device etc
Your Freedom to Withdraw Your Consent at Any Time
If you do not wish to accept cookies/local storage in connection with your use of the ABP Platform, you will need to delete, and block or disable cookies/local storage via your browser settings (Please consult your web browser’s Help documentation for more information on this process.) Please note that disabling cookies/local storage will affect the functionality of the ABP Platform, and may prevent you from being able to access certain features on the ABP digital properties.
Opting out
If a user opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID on the user's browser is overwritten with the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can't be associated with a particular browser.

All information gathered on TIL is securely stored within the Company controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable.
