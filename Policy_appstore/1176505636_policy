Do you transfer my data internationally?
Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection (adequacy decision) for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts and/or clause wording approved by the European Commission which gives personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where is my data stored?
We store data in the jurisdictions where we are regulated.
How do you keep my data secure?
We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your data against unauthorized processing, and against accidental loss, modification or disclosure.
Our site has been developed with your personal privacy and security as our prime concern, employing sophisticated means to protect your data, including the strong SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect data going to and from the site, including personal details and any debit/credit card information provided to us. Encryption is used on all of our pages as can be verified by seeing the padlock symbol in the browser address bar. The padlock symbol indicates that SSL is being used and all information sent to and from the site is encrypted.
Several layers of firewalls are in place, together with DDoS mitigation, intrusion protection and prevention mechanisms, anti-malware, data-loss-prevention, anti-spam filters, together providing strong layers of defence to prevent unauthorized access to our servers.
We also deploy Google reCAPTCHA v3 to fight and prevent spam and abuse. The use of reCAPTCHA v3 is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. By accessing or using the reCAPTCHA APIs, you agree to the Google APIs Terms of Use, Google Terms of Use and to the Additional Terms.
Our security landscape is constantly evolving to ensure the highest levels of protection are maintained.
When creating your account with us, choose a secure password. You should keep this password confidential, and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. You can further protect your account by enabling two factor authentication (2FA), providing an additional mechanism to prevent unauthorized access.
For how long do you retain my data?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
By law we must keep basic information about our customers after they cease being customers with respect to their Personal Data: Five (05) years, save for where a customer has self-excluded from the Website, in which case we are required to retain the personal data for seven (07) years from the end of the self-exclusion period, at which point the five (05) year retention period begins. In addition, we retain personal data for longer where required for a legal investigation or litigation.
