Privacy Policy
What information do we collect?
We collect information from you when you register on the site, enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to a survey or communications like e-mails, or participate in other site features.
When you submit a form, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, or other information. You may also visit our site anonymously.
Like many websites, we use “cookies” to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors to our websites. Please refer to the “Do we use ‘cookies’?” section below for information about how we use them.
How do we use your information?
Sign up to receive communications or product updates. When you no longer want promotional e-mail from us, please refer to the “How can you opt-out, remove or modify the information you have provided us?” section below. Visitors who register or participate in other site features like marketing programs and “members-only” content are given a choice to be on our e-mail list and receive e-mail communications from us, or not. We will never send you unsolicited communications.
How do we protect visitor information?
To maintain the safety of your personal information, we implement a variety of security measures. Your personal information is always hidden behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of people with special access rights. We are required to keep the information confidential. All access to your personal information is done on a secure server. All the sensitive information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and encrypted into our databases.
Do we use “cookies”?
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) to enable the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember information. Using them helps us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity. We also use cookies to help us aggregate site traffic and site interaction data so we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. Do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different. Refer to your browser’s Help menu to manage cookies. If you turn cookies off, you will lose access to many features designed to make your site experience more efficient. It’s possible  some of our services will not function properly.
Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?
We will never sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information (PII) information to outside parties unless we provide you with advance notice; except as described below. The term “outside parties” excludes website hosting partners (and other parties) who routinely assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, as long as those parties agree to keep your information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety. Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, and other uses.
How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to us?
Please note that due to email production schedules you may receive any emails already in production. To unsubscribe from emails and communications, please let us know by clicking “Unsubscribe” in any email communication from us or by reaching out to

PTZOptics Products =
Quality + Security
At PTZOptics, our job isn’t just to help you produce spectacular video – it’s also to protect your connections, data, and the integrity of your productions. That’s why we emphasize regular product and firmware updates to guard your privacy and ensure the security of our products. It’s also why we’re always on the lookout for new ways to protect our end users, including monitoring and complying with changes in domestic and international communications and consumer safety regulations related to our products or their applications.
International Security, Safety and Privacy Compliance
Currently, PTZOptics cameras adhere to all regulations established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. As of December 2024, PTZOptics also complies with the European Union’s
General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR)
. Learn more about how PTZOptics products comply with GPSR guidelines
here
.
Additionally, pending rollouts of individual model firmware updates, PTZOptics cameras and controllers will comply with the privacy and security requirements of the United Kingdom’s
Product Security and Telecoms Infrastructure (PSTI) Act
.
These features will be included on the
Move 4K
and
SE
,
Link 4K
,
Studio Pro
,
ZCAM 4K
, and
PT-JOY-G4
and
SuperJoy
joystick controllers during Q1 of 2025.
Securing Your Connection, Data and Privacy in Hive Studio
As a web-based video production and workflow platform,
Hive Studio
is secured in a variety of ways that apply online application best practices.
All-access to Hive and the Hive platform is encrypted using HTTPS. Media connections are established using 256-bit TLS encryption and media streams are encrypted with at least AES-128. All data at rest is encrypted with AES-256, and any retained video stream analytics data and logging is encrypted at rest utilizing AES-256. Assets like Preset Thumbnails, User Profile Photos and Recordings are stored on AWS S3 and are encrypted at rest utilizing AES-256 as well as transferred using HTTPS.
Hive also uses an ultra-resilient, multi-cloud infrastructure. Underlying providers were selected for industry-leading security and data protection policies. Critical infrastructure such as databases are protected behind a firewall and a bastion, preventing remote access without secure access. Database and Application Runtimes are managed by Amazon and auto-patched to ensure up-to-date security patches.
Maximizing Hive User Security
On the user side, Hive allows for secure personalization of access by requiring complex passwords with special characters for all accounts. Users also have the option of activating multifactor authentication, and organization administrators can enforce multifactor authentication for anyone with access to their organization or studio.
Users can only receive invitations to join a studio from an Admin, while other roles such as Producer and Viewer cannot invite potentially unwanted users into the studio. Admins can easily delete, manage and set expirations for user access to a studio, and expiring invitations allow Admins to automatically disable Studio access for users at a specific date and time.
Telehealth Visit Privacy
Recognizing that privacy is an integral part of the telehealth experience, PTZOptics has also included on the Move 4K a Privacy Mode setting that automatically turns the camera away from the user, allowing patients to “close the door” of the virtual examining room and ensure the practitioner sees only what is necessary for the consultation. Privacy Mode is coming soon to other G3 cameras.
Continuous Care Through Firmware Updates
At PTZOptics, we’re committed to providing the most secure and reliable experiences for all of our products. Part of that commitment is constant improvement through regular firmware updates. For the SuperJoy, Move 4K, Move SE, Link 4K, and Studio Pro, check for new firmware through each item’s web interface. To make sure other products’ firmware is up to date, check out our firmware utilities
