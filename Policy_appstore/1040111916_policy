Thank you for visiting our website.
Your privacy is important to us. We provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
History Today Ltd owns and operates

. All the information you give will be treated as confidential and is stored in a secure server, with only authorised individuals approved by History Today Ltd having access.
Collection and use of your details
The types of information that may be collected via the registration and purchase transactions include: name, postal address, e-mail address and credit card information.
This information we gather will be used in transaction processes, to fulfil any other requests for our products, programs and services, and used to update you on any important changes to the website and its functionality.
We will only collect the information we will need to provide a service you have requested. This is particularly true of sensitive information, such as telephone numbers and credit card details. As a general rule, we don't collect customer telephone numbers.

Purchase transaction details
To complete purchase transactions History Today Ltd. will use credit or debit card details, and billing or delivery address information provided by you.
A security method called Secure Socket Layer (
SSL
), encrypts all ordering information so that no part of your order - including your name, address, and credit card number - can be read by a third party. Consequently, your credit card number is safer when you order online through SSL than when you make a credit card purchase in a restaurant or a store!
Details are passed directly to our merchant bank, RBS WorldPay (part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group). The details are not recorded by our website hardware, or by staff. RBS WorldPay operate their own
