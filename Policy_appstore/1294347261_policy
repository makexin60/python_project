Our website includes applications called social plugins linked to various social media (LinkedIn, X, YouTube) which allow us to offer you content recommendations. When you load a page from our site containing one of these plugins, your browser connects directly to the servers of the social media site concerned. The social media site then transmits the content of the plugin directly to your browser, so that it is incorporated into the webpage.
