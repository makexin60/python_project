The platform provider largely determines the purposes and methods of data processing, which we can only influence to a limited degree.
Any data you enter on our social media pages, such as comments, videos, pictures, likes, or public messages, is published by the social media provider and is not used or processed by us for any other purpose. We reserve the right to delete content if necessary. We may share your content on our website if it is a function of the social media platform, and we may communicate with you via the platform.

In some situations, different entities may work together to jointly determine the purposes and means of processing your data. In these cases, there is what is known as joint controllership.

We only share your information with recipients when there is a valid legal basis for the data transfer, and when appropriate data transfer mechanisms are in place.
