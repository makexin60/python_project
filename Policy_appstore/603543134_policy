Recruitment and Criminal Data Processing
From time to time we will advertise on our website vacancies which may arise. For the recruitment and selection we will require personal data to determine a pool of suitable applicants. See
more information on data processing for recruitment
.
Due to the nature of our organisation, we carry out criminal background checks in instances such as before we offer positions to those who may have to work with children or other vulnerable groups, apply for certain RAD memberships or when you apply to one of our courses. In order to carry out such checks we will engage with a third-party company called
Due Diligence Checking Ltd
. We do this to ensure the vital interests of our students and other legal obligations such as safeguarding.
You can review our
Criminal Record Checks and Recruitment of Ex-offenders Policy
More information can be found in the separate department privacy policies. If you have any questions or concerns about this you can contact us using our details mentioned above.
Children
We are particularly concerned to protect the privacy of children. We are confident that our systems and processes are designed to be fair to children, to protect their rights and freedoms, and to be fully in line with their reasonable expectations and those of their parents. We take responsibility for identifying the risks and consequences of processing children’s data. Sometimes we may need to check your age, which might mean we need to contact your parent or guardian.
Safeguarding
The RAD has a statutory and moral duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children, young people and vulnerable adults receiving education and training with us. More information can be found in our
Safeguarding Policy & Procedures
.
Who has access to your information and data sharing
The RAD does not sell, rent or buy your information to or from other organisations.
We will not release your information to other organisations unless in exceptional cases when we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.
Also due to the nature of our organisation departments within RAD may share your data with each other to help fulfil orders, answer queries or help with educational aspects with your time with us to name as a few examples. This may also involve data sharing with other RAD offices across the globe. Where data sharing is required we ensure there is a legitimate purpose to do so and we have consulted with our Data Protection Officer.
Transferring your information outside of the UK/EEA
As mentioned above, due to the nature of our organisation there may be instances where we may need to transfer your data outside the UK. We may need to share your data with other RAD entities or companies who are in the European Economic Area (The EU member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), in an adequate listed country or in other third countries who may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. If we need to transfer your information outside the UK we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Notice.
Third-party service providers
We make certain personal information available to third parties who provide services to us. We do so on a ‘need to know basis’ and in accordance with data protection legislation. Where we do use third-party service providers we will ensure they have the appropriate data processor/data sharing agreement in place and the agreements contain the appropriate clauses as well.
A
list of third-party service providers
can be found on our website.
Recognition and accreditation
If you apply for a university-validated programme, your personal information will be shared with the validating university and government agencies, such as the Higher Education Statistics Agency, as and when required. Please read HESA’s Privacy Policy.
The RAD is recognised to award qualifications on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) in England by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual), in Wales by Qualifications Wales, and in Northern Ireland by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). The RAD is also recognised to award qualifications on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF), by SQA Accreditation, a part of the Scottish Qualifications Authority.
The RAD is validated by the Council for Dance, Drama and Musical Theatre (CDMT) as an awarding organisation.
We may be required to submit data which includes personal information to one or more of the named organisations in order to comply with their conditions of recognition, maintain the RAD’s status as a recognised awarding body and for quality assurance purposes.
The RAD also offers GCSE, AS and A Level Dance. In order for students to be entered in for their examination, we are required to share their full name, date of birth, gender and UCI and ULN number with the exam board AQA. This personal is requested by the exam board and no further details are shared. For more information on how your information is used, please see their Privacy Notice.
In addition in order for students to be approved for access arrangements (special requirements in order to sit exam e.g. extra time), we are required to share their full name, date of birth, gender, UCI and ULN number and evidence of SEND requirements with JCQ. For more information on how your information is used, please see their Privacy Notice.
Marketing & Communications
The RAD has a marketing department (based in the UK head office) who help carry out promotional activities in order to promote and communicate updates, events and news from the RAD which may be of interest to you. We carry out marketing through various means such as through our websites, online social media channels, emails, digital ads and hardcopy to name a few examples. We ensure we capture an individual’s consent before contacting them with any marketing campaigns and individuals have the ability to opt out whenever they choose to do so.
With your consent, we will use your email address and phone number to send you the latest news and information that we believe may be of interest to you and in accordance with your stated preferences, via email, sms or whatsapp. We use Dotdigital to send our communications.
When we send you marketing communications, we monitor whether you have opened the communication and clicked on any included links. This will enable us to track and analyse your level of engagement/interest in the communication we are sending you and will provide us with further insight on what type of communications are most of interest to you.
If you agree to marketing, and later change your mind, you can opt out at any point, by amending your preferences. If you do not wish to receive any marketing email communications at all, you can use the ‘Unsubscribe’ link at the end of the electronic communications, but this will unsubscribe you from all marketing email communications. Updating your preferences will, instead, allow you to select which kind of content you do or do not wish to receive.
The RAD marketing department will regularly refresh marketing lists in order to ensure those who have opted out are no longer contacted. The RAD marketing department might also from time to time ask you to update your preferences to ensure you continue to get content that’s relevant and meaningful to you.
We may occasionally include third-party content from our corporate partners, if we think the content will be of interest to you, according to your marketing preferences. For example, this could include sending a discount offer for a product or service offered by one of our corporate partners, or some information about an exhibition or event managed by other organisations.
Marketing from Royal Academy of Dance Enterprises ltd (RADE) trading as the Royal Academy of Dance official shop
With your consent, we will include in our comms information from RADE about their merchandise, offers and events. If you change your mind, you can update your preferences and remove this option.
For more information, you can contact us at
info@rad.org.uk
.
Social Media Platforms
If you engage with the RAD on any of our social media channels you should know that we do not collect your personal information it remains within the platform that we are using and so you should familiarise yourself with their privacy notices and policies: Facebook, Tik Tok, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube. The Royal Academy of Dance may use information you provide to share updates, news and events, in the form of customised online advertising. If you send us a direct message, your information still remains within the platform unless we ask you to provide us with your contact details to continue the conversation offline or privately, and you consent to do that.

All Dance Studies teachers/freelancers requiring contact with young people and vulnerable adults will need to comply with the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, and any subsequent legislation, to ensure they will not be putting at risk young people or vulnerable adults in their care. For UK residents, this is likely to include an Enhanced Disclosure by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) or equivalent, applications for which they are made on their behalf by the RAD or a designated umbrella organisation.
Dance Studies will not carry out background checks of teachers/freelancers, however, we will require you to have carried these out before confirming employment with us. We will require you to have carried out an Enhanced Background Check every year in which RAD Human Resources (HR) will send to you the relevant instructions and requirements. RAD HR will not share the result of the checks with Student Activities (or any other third party) but will verify when DBS is issued to confirm suitability of employment with Dance Studies.
How long is your information kept?
We review how long we keep personal information on a regular basis. We are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations. We hold your personal information on our systems for only as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract or agreement you hold with us.
Data Security
The Royal Academy of Dance takes data security very seriously. We will ensure personal data will be kept safe and secure against any instances (including but not limited to) loss, misuse or alteration. If we become aware of any instances where personal data may be compromised in any way, we will work closely with our IT team, DPO and other parties as necessary to investigate the incident at hand. We have put into place the relevant procedure and policies in place to investigate, mitigate and report (when needed to relevant parties) such instances.
Third parties and Data Transfers
Dance Studies uses third-party processors where needed to carry out certain activities for us. These third parties can be found here. Some of these third parties may be based outside the UK/EEA. Where such data transfers do occur we will ensure the appropriate data transfer agreement is in place.

Questions or Concerns
If you have any questions or concerns about this notice you can contact
development@rad.org.uk
Effective Date: 01/01/2023
1. Introduction
1.1 The Royal Academy of Dance, including the Examinations Board, is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy, and to processing personal information fairly and lawfully.
1.2 This policy explains, in respect of RAD examinations:
how we collect personal information
what type of information we collect
why we collect it
the legal basis for processing the information
how we use the information
how long we keep it
when and how we may share it with others
how we keep it secure
your privacy rights and how the law protects you
1.3 In respect of its functions as an awarding organisation delivering examinations and awarding qualifications, the Royal Academy of Dance is a data controller. This means that we determine the purposes and means of processing the personal data we need to collect in order to carry out these functions.
1.4 The information in our database is set up so that a teacher (or school administrator) acts as a data collector (e.g. obtains the candidate information with the agreement of the candidate or relevant parents/guardians), and then this information is held in our database under the other joint controller – the school.
The RAD and the School listed in the database are joint controllers of this candidate data.
Therefore, where a teacher leaves a school, they may not be entitled to view, remove or adjust candidate data, as this would belong to the school, rather than the individual who submitted the information. If a teacher leaves a school, they can register students under a new school. The administrator for a school should keep their student record up to date, and remove students who no longer attend. A former teacher of a school cannot request that student data of the former school is deleted or adjusted – this would be the responsibility of the school administrator.
1.5 Where teacher’s or other relevant individuals (e.g. school administrators/applicants), collect candidate data for the purpose of entering a candidate for an RAD examination, they should make the candidate, and their parents/guardians aware that their data is being held in the RAD database, and refer them to this privacy policy for more detail on the retention and use of this data.
1.6 We only use personal information if we have a valid reason to do so. This includes sharing information outside the Royal Academy of Dance.
2. How do we collect information about you?
2.1 We may obtain information about you when you:
complete an exam entry, registration or other relevant form (e.g. reasonable adjustment, special consideration, complaint or appeal), or someone else, such as a parent, school administrator or teacher, completes it on your behalf;
speak to us on the telephone or in person (or someone else, such as your teacher, speaks to us);
email us (or someone else, such as your teacher, emails us);
make a payment;
complete a survey;
or participate in an event or examination that is photographed or recorded on video.
3. What type of information is collected?
3.1 The personal information we collect may include
for teachers, school administrators, and applicants:
your title, name, address (including correspondence address, email, telephone number and where relevant, additional information for secure delivery of exam certificates and medals), phone number (including mobile or emergency contact number), and email address; the name, address, phone number, email address, and website address of your school or examination location
for examination candidates:
your name, date of birth, gender, ULN (Unique Learner Number), emergency contact details and previous examination results, footage of the candidate performing their examination
for examination candidates:
optional ethnicity data, which the RAD requests and uses to inform and develop its Ethnicity and Diversity policy and procedures.
for examination candidates:
detail about personal circumstances which would form the basis for an application for a bursary.
for examination candidates in respect of reasonable adjustment and special consideration applications only:
health or special educational needs and disability information.
3.2 Some of this information may have been collected previously by the RAD, for example when you were first registered for an exam or became a member. In such cases, we are collecting it for verification purposes only. Where this is not the case, we may update our database with the information provided.
4. How is this information used?
4.1 We may use this information to:
register a school or exam location for the purpose of accepting examination entries and delivering examinations
register candidates for examinations, assign them an RAD ID number, and maintain a database of such candidates together with their examination record
receive and process examination entries, and schedule candidates for exams
process examination fee payments
contact you about your examination entry
deliver examinations, process results, and award qualifications to successful candidates
deliver certificates, result forms and medals securely to teachers for distribution to their students.
mark, standardise and moderate examinations
make reasonable adjustments to exams procedures to remove barriers for candidates where this is possible
make special considerations to candidate examination results where applicable
seek your views or comments on the services we provide
notify you of changes to our services
send you communications which you have requested
handle an enquiry, complaint or appeal you have made
contact you in an emergency situation
assist in the quality assurance of an examination or training and standardisation of examiners
inform the decision-making process for the Fiona Campbell Examinations Bursary
inform and develop our Equality and Diversity policies and procedures
review and improve our services
5. What is the lawful basis for processing the information?
5.1 The lawful basis for processing the information is set out in any relevant privacy notice at the point where we collect the data. The bases we use are Consent and Legitimate Interest.
5.2 Where the lawful basis for processing this data is consent, this is the delivery and awarding of qualifications and assessments for candidates taking examinations in dance. We consider that the processing is necessary to achieve this purpose, benefits the individuals whose personal data we process, is fully in line with their reasonable expectations, is not objectionable or intrusive, and does not open them to any undue vulnerability or negative impact.
5.3 Where the lawful basis for processing information is stated as consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, although such withdrawal may mean that the RAD cannot process your examination.
5.4 If you are providing medical or health-related information, we must have the consent of the candidate or their parent/guardian if under 18 to receive and hold such information. In the absence of such consent, we will not be able to receive the information and may not be able to process the application.
5.5 Where the lawful basis for processing this data is Legitimate Interest, this is using filmed exam footage for internal quality assurance and standardisation of examiners, including trainee examiners. Footage is only viewed by RAD examiners, trainee examiners and relevant administrative staff, and is held by the RAD. We consider that this processing is necessary for the essential business function and quality assurance of the RAD and the exams service it provides to its candidates and teachers. We consider that this is fully in line with reasonable expectations, is not objectionable or intrusive, and does not open them to any undue vulnerability or negative impact.
5.6 Where the lawful basis for processing data is Legitimate Interest, you have the right to object at any time. Email
exams@rad.org.uk
for more information.
6 How long is the information kept?
6.1 We review how long we keep information on a regular basis and update our retention schedule accordingly. We are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations. We hold personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant privacy notice at the point where we collect the data. In addition, candidate data regarding qualifications and results is held in our database as an accurate educational record. Footage of examinations is held for as long as this data is relevant or applicable for quality assurance and standardisation purposes, and at the point at which it becomes irrelevant to the quality assurance of the services provided, will be deleted.
7. Who has access to your information?
7.1 We DO NOT sell or rent your information to other organisations, or buy or rent information from other organisations.
7.2 We may pass your information to third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors or other associated organisations. This is only done when stated in any relevant privacy notice and for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf which are consistent with the original purpose of collating and processing the data. An example of this is to a mailing house or delivery company to send you examination results and certificates.
7.3 When we do this, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have an agreement in place that requires the third party to keep your information secure and not to use it for any other purpose.
7.4 We use an RAD Examiner Marking App to capture examination marks for candidates. This is a purpose built app, held on an RAD iPad. Candidate data is added to the app from the RAD online exams database. Once added to the app, the relevant examiner will be able to see this data to award the candidate marks during their examination. The data cannot be seen by non-relevant staff. Once the marking is complete, the data is transferred back to the database. The data is deleted from the examiner’s view in accordance with the RAD retention schedules (6 months, to allow for queries about results, complaints or appeals). The Marking App has undergone a DPIA to ensure security.
7.5 We use a third party provider, MailChimp, to deliver some e-communications (such as Focus on Exams). We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies simply to help us monitor the use of and improve our ecommunications. This information is not used to identify customers. For more information, please see MailChimp’s Privacy Policy. You can choose to unsubscribe from our ecommunications at any time by clicking ‘unsubscribe’ in the footer of the email.
7.6 We use a third party provider, SurveyMonkey®, to run surveys and collect feedback from our customers (such as the teacher feedback survey at www.surveymonkey.com/r/examsfeedback). If you choose to provide your name and contact details when completing such a survey we will only use these to contact you about the survey, and will only keep your personal information for a stated duration (communicated at the time of completing the survey). If you choose to remain anonymous we will not contact you but will use your responses to inform our analysis of the feedback we receive.
7.7 We may use a third party scheduling provider, Doodle (or ‘doodle poll’), to offer a prebooking request service for examination dates. Where used, we will only use the personal information you provide for the stated purpose and will only keep it for the stated duration (communicated at the time of completing the doodle poll) which is likely to be the timeframe within which the scheduling will be completed.
7.8 The RAD is recognised to award qualifications on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) in England by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual), in Wales by Qualifications Wales (QW), and in Northern Ireland by CCEA Regulation, part of the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). The RAD is also recognised to award qualifications on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF), by SQA Accreditation, a part of the Scottish Qualifications Authority. The RAD is validated by the Council for Dance, Drama and Musical Theatre (CDMT) as an awarding organisation.
We may be required to submit data which includes personal information to one or more of these organisations or to other awarding organisations in accordance with a regulatory directive, in order to comply with their conditions of recognition, maintain the RAD’s status as a recognised awarding body, or for quality assurance purposes. However, this is rare, and in most cases data is submitted in an anonymised form.
7.9 We use a third-party delivery company, Postal Logistics International, to distribute certificates, results forms, medals and corresponding letters. Postal Logistics use trusted delivery companies to fulfil the secure delivery of certificate and medal packages (DHL, SmartTrack-C, Linex, Royal Mail, Parcelforce). Personal information will only be processed and stored for the stated purpose, and deleted once this purpose has been fulfilled. Applicants who enter candidates for examinations should note that their personal details (including correspondence address, email, telephone number and local tax ID (where applicable)) as provided to us may be included on packaging/address labels on the exterior of packages in order to enable swift and secure delivery of the contents.
7.10 For further information on filmed examinations and the way that this data is captured, retained and deleted, please see Filmed Examination Guidelines for Teachers and associated documents – these can be found in the Members’ area, or for non-members, by emailing and requesting copies – exams@rad.org.uk
7.11 Other than as set out above, we will not release information to other organisations unless in exceptional cases when we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.
8. Social media
81. If you engage with the RAD on any of our social media channels you should know that we do not collect your personal information; it remains within the platform that we are using and so you should familiarise yourself with their privacy notices and policies: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube. If you send a message it may be directed to the Examinations Department for response. Your information will remain within the platform unless we ask you to provide us with your contact details to continue the conversation offline or privately, and you consent to do that.
9. Children
9.1 We are particularly concerned to protect the privacy of children. The vast majority of our examination candidates are children (2 – 18 years old) and we need to collect their personal data in order to deliver examinations and award qualifications to them. We are confident that our systems and processes are designed to be fair to children, to protect their rights and freedoms, and to be fully in line with their reasonable expectations and those of their parents. We take responsibility for identifying the risks and consequences of processing children’s data.
10. Your choices and rights
10.1 You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. If we ask for your permission to receive communications about the work of the Royal Academy of Dance and our products, services and events, you can select your choices by ticking the relevant boxes on the form on which we collect your information.

11. Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information
11.1 When you provide us with personal information, we take the necessary steps to ensure that it’s stored and treated securely. The RAD’s website is built in HTTPS. The principal motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the information exchanged while in transit; so you can be assured that any personal information that requires extra security (such as credit or debit card details) is encrypted and protected using industry standard security measures, including the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, via email for example, and you do so at your own risk.
11.2 Once we receive your information, we make all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. We work with third party developers and system hosts who meet international security standards including anonymisation scripts.
11.3 Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
12. Financial transactions
12.1 Where you use your credit or debit card to pay for a service, we will ensure that this is carried out securely and in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). You can find more information about this standard here. We do not store your card details for use in future transactions and if you give us your card details over the phone we will not repeat these to you in response to confirm them. We use third party providers Sage Pay and Global Payments to securely process and store financial information, and we advise you to read their privacy policies.
13. Transferring your information across international borders
13.1 The RAD is a global organisation. As part of the services offered to you, the personal information which we store and process may be accessed by Royal Academy of Dance offices in countries around the world. By submitting personal data, you agree to this. We will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken at all times, in order to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy.
13.2 Where filmed footage of candidates is taken to allow our Panel of Examiners to mark the examination, applicants, candidates, parents/guardians/carers should be aware that this footage can be marked by any one of our Panel of Examiners worldwide, and therefore that the data (footage) can be sent from any one area/country to another for this process to take place. All footage is encrypted and password protected, and all members of the RAD Panel of Examiners are trained on the confidential nature of the data, and the way it should be processed, retained and deleted once the marking has been completed. Email
exams@rad.org.uk
if you have any further questions or concerns on this issue.
14. Photography and video recording
14.1 Examinations or ‘mock examinations’ may be recorded on video, including:
as a choice by the RAD teacher.
where examinations with an examiner visit are made impossible due to global events (e.g. pandemic, civil unrest etc.).
they are Solo Seal examinations.
an examination or day of examinations could not take place at the scheduled time and it proved impossible or impractical to reschedule.
an examiner was not available to conduct examinations.
it was not possible to show a section of an examination on the day and it was agreed that this could be submitted on video at a later date.
an enquiry or complaint was made about an examination result and we invited filmed footage of the candidate(s) to be supplied in order to help us resolve the complaint.
video footage of ‘mock examinations’ was required for the purposes of examiner training, standardisation, quality assurance, and/or controlled comparability studies with other dance awarding organisations.
14.2 Participants/candidates or their parent/guardians should complete the relevant consent forms (generated automatically in RAD Online Exam Entry when the exam entry is made) and RAD Teachers/applicants should retain these for the period until the finalised results have been received and results and certificates sent out, after which they should be deleted.
14.3 We use Planet eStream to upload any such footage. Planet eStream is a secure streaming platform. Teachers can request a login to upload footage, and the software with create a secure link for viewing by relevant staff. Only the teacher and staff with appropriate permissions will be able to see this footage.
14.4 Additionally, the examinations department sometimes uses photography and video recording of individuals for the purposes of external marketing and communications. (Actual examinations will not be used for this purpose). In these instances it will be necessary for participants or their parent/guardian to complete a consent form, which is accompanied with a Privacy Notice and details of how the images and/or footage will be used and for how long they will be retained.
15. Questions and complaints
15.1 Any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, our Privacy Notices, or our privacy practices should be sent by email to exams@rad.org.uk or you can phone +44 (0)207 326 8073.
