UK Hays app Privacy Policy
Uk Hays app
privacy policy
INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Policy explains what we do with your personal data when you sign up for and use our digital platform app, and related services (the "
Hays App
"). The Hays App is designed to provide a range of services to
Work Seekers
.
If you use the Hays App in connection with browsing, finding and undertaking assignments (for example, if you browse the Hays App, sign up for assignment alerts or if you accept an assignment through the Hays App), then you will be a "
Work Seeker
" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, as we explain in more detail in the section "
Types of Work Seekers
" below.
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and process your personal data in connection with the Hays App, and how, in doing so, we comply with our legal obligations to you. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting and safeguarding your data privacy rights.
This Privacy Policy applies to the personal data of users of the Hays App.
For the purpose of applicable data protection legislation (including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (either or both, the "
GDPR
")), the company responsible for your personal data ("
Hays
" or "
us
") can be found
here
.
It is important to point out that we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check this page from time to time as we will post any changes here.
If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of our Privacy Policy, you may have legal rights and, where relevant, we have described these as well.
When you use the Hays App as a
Work Seeker
who is a
Registered User
or a
Fast Assignment User
(each as further described below) it is also important that you understand that you are registering not just for services provided through the Hays App but also for other services provided by, and interactions with, Hays outside of the Hays App as a Candidate, (as the term is used in the
Hays General Privacy Policy
) and/or any other relevant category of individual referred in the
Hays General Privacy Policy
, including Temporary Worker (for example, we may send you marketing materials). How we use your personal data in this context is set out in full in the
Hays General Privacy Policy
, and we have provided further information on the types of circumstances where we may do so in the relevant areas of this Privacy Policy.

THE PRIVACY POLICY
How do we collect your personal data?
When you use the Hays App, we collect your personal data in the following ways:
Directly from you: We ask you to provide personal data as part of the registration process (although we may already hold some of this data where you have previously registered with Hays, as further described below). Then, depending on how you want to use the Hays App, we may need to ask you for further personal data to provide these services to you (for example, to enable you to create a profile, or so that we can send you assignment alerts).
From your use of the Hays App/from our profile of you: As you use the Hays App we will gather information about you to form a profile of you based on your use of our services (see "
Profiling
" below).
From third parties: We may also gather information about you from your profile on other social media and professional networking platforms, and from other third parties, such as assignment boards. We may also gather information about you from third parties who provide certain functionalities of the Hays App. For example, we may be provided with information by these third parties in order to manage your assignment, or if you access training resources via the Hays App which are provided by third parties, we may collect information about you and any feedback given by you or about you from those training providers. If you access discounts provided by third parties, we may collect information about how much you have saved from those third parties. Please also see further the ‘Use of third parties’ section below. If you have worked for one of Hays' client organisation before or are currently working for a client organisation, we may also collect information about you from those client organisations (such as feedback and timesheet information).
From our internal
Systems
: Where you have previously registered with Hays on a digital platform previously provided by Hays (for example, Hays Hub or Hays Workspace) or otherwise previously interacted with us, then we may already have your details on our
Systems
. We may use this information we hold about you to enhance your experience of using the Hays App by doing things like pre-populating certain information fields when you complete our sign-up process.
What kind of personal data do we collect and how do we use it?
We will need to use certain types of personal data about you in the course of providing you with services via the Hays App. We describe each of the situations in which we use your personal data (and the types of personal data that we use) below.
Types of Work Seekers
There are three different types of users who may use the Hays App. Which type of user you are will determine what services are available to you and what personal data we collect about you. These types of users are:
Browsing Users
: These are
Work Seekers
who have downloaded the Hays App but who have not signed up for an account. The services/ functionalities available to a
Browsing User
are more limited. If you apply for an assignment as a
Browsing User
, an account will be created for you and you will be invited to login to the Hays App as a
Registered User
.
Registered Users
: These are
Work Seekers
who have downloaded the Hays App, created an account (or had one created) and logged in to the Hays App.
Fast Assignment User
: These are
Work Seekers
who are invited to use the Hays App as a
Fast Assignment User
. These individuals are invited to become
Fast Assignment User
as they are suitable for assignments that require quick fulfilment (known as fast assignments), e.g. where compliance checks on these individuals have already been carried out.
Fast Assignment Users
may also apply for other assignments, and so all services and functionalities on the Hays App are available to
Fast Assignment Users
.
Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy or the context requires otherwise, references to assignments includes references to fast assignments.
Sign-up process
Where you are registering with the Hays App as a
Work Seeker
, we collect data that you provide during the sign-up process such as name, email address, phone number and home address (or we may obtain certain elements of this from our Systems as described above).
Provision of Hays App Services
Depending on how you want to use the Hays App we may also need you to provide additional information. In particular, you will need to provide additional personal data which may include your employment-related information in order for us to provide these services to you.
We also collect and otherwise process technical information about the devices that you use to access the Hays App and related software, hardware and peripherals, in each case to improve the Hays App and the related services. This technical information includes your IP address (including approximate location data (e.g. country/ locale) using geographic information from your IP address), device identifiers, device name/type, MAC address, and mobile carrier information.
In addition to the above location data, we may also collect information about your location for certain Hays App services which make use of location data sent from your devices. You can turn off this functionality at any time by turning off the location services settings for the Hays App on the device. If you use these services, you acknowledge our and our affiliates' and licensees' transmission, collection, retention, maintenance, processing and use of your location data and queries to provide and improve location-based products and services, such as alerting you to local assignment opportunities, the location of the nearest Hays' office or nearby places where you can use your discounts. You may stop us collecting such data at any time by turning off the location services settings on for the Hays App on the device. If you do so, this might preclude your use of some functionality of the Hays App
We also collect additional types of data in respect of different Hays App services and your interactions with them, as set out in the following tables, where you can also find the legal basis that we rely upon to process this data. See also the section headed
Our legal bases for processing your data
below to find out more about these legal bases.
Please note that certain services set out in the tables below might not be available to you when you use the Hays App. This is because certain services are only made available to:
certain types of
Work Seeker
e.g. certain services are only available to
Registered Users
and

who have secured an assignment and are currently working in a role; and/or

We also collect other personal data about you not listed above in connection with a
Client
's use of services or platforms related to the Hays App, such as any information a
Client
may tell us about you in connection with an assignment or otherwise. The legal basis that we rely upon to process this personal data will depend on the nature of the personal data provided to us. However, this will usually be the legitimate interests lawful basis as further described in the section headed "
Our legal bases for processing your data
"
For completeness, the Hays App also provides a link to the relevant app store to download the Hays Timesheets app for those users to submit timesheets and carry out other related activities where applicable. The details of processing of personal data in connection with this Hays Timesheets app is governed by the relevant privacy policy set out in the Hays Timesheets app.
Provision of other services
As described above, where you have registered for, or use, the Hays App, as a
Work Seeker
, we may also use your personal data to deliver other services to you outside of the Hays App in accordance with the
Hays General Privacy Policy
.
To help us establish, exercise or defend legal claims
In more unusual circumstances, we will use your personal data to help us to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. The personal data that we will process will depend upon the nature of the legal claim in question but will include your name and details of the claim as they relate to you. The legal basis that we rely upon for this processing is the 'establishing, exercising or defending legal claims' lawful basis as further described in the section headed "
Our legal bases for processing your data
"
Marketing
We will periodically send you information which we think you may be interested in, either via Hays App messages and notifications, or by e-mail. This may include information about:
the Hays App such as new services;
other Hays products and services which you may be interested in;
third party products and services which you may be interested in, such as training courses; and
details of reports, promotions, offers, networking and client events, and general information about the industry sectors which we think might be of interest to you.
This usually involves the processing of your name, email address, telephone number and details of your marketing preferences.
We need your consent for some aspects of these activities which are not covered by our legitimate interests (in particular, the delivery of direct e-marketing of our services to you via e-mail). We will sometimes ask for this consent via soft opt-in, which means we will take your consent as given when you sign-up for the Hays App unless you object or opt out (and we will remind you of your right to do this in each e-marketing message that we send to you). For other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent. Consent is further described below in in the section headed "
Our legal bases for processing your data
".
We may also send you marketing materials in accordance with the processes set out in the
Hays General Privacy Policy
.
Profiling
Profiling is a type of processing activity which involves our use of information that we collect about you in order to build a "profile" about you. In the tables above we explain what personal data we collect to build a "profile" about you. This helps us to get a better idea of what you're like and your interests, likes and dislikes, all of which enable us to provide the best possible service to you. We rely on the legitimate interests legal basis to carry out this processing, namely we consider it is in our and your legitimate interests to provide you the best possible service that is relevant to you. This legal basis is further described below in in the section headed "
Our legal bases for processing your data
".
Here's how we use profiling:
Personalisation
We want to ensure we communicate with you in the best way possible, and to optimise the information we provide to you through our services, website and online presence. In order to do this, we use profiling methods which involve analysing your personal data in order to better understand you and your interests, habits and preferences. An example of how we might do this is that when you click on something on our website, we take note of this as perhaps an indication of what you are interested in looking at. We use profiling methods to place you and your user profile into groups or segments with other Hays App users, based on your interests, habits, attributes and/or preferences so that we can:
send you personalised emails (which, for example, might reflect what we think are your preferences);
make recommendations for editorial content that we think may be of interest to you (e.g. reports about developments in your industry);
send you tailored or more relevant marketing communications (the contents of which may, for example, reflect how you have responded to or interacted with previous marketing communications from us); and
recommend relevant third party training courses to you based on your assignment interests.
Improving your experience of our services outside of the Hays App
We may want to use information that we find out about you when you use the Hays App in order to improve your experience of the services that we provide to you outside of the Hays App.
As referred to above, where you use the Hays App we may also use your data for services outside of the Hays App, as a
Work Seeker
, we carry out a number of profiling activities that are set out in our
Hays General Privacy Policy
and we will use information that we collect about you via the Hays App as part of these profiling activities.
Our legal bases for processing your data
Legitimate interests
Article 6(1)(f) of the
GDPR
is the one that is relevant here – it says that we can process your data where it "is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by [us] or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights or freedoms of [you] which require protection of personal data".
We don't think that any of the following activities prejudice individuals in any way – in fact, they help us to offer you a more tailored and efficient service, (for example, by using profiling methods to personalise your experience with us and our communications with you) so everyone's a winner! However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. If you would like to know more about how to do so, please refer to the right to erasure.
We consider the following to be non-exhaustive examples of processing activities that are in our legitimate interests to carry out in the context of the Hays App:
facilitating sign-up to the Hays App;
facilitating the provision of Hays App services to
Work Seeker
; and
for our internal administrative purposes, such as facilitating payroll and invoicing processes.
Consent
In certain circumstances, we are required to obtain your consent to the processing of your personal data in relation to certain activities. Depending on exactly what we are doing with your information, this consent will be opt-in consent or soft opt-in consent.
Article 4(11) of the
GDPR
states that (opt-in) consent is "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her". In plain language, this means that:
you have to give us your consent freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;
you have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;
you should have control over which processing activities you consent to and which you don’t. We provide these finer controls within our privacy preference centre; and
you need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – we're likely to provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.
We will keep records of the consents that you have given in this way.
We have already mentioned that, in some cases, we will be able to rely on soft opt-in consent in order to market products or services to you which are related to the Hays App services or services outside of the Hays App that we provide to you unless you actively opt-out from these communications. We will, at other times, obtain your explicit consent in relation to our marketing activities in connection with the Hays App or otherwise.
As we have mentioned, you have the right to withdraw your consent to these activities. You can do so at any time, and details of how to do so can be found
here
.
Establishing, exercising or defending legal claims
Sometimes it will be necessary for us to process personal data and, where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, sensitive personal data in connection with exercising or defending legal claims. Article 9(2)(f) of the
GDPR
allows this where the processing "is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity".
This will arise for example where we need to take legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are required by law to preserve or disclose certain information as part of the legal process.

When we refer to "meaningful contact", we mean your active use of the Hays App or more generally as a Work Seeker (or a Candidate under our
Hays General Privacy Policy
) even if not related to the Hays App (for example, if you use other services provided outside of the Hays App). Your receipt, opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us, will not count as meaningful contact – this will only occur in cases where you sign into the Hays App or any other service through which you interact with us, where you have asked us to keep you signed-in, access and interact with the Hays App or such other service.
In determining the appropriate retention period for different types of personal data, we always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data in question, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of that personal data, the purposes for which we need to process it and whether we can achieve those purposes by other means (in addition of course to ensuring that we comply with our legal, regulatory and risk-management obligations, as described above).
How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us?
One of the
GDPR
's main objectives is to protect and clarify the rights of EU and UK citizens and individuals in the EU and UK with regards to data privacy. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below.
To get in touch about these rights, please contact us. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we will, where necessary, keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise. Please also note that where you make a request, we will action your request in relation to your personal data that we have collected and otherwise processed in connection with the Hays App and all other personal data that we may hold about you on our internal
Systems
as someone who has previously registered with Hays. By way of illustration, if you request for your personal data to be erased, we will erase all personal data that we hold about you, not just personal data that we have collected and otherwise processed in connection with your use of the Hays App.
Right to object
This right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following four reasons: (i) our legitimate interests ; (ii) to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority; (iii) to send you direct marketing materials; and (iv) for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.
The "legitimate interests" and "direct marketing" categories above are the ones most likely to apply to users of our Hays App. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless:
we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or
we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.
If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity.
Right to withdraw consent
Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (including soft opt-in for marketing purposes), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.
Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR)
You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or
Delete
such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is "manifestly unfounded or excessive". If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.
Please note that in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject access requests and may refuse your request in accordance with such laws.
Right to erasure
You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria:
the data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed them;
where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing;
the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in a manner which does not comply with the
UK GDPR
);
it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller; or
if we process the data because we believe it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests, you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.
We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:
to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;
for public health reasons in the public interest;
for archival, research or statistical purposes; or
to exercise or defend a legal claim.
When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will
Delete
the relevant data.
Right to restrict processing
You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either one of the circumstances listed below is resolved: (i) you consent is obtained; or (ii) further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important United Kingdom, EU or Member State public interest.
The circumstances in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are:
where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you. In this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified;
where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. Here, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data;
where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it; and
where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.
Right to rectification
You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.
Right of data portability
If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your Hays account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we will directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies to: (i) personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention); (ii) personal data provided by you; and (iii) personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to fulfil a contract.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Details of how to contact them can be found
here
.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your personal data), details of how to contact us can be found
here
. Please note that we will, where necessary, keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.
You may ask to unsubscribe from temporary assignment alerts and other marketing communications from us at any time. Details of how to do so can be found
here
.
It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the period for which we hold your data.
How do we store and transfer your data internationally?
So you want to know more about how we store and transfer your data internationally? In order to provide you with the best service and to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, your data will be transferred:
between and within Hays entities; and
to the third parties referred to in the "Who do we share your personal data with" section.
Some of the data that we hold about you in connection with the Hays App will be stored on, and synced with, our internal
Systems
that we also use to provide you our other services outside of the Hays App. We refer to this data, which includes contact information such as your name, email address, phone number and home address as "core data". This means that if, for instance, you update an item of your "core data" via the Hays App, it will also be updated on our wider
Systems
. We will process this data in accordance with both the terms of this Privacy Policy and the
Hays General Privacy Policy
.
Some of the other data that we hold about you in connection with the Hays App will only be maintained in the Hays App. We refer to this data, which includes information such as the types of assignments you are looking for and your availability as "operational data". This will not be synced with our wider Systems. We will process this "operational data" in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy alone.
We want to make sure that your data are stored and transferred in a way which is secure. We will therefore only transfer data outside of the European Economic Area or EEA (i.e. the Member States of the European Union, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) or the United Kingdom where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data, for example:
by way of data transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or approved under the laws of the United Kingdom for the transfer of personal data by data controllers to data controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws;
transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the United Kingdom under UK adequacy regulations in respect of that country's levels of data protection via its legislation;
where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract; or
where you have consented to the data transfer.
To ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate procedures with the third parties we share your personal data with to ensure that your personal data is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the law on data protection.
Who is responsible for processing your personal data when you access the Hays App?
You can find out which Hays entity is responsible for processing your personal data and where it is located by following this

If you have any comments or suggestions concerning this Privacy Policy please follow this link. We take privacy seriously so we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
What are cookies and how do we use them?
The following section is relevant only where you are using the Hays App to access a web browser (for example, where you click on a link in the app taking you to the Hays website or third party website), and not more generally to your use of the app.
What's a cookie?
A "cookie" is a piece of information that is stored on your device's hard drive and which records your navigation of a mobile app so that, when you revisit that app, it can present tailored options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes.
Cookies are used by nearly all mobile apps (and websites), and do not harm your system. If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings on your device.
If you do not want to receive cookies that are not strictly necessary to perform basic features of our Hays App, you may choose to opt-out by changing your browser settings on your device.
Most browsers will accept cookies but if you would rather we didn’t collect data in this way you can choose to accept all or some, or reject cookies in your device's privacy settings. However, rejecting all cookies means that you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Hays App's features. Each device is different, so check your device settings to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
For more information generally on cookies, including how to disable them, please refer to aboutcookies.org. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your device.
How do we use cookies?
We use cookies to:
ensure the Hays App and its features run properly, such as allowing you to apply for a role via the Hays App;
remember your previous visits or choices you have made to help personalise your return visits and improve your experience using the Hays App; and
help us track your use of the Hays App. This enables us to understand how you use the Hays App and track any patterns that emerge individually or from larger groups. This helps us to develop and improve the Hays App and services in response to what our users want and need.
Cookies are either:
Session cookies: these are only stored on your deviceduring your browsing session and are automatically deleted when you close your mobile app – they usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a mobile app without having to log in to each page but they do not collect any information from your device; or
Persistent cookies: a persistent cookie is stored as a file on your device and it remains there when you close your mobile app . The cookie can be read by the website or app that created it when you visit that app again. We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics and for personalisation (see below).
Cookies can also be categorised as follows:
Strictly necessary cookies:
These cookies are essential to enable you to use the Hays App effectively, such as when applying for a role, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on our Hays App cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.
Performance cookies
: These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our Hays App. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the Hays App are most popular.
Functionality cookies:
These cookies allow our Hays App to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of the Hays App that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.
Personalisation cookies:
These cookies help us to advertise details of potential assignment opportunities that we think may be of interest. These cookies are persistent (for as long as you are registered with us) and mean that when you log in or return to the Hays App, you may see advertising for assignments that are similar to assignments that you have previously browsed.
The table at
Annex 3
lists the cookies we use in your jurisdiction, why we use them and what types of cookies they are.
Third party cookies
The Hays App may contain links to other independent websites and to third party services which are not provided by us, including training and other resources offered by external providers, and to services offered by external advisors.
If you access any of these third party websites, the relevant third party may drop cookies onto your device. The cookies used by these third parties are not under our control, and we have not verified as to whether the relevant third party that use them have complied with applicable legislation in respect of their use of such cookies.

Hotjar
We use the following services provided by Hotjar Ltd: Heatmaps, Visitor recordings, Funnels and Form Analysis, Feedback Polls and Surveys and Recruiters. Heatmaps show anonymously where users click on a webpage, with red showing the “hottest” areas. Visitor recordings show users actually using the website, collating where the user moves and clicks the mouse. Any personal information is anonymised. Funnels can be used to see where we lost most of our visitors. Forms allow us to analyse exactly where on a form, e.g. on which field, users are stopping and no longer filling in the information. It helps to identify fields that are confusing or causing concern to visitors. Incoming feedback allows us to capture live feedback from users about the website. Feedback polls and surveys give us the facility to create pop-up polls and surveys on different webpages. We can create a set of questions and give users a selection of pre-created answers or a free text box. Recruiters allows us to ask our visitors for their help directly on our pages. We can invite them to a live user test via screen sharing (e.g. via Skype) to truly see how they use our pages and what they are thinking. The information generated by the tracking code and cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Hotjar on servers in Ireland.
Hotjar uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and showing website operators how users are using the website and what feedback they have. Hotjar uses a variety of services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics and Optimizely. These services will collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request. For information on how Google Analytics and Optimizely collect and use your information, please refer to their privacy policies which are located

GLOSSARY
Browsing Users:
These are Work Seekers who have downloaded the Hays App but who have not registered for an account.
Client
– refers to those who use the Hays App in the course of their employment at one of Hays' clients.
Delete
– In this day and age it is virtually impossible to guarantee the permanent and irretrievable deletion of electronic data. In addition, as we have explained to you in this Privacy Policy, sometimes we will be obliged by law or regulation, or need for risk-management reasons, to retain the ability to access certain elements of personal data. However, our commitment to you is that once your personal data reaches the end of its nominal retention period, or where we receive a valid request from you to erase it, we will put in place specific operational and Systems measures to ensure that your data is "put beyond use". By this we mean that while the data will still technically exist on an archive system, we will ensure that it cannot be readily accessed by any of our operational Systems, processes or staff. Only a very (and we mean exceptionally) small number of senior staff, in very (and, again, we mean exceptionally) limited and carefully prescribed situations, will be able to restore your personal data so that it can be viewed for those legitimate purposes. Once we are clear that all relevant legally mandated retention periods have expired (which, for present purposes, we expect to be the period of seven years), we will go the additional final step of undertaking a "hard delete", whereby not even that very limited number of senior staff would be able to restore your personal data.
Fast Assignment Users:
These are Work Seekers who have been invited to become Fast Assignment Users and use the Hays App because these Hays has identified that these individuals are particularly suited to being placed in certain types of assignments, known as fast assignments.

Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and process your personal data, and how, in doing so, we comply with our legal obligations to you. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting and safeguarding your data privacy rights.
This Privacy Policy applies in respect of the personal data of the following categories of people:
Candidates
,
Temporary Workers
,
Clients
,
Suppliers and Third Parties
,
People Whose Data We Receive
,
Website Users
,
Staff Alumni
, and
Visitors
.
If you are:
a member of Hays' Staff, you should refer to the Hays' Staff Privacy Policy which is available on the Hays Intranet; or
seeking employment with Hays internally, you should refer to the
Recruits Privacy Policy
.
We are subject to applicable data protection legislation including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “
GDPR
”), and the UK GDPR.  Please note that when we refer to the GDPR throughout this Privacy Policy, we are referring to both the GDPR and UK GDPR.
The company responsible for your personal data (“
Hays
”, “
we
” or “
us
“) can be found
here
.
It is important to point out that we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please just visit this page if you want to stay up to date, as we will post any changes here.
If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of our Privacy Policy, you may have legal rights and, where relevant, we have described these in this document.
How to Use This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy tells you a few things about how we use your personal data, and perhaps more importantly, what your rights are in relation to this (you have, for example, the right to ask us to delete or confirm the nature of information that we hold about you at any time, withdraw any consents that you may previously have given and/or lodge a complaint with our Data Protection Officer or a supervisory authority if you are not happy about something we have done).
The Privacy Policy is broadly divided into two sections:
Context-specific privacy information that applies to the different categories of person covered by this Privacy Policy, as follows:
Candidates
Temporary Workers
Clients
Suppliers and Third Parties
People Whose Data We Receive
Website Users
Staff Alumni
Visitors
General privacy information that applies to all of the different categories of people covered by this Privacy Policy, including:
Who do we share your personal data with?
How do we safeguard your personal data?
How long do we keep your personal data for?
How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us?
Who is responsible for processing your personal data when you access the Hays website?
How do we store and transfer data internationally?
Cookies Policy
Use of third party services
This Privacy Policy applies in relevant countries throughout our international network. Different countries may approach data privacy in slightly different ways and so we also have country-specific parts to this Privacy Policy. You can
find
country-specific provisions for your jurisdiction
here
. This allows us to ensure that we're
complying with all applicable data privacy protections, no matter where you are.
This Privacy Policy also contains a number of defined terms (which we distinguish by starting them with a capital letter), so we have included a
Glossary
at the end of this document.
Context-Specific Privacy Information
Candidates
This section of the Privacy Policy applies to Candidates.
Candidates include individuals with whom Hays has not had prior contact, but whom Hays reasonably considers would be interested in, or might benefit from, Hays’ services and being considered for any roles advertised or promoted by Hays including permanent, part-time and temporary positions and freelance roles with Hays' Clients (including those individuals who want to become Temporary Workers). Candidates also include applicants for such roles as well as people who have supplied a speculative CV to Hays not in relation to a specific job and/or who have engaged with Hays about Hays’ services and/or any roles advertised or promoted by Hays. Individual contractors, freelance workers and employees of suppliers or other third parties put forward for roles with Hays' Clients as part of an MSP offering or otherwise will be treated as Candidates for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

Pre-recruitment Activities
When conducting pre-recruitment activities, we use your data to work out whether you might be interested in, or might benefit from, our services, and to assess whether and how we might be able to assist you. If we think we can help, we will use your contact details to get in touch with you and find out if you are interested in our services (usually via email), subject to any applicable laws and requirements.
In order for us to do this, we may:

Store your details (and update them when necessary) on our database so that we can contact you about our services;
Send you an email to inform you about our processing of your personal data and to direct you towards this Privacy Policy;
Review your information to work out whether and how our services might help you; and

We've set out in more detail below various ways in which we will use and process your personal data for the purposes of determining whether our services would be beneficial to you, where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements. Please note that this list is not exhaustive.
In most cases, we will use your personal data for the purposes below if we deem it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests. Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it “is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights or freedoms of you which require protection of personal data.”
We don't think that any of the activities in relation to which we rely on the legitimate interests condition prejudice Candidates in any way. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. If you would like to know more about how to do so, please refer to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the
General Privacy Information
section of this Privacy Policy.

Marketing Activities
We will periodically send you information that we think you may find interesting, or to ask for your help with connecting other Candidates with jobs. In particular, we will use your data for the purposes listed below, where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements. Please note that this list is not exhaustive.
We need your explicit opt-in consent for some aspects of these activities or soft-opt-in (which we explain further below). Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding consenting to receive marketing materials. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click
here
.
Soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies where we have obtained your contact details from an occasion when you previously engaged with us (for example by informing one of our consultants that you are interested in our services, submitting a job application or CV, or registering a vacancy to be filled), and we are e-marketing or sending by text message other recruitment-related services of our own. Under ‘soft opt-in’ consent, we will take your consent as given unless or until you object or opt out (and we will remind you of your right to do this and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out, in each e-marketing message that we send to you). For most people, this is beneficial as it allows us to provide you with information that we think will be of interest to you and suggest other jobs to you alongside the specific one you applied for, significantly increasing the likelihood of us finding you a new position. We will use your personal data to send you e-marketing materials with your ‘soft opt-in’ consent if we deem that it is in our legitimate interests to do so.
For other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent. If you are not happy about our approach to marketing, you have the right to opt out or withdraw your consent at any time and can find out more about how to do so by referring to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the
General Privacy Information
section of this Privacy Policy. Nobody's perfect, even though we try to be.

Why and how we process your information
Types of personal data used
Legal basis relied upon
Preserving, sharing and otherwise processing Candidate data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
The actual information used depends on the factual circumstances, but could include any of the following:
Key identification and contact information
Education and employment information
Special category information
Criminal conviction data
Financial information
Automatically collected information
Information that others provide about you
Additional information that you choose to tell us
Legitimate interests, namely it is in our interests to seek and receive legal advice should we need it and to protect ourselves in the context of litigation and other disputes
In the unlikely event that we need to process any special category information or criminal conviction data for this purpose, we will only do so where local law allows us to process such data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making
Profiling is a type of processing activity which enables us better to understand the information that we collect about you, to help us to develop a personalised “profile” for you. This helps us to gain a better idea of how you like to interact with us and our services, the sorts of requests you like to make of us and, of course, the sorts of things you don’t like.  The purpose of our building this personalised profile is to enable us to provide the best possible service to you and maximise the chances that we will be able quickly and efficiently to provide you with access to content that is most likely to be relevant and helpful to you.
We will use profiling methods in relation to your personal data if we consider this is necessary for our legitimate interests as detailed in the table below. If you are not happy about this, in certain circumstances you have the right to object and can find out more about how and when to do this by referring to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the
General Privacy Information
section of this Privacy Policy.
We also sometimes use automated systems such as filtering tools, or occasionally more complex tools which use an element of artificial intelligence, such as algorithms or machine learning (including those provided by third parties), to help us quickly, efficiently and more accurately to analyse data we have about you and other Candidates, as well as data we hold on our Clients' needs, and this ultimately helps us to make decisions based on this data. This can include applying tools which use algorithms (such as filtering tools or machine learning) to Candidate personal data in order to help us come up with the best possible shortlist for a particular role. Such technology should reduce significantly the amount of time needed to consider when Candidates might be the best fit for relevant jobs. This should in turn make the recruitment process much more efficient and effective, which, we hope, will improve your overall experience with us.
As new and better technology becomes more prevalent, some of our profiling activities and our processing activities which use automated systems such as those described above, may amount to Automated Decision Making within the meaning of Article 22 of the GDPR. This means a process of making a decision by automated means with limited, or even no, human intervention in reaching the decision. We will only use automated decision making in relation to your personal data where we consider this is necessary for the completion of pre-contractual steps taken at your request.

If these shortlisting and ranking activities amount to Automated Decision Making for the purposes of Article 22 of the GDPR, we will only conduct these activities where we deem this to be necessary for the completion of pre-contractual steps taken at your request.  We think it is reasonable to assume that, as a Candidate, you are hoping to enter into an employment contract, and that by using our services you are asking us to take the necessary steps for this purpose. Such steps might include, for example, checking you meet certain requirements for a particular role. If the role is very popular, we may have to check the eligibility of a large number of potential Candidates – we may therefore use automated decision making to filter this pool of Candidates down to a more manageable number.
Compliance with a legal obligation
In some circumstances, we will use your personal data to comply with our legal obligations. Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it “is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which (we) are subject”.

Depending on the type of personal data in question and the grounds on which we may be processing it, should you decline to provide us with such data, we may not be able to fulfil our contractual requirements or, in extreme cases, may not be able to continue with our Temp Relationship.
How do we collect your personal data?
If we employ or engage you as a Temporary Worker directly, we collect your data (in addition to the data already collected about Candidates) in the following ways:
Personal data that you give to us; and
Personal data that we receive from other sources.
Below are some more details about each of these methods.
Personal data you give to us
Hays needs to know certain information about you in order to fulfil our obligations to you, to ensure that you are properly fulfilling your obligations to us, and to ensure that we are both fulfilling our obligations to others. This information will enable us to operate a usual Temp Relationship, along with all that entails.
There are numerous ways that you can share your information with us in addition to the information you share as a Candidate. Where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements, these may include:
when you complete registration forms at the beginning of our Temp Relationship; or
in meetings or communications with your consultant, our HR team or other colleagues.
The types of information that we receive from you in this way include:
Temporary worker information; and
Special category information,
as described in the section entitled “What Kind of Personal Information Do We Collect?” above.
Personal data we receive from other sources
We also receive personal data about you from other sources. Depending on the relevant circumstances and applicable local laws and requirements, these may include personal data received in the following situations:
if you were referred to us through a recruitment agency or other work agencies, they may have shared personal information about you with us;
information obtained about you from third party service providers who undertook background checks about you on our behalf at the start of our Temp Relationship;
your colleagues may share personal information about you with us;
medical professionals may (in appropriate and limited circumstances) share personal information about you with us;

To ensure the smooth running of our Temp Relationship, including all of the activities that need to be undertaken in a usual relationship of that type, such as:
facilitating payroll and invoicing processes, if relevant to your jurisdiction;
determining the terms on which you work during your Temp Relationship;
keeping a record of any promotions, salary rises or bonuses you are awarded; and
Assessing your performance.
Some more detailed information about the way in which your data is processed can be found in the
Recruits Privacy Policy
. For example, during the on-boarding process with Hays, Temporary Workers will be treated in a similar way as recruits for Hays roles and their personal data during the recruitment process for such roles will be processed in the ways described in the
Recruits Privacy Policy
. Depending on the applicable local laws, we appreciate that you are not a 'Recruit' in the sense of that Policy but given that we use the data in a similar way, for the same purposes, we thought you wouldn’t mind having a quick look at that policy if you were interested in a greater level of detail.

Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it “is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.”
Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it “is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights or freedoms of you which require protection of personal data.”
We don't think that any of the activities in relation to which we rely on the legitimate interests condition prejudice Temporary Workers in any way – in fact, they help us to offer you a more tailored, efficient service. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. If you would like to know more about how to do so, please refer to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the

Why and how we process your information
Types of personal data used
Legal basis relied upon
Collecting and processing data in the course of and to the extent necessary to facilitate the Temp Relationship, including by:

Special category information
If you have entered into a Temp Relationship with us, we will rely on the performance of a contract legal basis to the extent that the processing activity that we are seeking to conduct is necessary for the purposes of the contract that we have entered into with you
We will otherwise rely on legitimate interests, namely it is in our interests and your interests for us to facilitate the Temp Relationship
If we need to process your special category data (e.g. details of any sickness absence including health-related information), we will process your personal data in this way if we have a legitimate interest in and it is necessary for us to process your data for health and social care purposes and local laws allow us to process your data in this way without obtaining your consent. If local law requires us to obtain your consent, we will do so.
Sharing of data
If we employ or engage you directly as a Temporary Worker, we may share your personal data with a number of additional parties in order to ensure the smooth running of our Temp Relationship. For example, we may share your personal data with appropriate colleagues within Hays (this may include colleagues in overseas offices), with a Client and, if appropriate, medical professionals such as your GP or an occupational health specialist (for instance, for the purpose of any work adjustment assessments if applicable).
We will generally rely on the same legal bases referred to in the section addressing Temp Relationship Activities above depending on the context.

We will use profiling methods in relation to your personal data if we consider this is necessary for our legitimate interests as detailed in the table below.

This means a process of making a decision by automated means with limited, or even no, human intervention in reaching the decision. We will only use automated decision making in relation to your personal data where we consider this is necessary for the completion of pre-contractual steps taken at your request.

PEOPLE WHOSE DATA WE RECEIVE FROM CANDIDATES AND STAFF, SUCH AS REFEREES, EMERGENCY CONTACTS AND DEPENDANTS
This section of the Privacy Policy applies to People Whose Data we receive from Candidates and Hays' Staff. These may include emergency contacts and referees. We will only contact them in appropriate circumstances.
What kind of personal information do we collect and how do we collect it?
All we need from referees is confirmation of what you already know about our Candidate or prospective member of Staff, so that they can secure that job they really want. Emergency contact details give us somebody to call on in an emergency. To ask for a reference, we'll obviously need the referee's contact details (such as name, email address and telephone number).

There are also certain categories of people that we share your personal data with if you are a Candidate, Temporary Worker, Person whose data we receive (e.g. a referee) or Staff Alumni.
Candidates:
If you are a Candidate, we may also share your personal data with the following categories of people:

third party partners, job boards, job platforms, job aggregators, software providers and cloud based databases where we consider this will improve the chances of finding you the right job or improving recruitment processes more generally;

in limited circumstances as appropriate, medical professionals such as your GP or an occupational health specialist;
the Client where you as a Temporary Worker are or will be working; and

If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorised access to your personal information please let us know immediately. Details of how to contact us can be found
here
.
How long do we keep your personal data for?
In determining the appropriate retention period for different types of personal data, we always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data in question, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of that personal data, the purposes for which we need to process it and whether we can achieve those purposes by other means (in addition of course to ensuring that we comply with our legal, regulatory and risk-management obligations).
We set out below the retention practices that we apply to certain categories of people.
Candidates:
If you are a Candidate, we will keep your personal data on our Systems for a period of up to two years from the point that we collect such personal data or subsequently have meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with).After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.  We may keep your personal data on our Systems for a longer period than this if we believe in good faith that we need to do so, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
We will consider there to be meaningful contact with you in this context if you, for example, submit a CV to us via our website, take part in any of our online training, communicate with us about potential roles (either by verbal or written communication) or click through from any of our marketing communications. Your receipt, opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us will not count as meaningful contact for these purposes, only where you click-through or reply directly – we will only deem that we have had meaningful contact with you if there is positive action on your part.
For those Candidates whose services are provided via a third party company or other entity, meaningful contact with you means meaningful contact with the company or entity which supplies your services. Where we are notified by such company or entity that it no longer has that relationship with you, we will retain your data for no longer than two years from that point or, if later, for the period of two years from the point we subsequently have meaningful contact directly with you.
If you have expressly indicated as a Candidate that you would rather we didn't retain your personal data, then we will Delete it from our Systems unless we believe in good faith that we need to preserve it, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
Temporary Workers:
If we employ or engage you as a Temporary Worker directly, we will ordinarily process your data throughout the course of your Temp Relationship and will then retain it for a period after we have parted ways. The precise length of time will depend on the type of data, our legitimate business needs and other legal or regulatory rules that may require us to retain it for certain minimum periods. For example, we may be required to retain certain data for the purposes of tax reporting or responding to tax queries. We may also retain it if it might be relevant to any potential litigation. In jurisdictions that allow it, we will generally retain personal data relating to you where necessary to enable us to provide you or a future employer with a reference.
If you are a Temporary Worker, we will also continue to process your personal data as a Candidate through the duration of your Temp Relationship and thereafter. The question of whether and the extent to which we will continue to process your personal data as Staff data through the duration of your Temp Relationship and thereafter depends on local law requirements.

Clients and Suppliers:
If you are a Client or a Supplier we will retain your personal data in order to provide you with services or to receive services from you, or to provide you with information about our services that we believe you may be interested in.
If you have expressly indicated that you're not interested in our services, then we will Delete your personal data from our Systems unless we believe in good faith that we need to preserve it, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
Website Users:
If you are a Website User we will retain your IP address and any other information that is required to operate the website or our mobile apps for 365 days.
Other Categories of people:
We will otherwise retain your data for as long as it is necessary to achieve the purpose it was collected or processed for. If this time has come or you have expressly indicated that you’re not interested in one of our website or mobile app services anymore, we will Delete it from our Systems unless we believe in good faith that we need to preserve it, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you HAVE given to us?
One of the GDPR's main objectives is to protect and clarify the rights of EU citizens and individuals in the EU with regards to data privacy. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below.
To get in touch about these rights, please
contact us
. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we will, where necessary, keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.
Right to object:
this right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following four reasons: (i) our legitimate interests; (ii) to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority; (iii) to send you direct marketing materials; and (iv) for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.
The “legitimate interests” and “direct marketing” categories above are the ones most likely to apply to our Website Users, Candidates, Temporary Workers, Clients and Suppliers. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless:
we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or
we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.
If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity.
Right to withdraw consent:
Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (for example, in order to use cookies or pixels in certain jurisdictions), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.
Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR):
You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or Delete such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is “manifestly unfounded or excessive”. If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.
Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject access requests and may refuse your request in accordance with such laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click
here
.
Right to erasure:
You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria:
the data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed them;
where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing;
the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in a manner which does not comply with the GDPR);
it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller; or
if we process the data because we believe it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests, you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.
Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject right to erasure and may refuse your request in accordance with local laws.
For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click
here
.
We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:
to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;
for public health reasons in the public interest;
for archival, research or statistical purposes; or
to exercise or defend a legal claim.
When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will Delete the relevant data.
Right to restrict processing:
You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either: (i) one of the circumstances listed below is resolved; (ii) you consent; or (iii) further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important EU or Member State public interest.
The circumstances in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are:
where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you. In this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified;
where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. Here, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data;
where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it; and
where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.
Right to rectification:
You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.
Right of data portability:
If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your Hays account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we will directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies to: (i) personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention); (ii) personal data provided by you; and (iii) personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to fulfil a contract.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Details of how to contact them can be found
here
.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your personal data), details of how to contact us can be found
here
. Please note that we will, where necessary, keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.
You may ask to unsubscribe from job alerts and other marketing communications from us at any time. Details of how to do so can be found
here
.
It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the period for which we hold your data.

How do we store and transfer data internationally?
So you want to know more about how we store and transfer your data internationally? In order to provide you with the best service and to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, your data will be transferred:
between and within Hays entities;
to third parties (such as advisers or other Suppliers to the Hays business);
to overseas Clients where applicable;
to Clients within your country, where applicable, who may, in turn, transfer your data internationally;
to a cloud-based storage provider; and
to other third parties as set out in the section entitled “Who do we share your personal data with” above.
We want to make sure that your data are stored and transferred in a way which is secure. We will therefore only transfer data outside of the European Economic Area or EEA (i.e. the Member States of the European Union, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data, for example:
by way of data transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data by data controllers in the EEA to data controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws; or
transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the European Commission in respect of that country's levels of data protection via its legislation; or
by way of scheme approved by the European Commission (whether as a successor to the Privacy Shield or otherwise) which regulates exchanges of person data between jurisdictions; or
where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract (for example, if we need to transfer data outside the EEA in order to meet our obligations under that contract if you are a Client of ours); or
where you have consented to the data transfer.
To ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate procedures with the third parties we share your personal data with to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the law on data protection.
Cookies Policy
What's a cookie?
A “cookie“ (or similar technology such as a tracking pixel) (“Cookie”) is a very small text file or graphic that is placed on your device when you visit a webpage or open an email and which records your behaviour (such as navigation of a website). Cookies are used to enhance your use of the various Hays digital channels, for example by enabling us to present tailored content and options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes.
Cookies are used by nearly all digital channels and do not harm your system. We use them irrespective of whether you interact with Hays via our website, an app or other digital channel, and regardless of whether you are a Candidate, Temporary Worker, Client, Supplier, Website User or someone else.
If you want to check or change what types of Cookies you accept, this can usually be altered using the privacy settings within your browser, or you can do so very easily using the “Cookie Preferences” link at either the top or bottom of the website. Please note that if you access Hays' services across multiple devices, you may need to adjust your settings via the Cookie Preferences link on each of your devices.
How do we use Cookies?
We use Cookies to do the following:
to personalise your experience of our digital channels and to enhance their functionality, for example:
to keep you signed in to your account throughout your visit;
to tailor and increase the relevance of the content that you see (which may vary depending on whether you are a Candidate, Temporary Worker, Client, Supplier, Website User or someone else, and also according to your preferences) which we hope will in turn increase engagement with and improve the experience of using our services (and encourage you to return);
if you are a Candidate, to personalise marketing content that we make available to you via our digital channels (where you have consented to that marketing) which we hope will increase application numbers, conversion rates and application usefulness;
to understand how you engage with our website and other digital channels, for example by tracking the pages you have visited, the interactions you have made, the links you have followed, and the number of job ads and articles read. This enables us to understand how you use our digital channels, tailor what we show and send to you, and track any patterns that emerge individually or from larger groups. This helps us to develop and improve our digital channels and services in response to what our visitors want and need (and we understand that those wants and needs vary depending on whether you are a Candidate, Temporary Worker, Client, Supplier, Website User or someone else) which in turn helps us increase engagement with and improve the experience of using our services by increasing the relevance of the content that we serve. Also, as described above in the sections on “Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making”, the process of analysing web-based behaviours enables us to award Candidates a weighted “approachability score” with a view to providing insights into Candidates' needs and allow Hays to follow up where needed, and Consultants use these scores as part of shortlisting and ranking Candidates and as a factor in determining whether to approach/show roles to a Candidate, which will serve to supplement other data that Hays holds about the Candidate; and
if you are a Candidate:
to help us advertise jobs to you that we think you'll be interested in, by personalising the roles that are brought to your attention;
to personalise our recommendations for editorial content (such as reports about developments in your industry) that we think may be of interest;
to enrich Candidate data and existing profiles about Candidates that we already hold on our Systems;
analysing data obtained by tracking and monitoring Candidates’ experience and account activity in order to profile Candidates and allocate them to “talent pools” based on their attributes and behaviours (e.g. previous roles, skills, industry experience, location, or when a Candidate is willing to work) – as described above in the sections on “Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making”, the assignment of Candidates to talent pools is a fully automated process and can involve the use of bots.
Hopefully this means less time for you trawling through endless pages and will get you into the employment you want more quickly.
Cookies are either:
Session cookies: these are only stored on your device during your browser session and automatically expire when you close your browser – they allow the website to recognise and link your actions during a browsing session and usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page, but they do not collect any information from your device; or
Persistent cookies: a persistent cookie is stored on your device in between browsing sessions and so it remains there when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again. We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics and for personalisation (see above for more information about what personalisation may involve and also the sections above on “Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making”).
Cookies can also be categorised as follows:
Strictly required cookies:
These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when applying for a job, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on our website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.
Functionality cookies:
These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our website. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular. Furthermore these cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.
Advertisement cookies:
These cookies help us to advertise details of potential job opportunities that we think may be of interest. These cookies are persistent (for as long as you are registered with us) and mean that when you log in or return to the website, you may see advertising for jobs that are similar to jobs that you have previously browsed.
The Cookie Preferences link on our website provides a list of the Cookies we use in your jurisdiction, why we use them and what types of Cookies they are.
How to manage or reject Cookies
When you first visit our website(s) you will be asked to choose what kind of Cookies you want to receive. We ask for your prior consent for some Cookies via the Cookie Preferences link, while we may set strictly necessary Cookies without your consent. You may also use the privacy settings within your browser to do this. Please be aware that rejecting all Cookies through your browser’s privacy settings will mean that you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website's features. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your Cookie preferences.
You can update your given consent at any time via the Cookie Preferences link. You may also choose to opt-out of Cookies which are not strictly necessary to perform basic features of our website by changing your browser settings. If you use the Cookie Preferences link to update your choice of Cookies, please note that this does not result in deletion of already placed Cookies on your device. If you want to delete these Cookies you should do so using your browser’s privacy settings.
If you choose to delete all Cookies through your browser’s privacy settings, this will also delete any record of having opted-out that may be stored by a Cookie on your device (so that the opt-out can continue to be actioned) and you may need to actively opt-out again.
third party services
In the course of using our services, Candidates, Temporary Workers and Staff Alumni may wish to access independent websites and third party services (e.g. job platforms) which are not operated by us. Such independent sites and third parties are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement about whether to use any such independent sites, including whether to use any services offered by the third party.
Occasionally, third party service providers that we have engaged will process personal data that we given to them as a data controller in their own right, for example, for the purposes of: (i) conducting their own internal reporting, (ii) preventing or responding to threats to the security or integrity of their systems; (iii) establishing, exercising or defending their own legal claims; (iv) complying with legal obligations that apply to them; and (v) using personal data in anonymised or aggregated form to improve their own products and services. They will usually have their own privacy policies which set out more detail in relation to these processing activities.

Annex 3
Country-Specific Variations to our Privacy Policy
PRIVACY POLICY TOPIC
JURISDICTION
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC LEGAL REQUIREMENT
HAYS' PROCESSING OF YOUR SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA
UK
Where your personal data are processed in accordance with the fair processing condition relating to our rights and obligations under employment and social security law, this relates to our processing of your personal data which is necessary for compliance with legal obligations (such as ensuring that we pay you statutory sick pay, comply with the statutory employment protections that you enjoy, comply with health and safety laws, and ensure that appropriate National Insurance contributions are made).
HAYS' PROCESSING OF VIDEO RECORDINGS
UK
We may from time to time record question and answer sessions and/or video interviews of Candidates to support our recruitment services for you and our work in finding opportunities for Clients. The video recordings shall be shared with Clients and viewed via a secure third party platform. We may also, at the request of Clients, record presentations by Clients to share with Candidates using the same secure platform. Video recordings will be removed from the third party platform once they are no longer needed or if a Candidate or Client requests deletion. Video recordings will be retained by Hays in line with normal Hays’ retention policy.
HAYS' PROCESSING AND SHARING OF REFERENCES
UK
We adopt a policy of openness, where possible, in relation to references that referees provide about Candidates.
This means that if a Candidate wishes to see a reference that a referee has provided about them, we will endeavour to comply with the Candidate's request unless the referee objects to us doing so (and we will give the referee the opportunity to object).
As well as sharing references provided by a referee with the Candidate, we will also share references with third parties, such as Clients (e.g. those seeking to employ the Candidate) and MSP providers (e.g. if they request references while conducting an audit of the participants in an MSP programme) unless the referee objects to us doing so (and we will give the referee the opportunity to object).
Glossary
Candidates
- include individuals with whom Hays has not had prior contact, but whom Hays reasonably considers would be interested in, or might benefit from, Hays’ services and being considered for any roles advertised or promoted by Hays including permanent, part-time and temporary positions and freelance roles with Hays' Clients (including those individuals who want to become Temporary Workers). Candidates also include applicants for such roles, as well as people who have supplied a speculative CV to Hays not in relation to a specific job, and/or who have engaged with Hays about Hays’ services and/or any roles advertised or promoted by Hays. Individual contractors, freelance workers and employees of suppliers or other third parties put forward for roles with Hays' Clients as part of an MSP offering or otherwise will be treated as Candidates for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Clients
- while it speaks for itself, this category covers our customers, clients, and others to whom Hays provides services in the course of its business or whom Hays reasonably considers would be interested in our services. In certain circumstances, Hays provides services to individual employees who work for Client organisations, such as training courses to teaching staff who work for Clients in the education sector. Please note that in this context, Hays requires Clients to communicate the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy (namely the sections directed at Clients) to their employees.
Delete
– In this day and age it is virtually impossible to guarantee the permanent and irretrievable deletion of electronic data. In addition, as we have explained to you in this Privacy Policy, sometimes we will be obliged by law or regulation, or need for risk-management reasons, to retain the ability to access certain elements of personal data.  However, our commitment to you is that once your personal data reaches the end of its nominal retention period, or where we receive a valid request from you to erase it, we will put in place specific operational and Systems measures to ensure that your data is “put beyond use”. By this we mean that while the data will still technically exist on an archive system, we will ensure that it cannot be readily accessed by any of our operational Systems, processes or Staff. Only a very (and we mean exceptionally) small number of senior Staff, in very (and, again, we mean exceptionally) limited and carefully prescribed situations, will be able to restore your personal data so that it can be viewed for those legitimate purposes. Once we are clear that all relevant legally mandated retention periods have expired (which, for present purposes, we expect to be the period of ten years), we will go the additional final step of undertaking a “hard delete”, whereby not even that very limited number of senior Staff would be able to restore your personal data.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
– a European Union statutory instrument which aims to harmonise European data protection laws. It has an effective date of 25 May 2018, and any references to it should be construed accordingly to include any related national data protection legislation.
Managed Service Provider (MSP) programmes
– Clients' outsourcing of the management of external staff (including freelance workers, independent contractors and temporary employees) to an external recruitment provider.
Other people whom Hays may contact
– these may include Candidates' and Hays' Staff emergency contacts and referees. We will only contact them in appropriate circumstances.
Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) services
– full or partial outsourcing of the recruitment process for permanent employees to a recruitment provider.
Staff
– includes current and former employees and interns engaged directly in the business of Hays (or who have accepted an offer to be engaged) as well as certain other workers who are or were engaged in the business of providing services to Hays (even though they are not classed as employees). For these purposes we also include employees of Hays who are engaged to work on Clients' premises under the terms of RPO or MSP agreements. To be clear, 'Staff' does not include individuals hired by Hays for the purpose of being placed with Clients outside of an RPO/MSP arrangement. These individuals are treated in the same way as Hays' Candidates and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Likewise, independent contractors and consultants performing services for Hays fall within the definition of a 'Supplier' for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Suppliers
– refers to partnerships and companies (including sole traders), and atypical workers such as independent contractors and freelance workers, who provide services to Hays. In certain circumstances Hays will sub-contract the services it provides to Clients to third party suppliers who perform services on Hays' behalf. In this context, suppliers that are individual contractors, freelance workers, or employees of suppliers will be treated as Candidates for data protection purposes. Please note that in this context, Hays requires Suppliers to communicate the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy (namely the sections directed at Candidates) to their employees.
Staff Alumni
– refers to former members of Staff who have expressed their wish to remain part of Hays' alumni network and to use Hays' alumni portal.
Systems
– telephone, computer, internet and Wi-Fi systems, software and portals, accounts and/or networks belonging, controlled or used by Hays that are used to transmit, undertake and/or receive communications or are otherwise used in the course of Hays' business, including candidate portal software and CRM systems.
Temp Relationship
– means our contractual relationship with Temporary Workers while they are employed or engaged directly by us.
Temporary Workers
– includes someone who becomes employed or engaged by Hays for the purposes of undertaking temporary work for a Client or other Hays group company. If you are a Temporary Worker, we will also continue to process your personal data as a Candidate throughout the duration of your temporary work assignment and thereafter, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. The question of whether and the extent to which the Recruits Privacy Policy and the Staff Privacy Policy apply to you as a Temporary Worker depends on local law requirements. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click
here
.
UK GDPR
– the GDPR as it forms part of the Laws of the UK by virtue of Section 3 of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
Visitors
– means individuals who visit Hays premises but who are not members of Hays' Staff.
Website Users
– any individual who accesses any of the Hays websites or any of the Hays mobile applications (apps).

1. About NextRoll's Services
Back to top
NextRoll is a marketing technology company that helps big and small companies deliver products ambitious marketers use and rely on to grow their businesses. Powered by machine learning and integrated data platforms, NextRoll’s intelligent, data-driven marketing and advertising services and solutions go beyond serving digital ads by providing companies better visibility into which audiences are most interested in certain products and services. By using NextRoll’s proprietary data and machine learning offerings (“
NextRoll Technology
”), companies can better understand their current customers, find new loyal customers and build lasting customer relationships through intelligence-driven direct marketing activities.
NextRoll has two different business divisions:
AdRoll
is an e-commerce marketing platform for companies that sell their products and services directly to consumers (called “
Direct to Consumer
” or “
D2C
” companies). The AdRoll platform makes it easy and affordable for D2C companies to deliver the cross-channel experiences consumers expect – enabling
them to sell more to their existing consumers and identify new consumers to introduce to their products and services. AdRoll does this by creating connected, personalized customer journeys that enable brands to reach new and existing customers through digital advertising, email marketing and onsite experiences. AdRoll also helps companies understand the impact of their marketing efforts with advanced measurement and attribution;
RollWorks
offers an account-based platform for businesses who want to sell their products and services to other businesses (called “
Business to Business”
or “
B2B
” companies). Our RollWorks Services help B2B companies identify their target accounts and key buyers, reach those accounts across multiple channels and measure program effectiveness in their system-of-record.
Interest-Based Advertising
NextRoll’s Technology helps our D2C and B2B Customers provide ads and send emails to people that are most likely to find them interesting by showing them ads that are relevant to their specific interests. This is called “interest-based advertising”. We show many of these interest-based ads on websites and mobile apps which rely on advertising revenue to support the content they provide - and what we all consume - for free each day.

”) operated by one of our Customers, open an email from a Customer, or get served an ad by us on behalf of our Customer on a third party site, we may collect certain data from your device as described in this Service Privacy Notice. Our platform then uses that data, as well as other data described in
What Data We Collect
, to help our Customers provide ads and send emails to you that aim to be more relevant to you. To see an example of how this works in practice, see
Example of Interest-Based Advertising.
Interest-based advertising enables publishers of Digital Properties to more accurately determine which ads to serve to specific users based on near real-time data. In turn, this allows our Customers to provide more effective advertising that reaches a more precise pool of prospective buyers.
All in all, interest-based advertising promotes better competition in the marketplace (for example, small and medium sized companies have a better opportunity to reach as many prospective buyers as large, well-funded, competitors), and allows our Customers to provide free or low-cost content to their customers due to the resources generated by effective advertising.
Example of Interest-Based Advertising
You’re working from home for the foreseeable future and want to invest in more comfortable work-from-home clothing. You can’t go to the store right now so you decide to peruse some e-commerce sites instead. You go to Google and type in “loungewear” and a list of websites pop up, including one for ABC Sweatshirts. You’re still in the research phase so you browse their site but don’t purchase. Luckily, ABC Sweatshirts is a
customer
of NextRoll and uses the AdRoll technology for its e-commerce platform. Our technology notes that your device visited ABC Loungwear’s website and was looking at sweatshirts.
Later, as you browse the Internet, we show you ads online from ABC Sweatshirts to encourage you to come back and purchase the sweatshirt, perhaps even with a discount offer or notice of an upcoming sale. We may also show you ads from other companies that sell similar products or services you may be interested in to complete your loungewear outfit, such as sweatpants or home slippers. In addition, if you gave ABC Sweatshirts your email address for marketing purposes, we may also send you emails on behalf of the brand that tell you about its new exclusive line of sweatshirts, special promotions, and more. Alternatively, we may use your email to serve you interest-based ads on social media (for example, your social media provider may match a pseudonymized form of your email address that we provide them with the email address details you have registered with your social media account, enabling us to show you interest-based ads in your social media newsfeed)
.
Measurement and Attribution
In addition to interest-based advertising, we also provide various analytics to help our Customers measure the success of their advertising campaigns and identify prospective buyers who may be the most interested in their products or services.
For instance, by collecting a unique identifier (such as a cookie ID) from the devices of users who see our Customers’ ads or visit their Digital Properties, we can measure whether those unique identifiers subsequently took a particular action, such as buying a Customer’s product or visiting their Digital Property (sometimes called a “conversion”). In some cases, we may use our cross device data asset to match unique identifiers (which includes browsing activity) to email addresses. Customers are only notified of a match if the email already exists in the Customer ‘s CRM records. AdRoll’s D2C Services can collect, measure and analyze different types of data in conjunction with these unique identifiers and provide useful information to our AdRoll Customers such as what IP address ranges visitors to their Digital Properties are from (indicating the geographic locations of a visitor, which may help indicate what locations to run a particular ad campaign), what products or services located on their Digital Property are attracting more attention (or less), and what ad campaigns ultimately led a cookie ID back to a Digital Property to view more products or make a purchase.
RollWorks’ B2B Services provide similar types of analytics derived from the same sort of data as AdRoll’s D2C Services described above, but with a focus on firmographic information to provide insights on the type of B2B customers that appear to be interested in specific products or offerings on that Customer’s Digital Property. For example, determining which IP address ranges are associated with a unique identifier (such as a cookie ID) so we can identify companies who may be interested in our Customer’s product or service, or, if a unique identifier is linked to an email address that has already been provided to the B2B customer, RollWorks may alert the Customer of increased browsing activity that indicates interest from a particular known account.
Overall, we use the information learned from unique identifier behavior across the Internet to provide reporting to both our D2C and B2B Customers. A more detailed list of all the data we collect is described in
What Data We Collect.
2. What Data we Collect
Back to top
We collect the following categories of data in the provision of our Services for the purposes explained below.
Data You or Our Customers Provide To Us
Email and CRM data from our Customers
:
Some Customers provide their customer relationship data to us (e.g. name, email address, company address, mobile number) or instruct us to collect clear email addresses on their behalf using NextRoll Technology (“
Customer CRM Data
”) for processing as part of our Services. By doing so, we help our Customers identify who is showing interest on their Digital Properties as well as serve, measure and analyze interest-based ads to their current or potential customers (we may also trigger these ads by licensing
RollWorks B2B Contact Data
to a Customer). For example, if you are browsing a software company’s website and submitted your email to download a white paper, the software company may use our Services to contact you and provide you with more information about the software company’s products that appear to be of most interest to you (subject to the marketing preferences you indicate to the software company). We use our Customer’s CRM Data only as a processor for the purpose of assisting that particular Customer with their own advertising efforts and reporting performance back to the Customer's CRM system. We do not share clear email addresses belonging to one Customer with another Customer.
Shopping Data
:
Some Customers provide us with data about their buyers’ shopping habits, including non-financial transactional data, product codes and check-out activity in addition to the browsing data that we collect. This data may come from their Digital Properties or other non-financial transactional data they maintain. We use this data to help us better target, personalize and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. This data is also Customer CRM Data and belongs to our Customers and is handled by NextRoll as a processor.
Hashed email addresses
:
When a Customer permits us, we collect hashed versions of the email addresses that you have entered on that Customer’s Digital Property. Hashing is a technology process that pseudonymizes email addresses. For instance, when joe
the
cat@nextroll.com is run through a typical hashing function, it becomes a string of digits, such as: 0F0B7B1A1A7E8BDBBC6AA545F8CCD6F83671B32479271BFCB6CC8498912058D5. We take this step to protect email addresses, while being able to use the unique identifier created for the purpose of recognizing you online across Digital Properties and sending you interest-based ads across different devices (computers, tablets and mobile devices) and browsers (also called “cross-device matching”). We describe cross-device matching in further detail in
How We Use the Data We Collect.
Data We Receive in Our Corporate Capacity
:
We also collect data from our own Customers and visitors to our website(s). To learn more about how we collect and use that data, please see our
Website Privacy Notice.
Data We Automatically Collect From Your Device
Unless you have opted-out or have otherwise refused to provide consent, the following is data that we collect from your device automatically:
Cookies:
A unique identifier that NextRoll assigns to you when visiting a Customer’s Digital Property so NextRoll can understand your online journey and have the opportunity to serve ads to you when you visit Publisher’s Digital Properties.
Device Information:
This is technical information about the device you use to access our Customers’ Digital Property, such as your operating system. Additionally, in the case of mobile devices, your device type, and mobile device's unique advertising identifier (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID), and any other unique identifier that may be assigned to the mobile device, such as an Android ID or UDID in older Apple phone models, or a non-cookie unique identifier used by
Non-Cookie Technologies
.
IP Address:
The IP address associated with the device you are using when accessing a Customer’s Digital Property.
Location Data:
This is non-precise information related to your geography derived from your device’s IP address. This does not reveal your precise geographic coordinates (i.e. GPS latitude and longitude) - only country, state, city and zip/postal code, and helps us to display ads that are relevant to your general location (for example, showing ads in French if you are located in France).
Browser Data:
This is technical information about the browser you are using that is captured in order to serve you an ad that can be rendered on your device (for example, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).
Activity on Customers’ Digital Properties:
This is data about your browsing activity on a Customer’s website or application. This includes, for example, which pages you visited and when, what items were clicked on a page, how much time was spent on a page, whether you downloaded a white paper on a B2B website, what site or ad brought you to the Customer’s website, what items you placed into your online shopping cart and what products were purchased and the price of the products purchased.
Ad Data:
This is data about the online ads we have served (or attempted to serve) to you. This includes , for example, how many times an ad has been served to you, what page the ad appeared on and whether you clicked on or otherwise interacted with the ad.
All of this data is collected to help make sure you get the best and most relevant experience when engaging with our Customers.
Data We Collect From Third Party Sources
Campaign Performance Data:
This data includes information about how well our Customers’ ads and campaigns have performed, whether on our platform or on other advertising platforms.
Data from Audience Partners:
We may collect additional information about you from our audience partners who create and provide us with segments which we use for our Customers (“
Audience Partner
”). A segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g. demographic or firmographic attributes). We use this data to better understand the Customers’ target audience and to better market the Customers’ products and services to you. We may also work with our Customers and Audience Partners to synchronize their unique, pseudonymous identifiers to our own to enable us to more accurately recognize a particular unique browser or device and the advertising interests associated with it (commonly known as “ID or User Syncing”).
Data from Advertising Partners:
This is data that allows us to match the NextRoll cookie identifier with identifiers that may already be used by other companies in the digital advertising ecosystem that we work with (“
Advertising Partners
”). For example, we work with ad exchanges, publishers and supply side platforms (i.e. companies that sell advertising space on publishers’ websites) in order to serve our ads. Matching cookie identifiers helps us deliver ads to you and recognize you across browsers and devices and may include pseudonymous advertising identifiers (meaning identifiers that help identify your browser or device, but not you directly) which some Advertising Partners choose to share with us.
Data collected pursuant to RollWorks Business only:
Email Communications:
Customers may provide us with access to their email communications from their prospects when they have engaged us to provide email marketing services. NextRoll acts as a processor of this CRM Data. . When access to this data involves access to Gmail Data, it will be subject to these additional restrictions:
We will only use access to read, write, modify or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email that allows users to compose, send, read and process emails and will not transfer this Gmail Data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law or as part of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets;
We will not use this Gmail Data for serving advertisements; and
We will not allow humans to read this data unless agreed to by the Customer, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for the provision of NextRoll’s Services.
Contact data from third parties
:
We obtain and collect contact data from various third-party sources, including from public sources and through licenses with data providers. We may also infer contact data based on email addresses and email naming conventions. This contact data is B2B information – in other words, it is typically a business email address, business street address and a business telephone number. Please note that as part of our RollWorks Services, we do not collect business email addresses from third parties for any individuals who are residing in any European Territories (as defined in
International Transfers
).
3. How We Use the Data We Collect
Back to top
Our goal is to leverage this data to help Customers better identify and engage with you and, in turn, provide you with an ideal online experience whereby ad-sponsored content is available for free and the ads served to you are for products and services that aim to be relevant and interesting to you. The data we collect also helps Customers analyze traffic on their Digital Properties, measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns and gauge the interest of prospective buyers.  Additionally, we use this data to operate, improve and enhance our Services.
Specifically, we use this data for the following purposes:
Interest-Based Advertising:
To select ads that are more likely to be relevant to you based on data such as your browsing activity, the time of day and time spent visiting specific Digital Properties, and non-precise geographic data inferred about your device(s). For example, we may show you ads for your favorite shopping site (or similar sites we think you may like) for goods or services only available in your city, region or country during your lunch or commute hours.
Segmenting Audiences:
To segment you into groups (like bargain hunters, high intent visitors, low intent visitors) for certain purposes such as reporting and analytics as well as determining what ads and email content would best peak your interest.  To do so, we use data from Customer Digital Properties you visit in addition to data provided by the Customer and Audience Partners (i.e. demographic and firmographic information about your unique identifier).
Ad Delivery:
We use data about your browser or other technical information about your device in order to technically deliver advertising and confirm successful delivery of the ad.
Frequency Capping:
We use data about the ads that have been served to you to make sure you will not see the same ad too many times. If we know you’ve already seen one of our Customer’s ads several times, we’ll try to show you a different ad next time.
Sequencing:
If you are being served a sequence of ads, to make sure we show you the right ad next in the sequence.
Mapping data to Our Cross-Device Asset:
NextRoll’s cross-device asset is used to connect multiple devices to one person, household, and/or online identifiers such as an email address (hashed for security) that a Customer may have collected directly from its customers. The cross-device asset allows companies to better understand their known-customer activity, as well as improves the ability to target and measure ad campaigns (including limiting the number of times the same person or household sees an ad).
Cross-device matching
:
Identifying different devices and browsers that are likely to be associated with you so that ads can be targeted, capped and sequenced across those devices, and so that campaign effectiveness can be measured and analyzed. For example, cross-device matching helps us not show you ads for the shoes you were looking at on your phone but already purchased on your tablet. Instead we’ll try to show you ads for an upcoming triathlon where you can put those shoes to work. It also helps us match devices so we can honor your opt-out choices across all devices we know are connected to the opted-out cookie. You may opt-out of cross-device interest-based targeting by employing the respective opt-out techniques we describe in
Your Choices and Opting-Out of Targeted Ads
. To learn more about how we use cross-device matching,
visit our blog
.
Syncing Online Identifiers with Customer CRM Data
:
Customers may use NextRoll Services to match online browsing activity indicated by online identifiers with existing email addresses the Customer has already obtained ( i.e. Customer CRM Data).  Customers may also use this information to understand which consumers or business accounts are showing increased interest to better understand their website audience and respond with appropriate marketing activity.
Identifying Companies Associated with an IP Range for B2B marketing
:
We match IP address ranges to companies who disclose their IP address ranges in order to provide aggregated reports to companies regarding their website traffic.
Reporting and Attribution:
By analyzing activity on our Customers’ Digital Properties, we provide our Customers insights into how their ad campaigns are performing and surface insights about their site visitors. Reporting may include ad metrics, such as traffic on certain Digital Properties, measuring impact of campaigns, impressions (ads served), clicks (ads you clicked on) and conversions. What qualifies as a “conversion” is defined by the Customer—it might include, for example, a sale or a white paper download or a correlation to an actual or inferred sale, site visit or store visit. This data allows a Customer to determine if an ad is not performing well (few attributed conversions), so that the Customer can update the ad (perhaps with a better deal!).
Licensing Data:
When we receive an email address for a U.S. resident or obtain attribute data from third party data providers or derive an email address we may license that data to our Customers. For example, our
RollWorks Contact Data Product
provides our Customers with business email addresses.
Conducting Our Corporate Operations:
Data we collect in our corporate capacity (i.e. our own B2B lists of Customers) is used to conduct our business operations and communications. Please see our
Website Privacy Notice
to learn more about how we use that data.
Complying with Legal Process:
To satisfy in good faith any applicable law, legal process or proper governmental request, such as to respond to a subpoena (whether civil or criminal) or similar process.
Investigating Wrongdoing and Protecting Ourselves or Third Parties:
To enforce or investigate any potential violation of our
Terms of Service
, policies or the law, and to protect ourselves, our Customers or any third party from any potential harm (whether tangible or intangible).
4. Data Sharing
Back to top
We may disclose data about you with the following third parties:
With a Customer:
We may share data about how you have interacted with a Customer’s Digital Properties, email campaigns or ads.  We may share
business contact data
collected from third party sources or inferred (for example, based on email naming conventions) with a RollWorks B2B Customer if we think that your business or employer would be interested in that Customer’s products. In regards to RollWorks’ Services, we do not collect contact data about residents of European Territories from third parties.
With Our Audience Partners:
We share hashed email addresses or other pseudonymous online identifiers with our Audience Partners in connection with audience creation and modeling and creating segments for the Customer based on the Customer’s CRM Data.

7. Non-Cookie Technology for Tracking Outside European Territories
Back to top
In respect of website visitors with IP addresses
not from a European Territory
, NextRoll and some of its Advertising Partners may use technologies other than cookie technology to recognize your computer, device or browser for the purposes of interest-based advertising, analyzing engagement with ads or content, measuring the effectiveness of a particular ad campaign or marketing effort, to monitor against fraud or misuse of our Services, or in other ways described in this Service Privacy Notice in
How We Use the Data We Collect
. This use of non-cookie technology may be used in addition to cookies, or separately, to collect and record data about your web browsing activities on browsers, search engines or other platforms that may not utilize NextRoll Technology.
You may opt-out of tracking via non-cookie technologies by employing the respective opt-out techniques described in
Your Choices and Opting-Out of Interest-Based Advertising and Analytics Ads
.
8. Your Choices and Opting-Out of Interest-Based Advertising and Analytics
Back to top
You can control how you share your data with NextRoll, including electing to opt-out of interest-based advertising altogether. Please visit our
opt-out webpage
to opt-out.
Generally speaking, an opt-out allows you to direct NextRoll not to engage in a particular type of data collection. There are many different ways that NextRoll collects data, different purposes for that data collection, and different industry-specific and NextRoll-specific tools for opting-out. We describe below the different options for controlling how NextRoll uses your data:
Web browser:
You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads served by us or on our behalf by clicking on the blue icon
that typically appears in the corner of the ads we serve and following the instructions provided or by clicking on our
opt-out page
. Please note that this opt-out function is browser-specific and relies on an opt-out cookie. This means if you delete your cookies or upgrade your browser after having opted out, you will need to opt-out again.
Cross Device Opt-Out:
As described above in
How We Use the Data We Collect
, we may link multiple browsers or devices to the cookie ID, hashed email address or other unique identifiers associated with you. If you opt-out on a browser or device and we have additional devices or browsers linked to you, we will extend your opt-out decision to any other linked browsers and devices. Since we only link users across browsers and devices in certain conditions, there may be cases where you are still being tracked in a different browser or device we have not linked, and where we are treating you as a different user.
Mobile Device Opt-Out:
To opt-out of receiving interest-based ads that are based on your behavior across different mobile applications, see instructions for iOS and Android devices:
iOS 7 or Higher:
Go to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting; and
For Android devices with OS 2.2 or higher and Google Play Services version 4.0 or higher:
Open your Google Settings app > Select Ads > Enable “Opt-out of interest-based advertising.”
Industry Opt-Out Tools and Self-Regulation:
NextRoll is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (
NAI
) and adheres to the framework principles. You may use the
NAI opt-out tool
which will allow you to opt-out of seeing interest-based ads from us and from other NAI approved member companies. In addition, the NAI opt-out tool allows you to separately opt-out of “audience matched” advertising through the NAI’s “
Audience Matched Advertising Opt-Out
.” You can also use the
email opt-out tool
provided by our Advertising Partner, LiveRamp, to opt-out your email address from their database. Audience matching is a particular type of interest-based advertising where de-identified data (e.g. hashed emails) is tied to “offline” activity or information (this information generally is or can be associated with a consumer’s email address - whether that information is part of our Customer’s own customer lists or in lists we license to the Customer). To do “audience matching,” we or another platform then “match” that information (in de-identified form) to cookie IDs, mobile ad IDs, or other online identifiers. We describe this hashing activity in additional detail in
What Data We Collect
. Because this “audience matched” information is derived from an email address or information that can be tied to an email address, it is possible to opt-out with an email address. However, when you opt-out this way, you will need to submit all of the email addresses that you use for the opt-out to work.
We also comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (
DAA
). You may opt-out of receiving personalized ads from other companies that perform ad targeting services, including some that we may work with as Advertising Partners, via the
DAA website
.
We also comply with the Canadian Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (
DAAC
). You may opt-out of receiving personalized ads from other companies that perform ad targeting services, including some that we may work with as Advertising Partners, via the
DAAC website
.
Finally, we also adhere to the European Interactive Advertising Digital Alliance (EDAA) guidelines for online advertising. You may opt-out via the
EDAA website
.
9. Data Retention
Back to top
Customer CRM Data:
The data retention period for Customer CRM Data is as follows:
If either Customer or NextRoll explicitly terminates the NextRoll Services in accordance with our Terms of Service, NextRoll will delete Customer CRM Data within 90 days from the termination date.
If a Customer’s account has been suspended for 90 days or more, the Customer CRM Data will be deleted.
When a Customer has not logged in to their NextRoll account in the past 365 days
and
there has been no product usage in the past 30 days
and
no media spend has occurred in the past 30 days, the Customer CRM Data will be deleted when the 366th day of no login activity occurs for the account.
Customers may request deletion of Customer CRM Data by visiting the privacy requests
webpage
.
Mobile Identifiers and Cookie Identifiers:
Cookies we set expire (and are then deleted) 13 months from the last time your device accessed a Digital Property using NextRoll Technology. If you visit another Digital Property that uses our technology inside that 13-month expiry period, then the expiry period will be reset and measured from that date instead. The expiration period for mobile identifiers is controlled by you on your device.
Personal Data Associated with Mobile and Cookie Identifiers Related to Browsing History:
We delete personal data associated with mobile and cookie identifiers after 12 months (for example, data such as a Customer’s website you visited or ads that you may have clicked).
Personal Data Associated with Advertising Bidding Requests:
Data logged in order to process an advertising bid request we have received from an Advertising Partner (such as a cookie identifier, IP address, the domain url requesting to display the ad, and browser information) are deleted after 7 days. Data we have logged regarding bids we have placed to display an advertisement (including cookie identifiers, mobile identifiers, the advertisement bid on and the advertisement won or displayed to the visitor) are deleted after 15 days.
Personal Data Associated with the Display of an Advertisement:
Data logged for the display of an advertisement (including cookie identifiers, the advertisement won or displayed to you and data indicating whether you clicked on the particular advertisement displayed) are deleted after 12 months.
Hashed Email Addresses:
Hashed email addresses collected from Customer site visitors are deleted 12 months from the last date the hashed email was collected.
10. Security
Back to top
We apply technical, administrative and organizational security measures to protect the data we collect against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against other unlawful forms of processing. NextRoll has also completed the SOC2 Type 2 Audit (Security and Privacy) with no exceptions. This report is only available to Customers by a request to

11. International Transfers
Back to top
We may transfer the data we collect about you to countries (including the United States of America) other than the country where we originally collected it for the purposes of performing our Services. In general, the transferring countries will be the countries in which we, our Customers, our Advertising Partners, or their service providers operate.
Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as your country. However, when we transfer your data to other countries, we will protect that data as described in this Service Privacy Notice and take steps, where necessary, to ensure that international transfers comply with applicable laws.
For example, when we transfer your data from a European Territory (as defined below) to our parent company in the United States, we do so under the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses. These Standard Contractual Clauses are incorporated in the
NextRoll Data Protection Addendum
between NextRoll and each of our Customers where applicable. When we transfer your data outside of a European Territory to Advertising Partners (or vice versa), we do so under lawful data export mechanisms which may include Standard Contractual Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules.

1. About NextRoll's Services
Back to top
NextRoll is a marketing technology company that helps big and small companies deliver products ambitious marketers use and rely on to grow their businesses. Powered by machine learning and integrated data platforms, NextRoll’s intelligent, data-driven marketing and advertising services and solutions go beyond serving digital ads by providing companies better visibility into which audiences are most interested in certain products and services.  By using NextRoll’s proprietary data and machine learning offerings (“NextRoll Technology,”), companies can better understand their customers, find new loyal customers and build lasting customer relationships through intelligence-driven marketing activities.
NextRoll has two different business divisions:
AdRoll
is an e-commerce marketing platform for companies that sell their products and services directly to consumers (called “Direct to Consumer” or “D2C” companies). The AdRoll platform makes it easy and affordable for D2C companies to deliver the cross-channel experiences consumers expect – enabling them to sell more to their existing consumers, and also to identify new consumers to introduce to their products and services. AdRoll does this by creating connected, personalized customer journeys that enable brands to reach new and existing customers through digital advertising, email marketing and onsite experiences, and helps companies understand the impact of their marketing efforts with advanced measurement and attribution;
RollWorks
offers an account-based platform for businesses who want to sell their products and services to other businesses (called “Business to Business” or “B2B” companies). Our RollWorks Services help B2B companies identify their target accounts and key buyers, reach those accounts across multiple channels and measure program effectiveness in their system-of-record.
The NextRoll websites are a collection of sites that we use to describe our Services to potential customers, to provide our Services to our Customers, and to support Customers and partners as they seek to identify, deploy and measure their marketing and advertising efforts with us over time.
For more information on the data collected through our Services, please see our
Service Privacy Notice
.
2. What Data We Collect
Back to top
We may collect the following categories of information on our Digital Properties and use them for the purposes explained below.
Data You Provide To Us
Contact Information:
You may provide us with your name, address, phone number and email when you set up an account with us and you may provide your name, title, company, email, address and/or phone number when you sign up for an event with us online or download content from our Digital Properties.
Account Information:
If you open an account, we will collect your username and password and other information necessary to open and access your account.
Customer Service Information:
Information you may provide to our customer service including your email address for purposes of responding to your inquiries and survey responses.
Financial Information:
Credit card number or other payment account information. This information is collected directly by our payments processor and not stored by NextRoll.
Hashed email addresses:
We collect hashed versions of the email addresses that you enter on our Digital Properties. Hashing is a technology process that pseudonymizes (i.e. digitally scrambles) email addresses. For instance, when joe_the_cat@nextroll.com is run through a typical hashing function, it becomes a string of digitsm such as: 0F0B7B1A1A7E8BDBBC6AA545F8CCD6F83671B32479271BFCB6CC8498912058D5. We take this step to de-identify data and protect email addresses. We use the hashed email  created for the purpose of recognizing you and sending your interest-based ads across different devices (computers, tablets and mobile devices) and browsers (also called “cross-device matching”). We describe cross-device matching in further detail in
How We Use the Data We Collect
.
Information about your business:
You may use the tools available on NextRoll’s Digital Properties to learn more about how NextRoll’s Services can help you grow your business.  If you are an existing Customer, we may use the information you provide about your business when using our online tools to add to your existing Customer profile with NextRoll.
Data We Automatically Collect From Your Device
Cookies:
A unique identifier that NextRoll assigns to you when visiting one of our sites so we can understand your online journey and have the opportunity to serve ads to you when you visit a publisher’s site.
Device Information:
This is technical information about the device you use to access our Digital Properties such as your operating system. Additionally, in the case of mobile devices, your device type, unique advertising identifier (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID) and any other unique identifier that may be assigned to the mobile device, such as an Android ID or UDID in older Apple phone models, or a non-cookie unique identifier used by
Non-Cookie Technologies
.
IP Address:
The IP address associated with the device you are using when visiting a NextRoll Digital Property.
Location Data:
This is non-precise information related to your geography derived from your device’s IP address. This does not reveal your precise geographic coordinates (i.e. your GPS latitude and longitude) - only country, state, city and zip/postal code, and helps us to display ads that are relevant to your general location (for example, showing ads in French if you are located in France).
Browser Data:
This is technical information about the browser you are using that is captured in order to serve you an ad that can be rendered on your device (for example, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).
Activity on our Digital Properties:
This is data about your browsing activity on our Digital Properties and your interactions with our other tools or dashboards. For example, which pages you visited and when, what items were clicked on a page, how much time was spent on a page or whether you downloaded a white paper.
Ad Data:
This is data about the online ads we have served (or attempted to serve) to you. This includes, for example, how many times an ad has been served to you, what page the ad appeared on and whether you clicked on or otherwise interacted with the ad.
All this data is collected to help make sure you get the best and most relevant experience when engaging with NextRoll.
Data We Collect from Third Party Sources
Data from Audience Partners:
We may collect additional information about you from our audience partners who create and provide us with segments of our own customers (“Audience Partner”). A segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g. firmographic attributes).  We use this data to better understand our target audience and to better market our Services to you.
Data from Advertising Partners:
This is data that allows us to match the NextRoll cookie identifier with identifiers that may already be used by other companies in the digital advertising ecosystem that we work with (“Advertising Partners”). For example, we work with ad exchanges, publishers and supply side platforms (i.e. companies that sell advertising space on publishers’ websites) in order to serve our ads. Matching cookie identifiers helps us deliver ads to you and recognize you across browsers and devices, and may include pseudonymous advertising identifiers (meaning identifiers that help identify your browser or device, but not you directly) which some Advertising Partners choose to share with us.
Contact Data from Third Parties:
We obtain and collect contact data from various third party sources, including from public sources and through licenses with data providers. This contact data is B2B information – in other words, it is typically a business email address, business street address, or sometimes, a business telephone number.
3. How We Use the Data We Collect
Back to top
Specifically, we use this data for:
Interest-Based Advertising:
Serving you ads for certain NextRoll Services that are more likely to be relevant to you based on your browsing activity, the time of day you visit our Digital Properties and the time you spend on them, and non-precise geographic data inferred about your device/s. For example, we may show you ads for our Service  only available in your city, region or country during your lunch or commute hours. For more information about how our Services work, please see our Service Privacy Notice.
Segmenting Audiences:
We use data from our Digital Properties you visit in addition to data from Audience Partners to segment you into groups (like high or low intent visitors) for reporting, analytics and determining what ads and email content would best peak your interest.
Ad delivery:
We use data about your browser or other technical information about your device in order to deliver advertising and confirm successful delivery of the ad.
Frequency Capping:
We use data about ads that have been served to you to make sure that you don't see the same NextRoll ad too many times.
Sequencing:
If you are being served a sequence of ads, we do this to make sure we show you the right ad next in the sequence.
Mapping Data to our Cross-Device Asset:
NextRoll cross-device asset is used to connect multiple devices to one person, household, and/or online identifiers such as an email address (hashed for security) that you may have submitted to NextRoll.  Our cross-device asset allows us to better understand your online activity and helps us improve our ability to target and measure ad campaigns (including limiting the number of times you or your household sees an ad for NextRoll Services).
Cross-Device Matching:
Identifying different devices and browsers that are likely to be associated with you so that ads can be targeted, capped and sequenced across those devices, and so that campaign effectiveness can be measured and analyzed. For example, cross-device matching helps us not show you ads for the shoes you were looking at on your phone but already purchased on your tablet. Instead we’ll try to show you ads for an upcoming triathlon where you can put those shoes to work. It also helps us match devices so we can honor your opt-out choices across all devices we know are connected to the opted-out cookie. You may opt-out of cross-device interest-based targeting by employing the respective opt-out techniques we describe in
Your Choices and Opting-Out of Targeted Ads
. To learn more about how we use cross-device matching, click
here
.
Syncing Online Identifiers with Customer CRM Data:
If you have provided us with your email address, we may match your online browsing activity indicated by online identifiers.  We may use this information to see if you are showing increased interest in our products and services to better understand our website audience and to respond with appropriate marketing activity.
Identifying Companies Associated with an IP Range for B2B Marketing:
We match IP address ranges to companies who disclose their IP address ranges to analyze and report our website traffic.
Reporting and Attribution:
Analyzing how our ads are performing and gaining insights into our Customers and prospective customers. Reporting may include ad metrics such as attribution (described above), impressions (ads served), clicks (ads you clicked on) and conversions (for example, if you create an account with us or download a white paper from our site). This helps us identify ads that are most useful to you and demonstrates NextRoll’s value. Relatedly, this also helps us identify an ad that is not performing well, allowing us to update our ad or ad campaign strategy.
Providing our Services and Customer Support:
For example, to monitor usage of features, manage campaigns and log data for audit purposes. We may contact you when you ask us for support or when it appears to us that you might need support. We maintain records of our communications with you for future reference.
Billing:
Invoice you and collect fees for services we have provided.
Troubleshoot Problems:
To monitor and fix our website performance, for example, if the site is slow, not loading properly, or to investigate aberrations in performance of our Services.
Prevent Potential Fraud and Enforce our Terms of Service:
To prevent fraud on our sites or through the use of our Services,to enforce our Terms of Service or other policies or investigate any potential violation of those Terms and policies, any potential violation of the law, or to protect ourselves, our Customers or any third party from any potential harm (whether tangible or intangible).
Customize, Measure and Improve our Websites and Services:
To provide customized content and to measure which content is most helpful (or unhelpful) to our Customers, which helps improve our website and our services. For example, if we notice higher visits to certain Help Center articles or receive higher customer support tickets for specific issues, we can improve our support materials or identify areas where we can make our product better for our Customers.
Contact You About Your Account or our Services, Including to Market our Services to You or Provide Updates:
We may use your contact information to contact you about your account, for example, in relation to the performance of your campaigns, to follow up on billing issues or to tell you about new Services we are offering. We may send you product updates, performance information, surveys or communicate with you in other ways about our services. When we can legally do so, we may augment the information you give us in order to contact you by phone or even snail mail. You can opt-out of receiving emails by unsubscribing through the link at the bottom of our emails or by updating your email preferences
here

Conducting Our Corporate Operations.
Data collected in our corporate capacity, such as our own B2B lists of Customers and prospective customers, is used to conduct our business operations and send communications.
Complying with Legal Process:
To satisfy in good faith any applicable law, legal process or proper governmental request, such as to respond to a subpoena (whether civil or criminal) or similar process.

7. Non-Cookie Technology for Tracking Outside European Territories
Back to top
In respect of website visitors with IP addresses
not from a European Territory
, NextRoll and some of our Advertising Partners may use technologies other than cookie technology to recognize your computer, device or browser for the purpose of interest-based advertising, analyzing engagement with ads or content, measuring the effectiveness of a particular ad campaign or marketing effort, monitoring against fraud or misuse of our Services, or in other ways described in this Website Privacy Notice in
How We Use the Data We Collect
. This use of non-cookie technology may be used in addition to cookies, or separately, to collect and record data about your web browsing activities on browsers, search engines or other platforms that may not utilize NextRoll Technology. You may opt-out of tracking via non-cookie technologies by employing the respective opt-out techniques described in
Your Choices and Opting- Out of Interest-Based Advertising and Analytics Ads
.
8. Your Choices and Opting-Out of Interest-Based Advertising and Analytics
Back to top
You can control how you share your data with NextRoll, including electing to “opt-out” of interest-based advertising altogether. Please visit our
opt-out webpage
to opt out.
Generally speaking, an opt-out allows you to direct NextRoll not to engage in a particular type of data collection.  There are many different ways that NextRoll collects data, different purposes for that data collection and different industry-specific and NextRoll-specific tools for opting-out.  We describe below the different options for controlling how NextRoll uses your data:
Web browser:
You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads served by us or on our behalf by clicking on the blue icon
that typically appears in the corner of the ads we serve and following the instructions provided or by clicking
here
. Please note that this opt-out function is browser-specific and relies on an “opt-out cookie.” This means if you delete your cookies or upgrade your browser after having opted out, you will need to opt-out again.
Cross Device Opt-Out:
As described above, How We Use the Data We Collect, we may link multiple browsers or devices to the cookie ID, hashed email address or other unique identifiers associated with you. If you opt-out on a browser or device and we have more browsers or devices linked to you, we will extend your opt-out decision to the other linked browsers and devices. Since we only link users across browsers and devices in some conditions, there could be cases where you are still being tracked in a different browser or device we have not linked, and where we are treating you as a different user.
Mobile Device Opt-Out:
To opt-out of receiving targeted ads that are based on your behavior across different mobile applications see the following instructions, for iOS and Android devices:
iOS 7 or Higher:
Go to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting; and
For Android devices with OS 2.2 or higher and Google Play Services version 4.0 or higher:
Open your Google Settings app > Select Ads > Enable “Opt-out of interest-based advertising.”
Industry Opt-Out Tools and Self-Regulation:
NextRoll is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the framework principles. You may use the NAI opt-out tool
here
, which will allow you to opt-out of seeing personalized ads from us and from other NAI approved member companies. In addition, the NAI opt-out tool allows you to separately opt-out of “audience matched” advertising through the NAI’s “Audience Matched Advertising Opt-Out” tool. You can also use the
email opt-out tool
provided by our Advertising Partner, LiveRamp, to opt your email address from their database. Audience matching is a particular type of interest-based advertising where de-identified data (e.g. hashed emails) is tied to “offline” activity or information (generally, information that is or can be associated with a consumer’s email address) and matches that de-identified data to cookies, mobile ad IDs or other online identifiers. We describe this hashing activity in detail in
What Data We Collect
. Because this “audience matched” information is derived from an email address or information that can be tied to an email address, it is possible to opt-out with an email address. However, when you opt-out in this way, you will need to submit all of the email addresses that you use for the opt-out to work.
We also comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). You may opt-out of receiving personalized ads from other companies that perform ad targeting services, including some that we may work with as Advertising Partners via the
DAA website
.
We also comply with the Canadian Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC). You may opt-out of receiving personalized ads from other companies that perform ad targeting services, including some that we may work with as Advertising Partners via the
DAAC website
.
Finally, we also adhere to the European Interactive Advertising Digital Alliance (EDAA) guidelines for online advertising. You may opt-out via the
EDAA website
.
You can also request that we stop email marketing to you. You can use the “unsubscribe link” in our marketing emails or contact
support@nextroll.com
.
9. Data retention
Back to top
We retain data for as long as necessary to perform our Services and for the purposes described in this Website Privacy Notice. For example, we may retain:
billing information as necessary to meet audit requirements;
login information to confirm when Customers accepted our Terms of Service; and
information as long as necessary to meet legal requirements, resolve disputes or enforce agreements.
We retain cookie data such as device and browser information, ad data and data collected on our Digital Properties as follows:
Mobile Identifiers and Cookie Identifiers:
Cookie identifiers we collect expire (and are then deleted) 13 months from the last time your device accessed a Digital Property using our technology. If you visit another Digital Property that uses NextRoll Technology inside that 13-month expiry period, then the expiry period will be reset and measured from that date instead. The expiration period for mobile identifiers is controlled by you on your device.
Personal Data Associated with Mobile and Cookie Identifiers Related to Browsing History:
We delete personal data associated with mobile and cookie identifiers after 12 months (for example, data such as a NextRoll Digital Property you visited or NextRoll ads that you may have clicked).
Personal Data Associated with Advertising Bidding Requests:
Data logged in order to process an advertising bid request we have received from an Advertising Partner (such as cookie identifier, IP address, the domain url requesting to display the ad and browser information) are deleted after 7 days. Data we have logged regarding bids we have placed to display an advertisement (including cookie identifiers, mobile identifiers, the advertisable bid on and the advertisable won or displayed to the visitor) are deleted after 15 days.
Personal Data Associated with the Display of an Advertisement:
Data logged for the display of an advertisement (including cookie identifiers, the advertisement won or displayed to you and data indicating whether you clicked on the particular advertisement displayed) are deleted after 12 months.
10. Security
Back to top
We apply technical, administrative and organizational security measures to protect the data we collect against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against other unlawful forms of processing.
11. International Transfers
Back to top
We may transfer the information we collect about you to countries (including the United States of America) other than the country where we originally collected it for the purposes of performing  our Services. In general, these countries will be the countries in which we or our service providers operate.
Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as your country. However, when we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Website Privacy Notice and take steps, where necessary, to ensure that international transfers comply with applicable laws.
For example, when we transfer your information from a European Territory (as defined below) to our parent company in the United States, we do so under the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses. When we transfer your data outside of a European Territory to Advertising Partners (or vice versa), we do so under lawful data export mechanisms which may include Standard Contractual Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules.
12. Information for European Territory Residents: Our Legal Basis and Your Rights
Back to top
Our Legal Basis:
If you are a visitor from the European Territories, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

Content marketing
: Distributing written or visual content relevant to your brand, such as sharing infographics on social media.
Account-based marketing (ABM)
: Tailoring marketing to consumer groups or individuals with a prior interest in your products or services.
Search engine optimization (SEO):
Creating or updating content that targets valuable keywords entered by target audiences into search engines, while meeting expectations for content quality, depth, and expertise.
Social media marketing:
Using the reach of social applications such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to promote your products, services, or talents within a particular industry niche.
What is account based marketing (ABM)?
Account-based marketing (ABM)
is a B2B marketing strategy that focuses on targeting best-fit accounts considered high-revenue opportunities rather than solely focusing on traditional, lead-based opportunities. With ABM, specific individuals within an account are targeted, and marketing efforts are coordinated with sales teams.
Generally, an account-based strategy is deployed when focusing on larger deal sizes or high-value accounts that typically have a longer sales cycle. It’s a more strategic approach to winning business and is especially important in B2B marketing efforts.
What is lead management?
Lead management
is a process of identifying potential customers and nurturing them through the conversion funnel to drive new business. Lead management systems organize those leads within your company’s sales funnel to tailor your sales and engagement tactics better.

Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to the collection and use of personal information is based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, taking into consideration the value of the offer itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may be realized by rewarding brand loyalty.

We automatically collect User Information when Users interact with our Services that appear on our Customers’ websites and digital properties. Like most other web-based services, we collect this User Information through cookies and other technologies. Taboola collects only pseudonymized data, which means we do not know who you are because we do not know or process your name, email address, or other identifiable data. Instead, we only process digital identifiers such as cookie IDs, IP addresses, mobile advertising IDs on your device, Taboola network browsing history and associated preferences, and in some limited circumstances, your hashed email address.
User Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to the following:
Content Discovery Platform

.
Tailoring content across multiple devices
. We may use User Information to improve a unique User’s experience across multiple browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or other viewing devices) by providing better targeted ad campaigns to that User. For instance, should we recognize a User on a web browser, we may want to provide that User similar or personalized content on mobile apps, as well. To do this, we identify unique Users across devices, or we may sync cookies and identifiers with our service providers or Customers that do this, to help our Customers enhance their own data and data segments, or to help them target the right audience.
Offering our Customers data segments that help target content and advertisements for topics, products, and services that may interest you.
A data segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g., travel enthusiasts). We offer a number of data segments, both proprietary and from our
data partners
, to our Customers so that they may better target Users who are more likely to be interested in their content and advertisements. Taboola does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data). In connection with our Services, our Customers may use these
standard health-related segments
about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or over the counter medications. In addition, Taboola offers our Customers
standard political-related segments
that may indicate general political sentiment, interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation.

programmatic demand and supply partners
, so that we can serve you with tailored advertisements.

. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies, your opt-out may not be effective, since we identify your choice to opt-out based on an opt-out cookie we deliver to you. In this case, you will need to confirm that your browser is configured properly in order for the opt-out to be effective. If you are using a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra, you must first adjust your Privacy and Security Settings to turn off both “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” and “Block All Cookies”, and then return to this privacy policy or your preferred opt out platform to reset your opt out preferences.
Taboola may use non-cookie technologies in limited cases. Like cookies, these technologies allow Taboola to recommend ads that are tailored to your interests and to remember whether you have chosen to opt-out from our Services. Please note that some web browsers may not permit you to block the use of non-cookie technologies, but you can do so by simply clicking on the Opt Out feature above in this Section 2.6.
You can also opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by Taboola and other advertising companies
.
You may use the
NAI opt out tool
, which will allow you to opt out of receiving targeted ads from Taboola and from other NAI-approved member companies. The NAI also provides instructions to engage system-level mobile device opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.
You may also visit one of the Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites to learn more about User choices and opting out of interest-based advertising displayed by the many member companies.
Users in the United States may visit the DAA consumer choice page at
www.aboutads.info/choices
Users in Canada may visit the DAAC consumer choice page at
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
Users in Europe (including the United Kingdom) may visit the EDAA consumer choice page at
www.youronlinechoices.eu
You can also opt out of the use of your email address for targeted ads through
Audience Matched Advertising
or AMA by Taboola and other advertising companies through the
NAI Audience Matched Advertising Opt Out (Beta)
.
Please note that an opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages will not prevent you from seeing those companies’ advertisements. Rather, the opt out will prevent these companies from using your Information to display targeted content or ads to you. You may continue to receive advertisements that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).
2.7 Data Retention
We retain User Information, which is directly collected for purposes of serving ads, for at most thirteen (13) months from the User’s last interaction with our Services (often for a shorter period of time), after which time we de-identify the data by removing unique identifiers or aggregating the data.
We retain deidentified or aggregated data, which cannot identify an individual or device and is used for purposes of reporting and analysis, for as long as commercially necessary. We keep opt-out information for longer than this period so that we can continue to honor your opt-out requests.
2.8 Children
We do not knowingly collect any data or target any advertisements on websites directed to children under the age of eighteen (18). If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of eighteen (18) and have a concern regarding the Information we collect, please contact us at

For more information about how we use cookies and other technologies, please refer to our
Cookie Policy
.
3.2 Why We Use Site Visitor Information
We use your Site Visitor Information for the following purposes:
Providing our Service
. We use Site Visitor Information to provide and manage our Sites and Services.
Tailoring content

Marketing and advertising

3.4 Third-Party Online Advertising
To understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests, we may work with service providers or third parties that use their own
cookies, web beacons, and other technologies
to collect Information about Site Visitors’ online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet  (“
Taboola Ad Partners
”). These Taboola Ad Partners include advertisers and ad networks that may collect Information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different websites. Like most advertisers, Taboola works to place our advertisements where we think they will be most interesting and relevant to the recipient. One way we do this is by allowing ad networks to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the ad network to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Taboola Sites. Then, if the ad network has purchased ad space on a third-party website, and recognizes that same individual visiting that third-party website, the ad network can deliver a Taboola advertisement, knowing that this individual has already expressed interest in Taboola by visiting the Taboola Sites. To learn more about third parties who collect Site Visitor Information, please review our
Cookie Policy
.
3.5 Site Visitor Choices
Site Visitors may opt out of the Taboola Ad Partners that collect information on the Sites to serve ads about Taboola. (Some U.S. Site Visitors may exercise their options directly with Taboola, as outlined below in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.3.1). By visiting one of the Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites, you can learn more about User choices and opting out of interest-based advertising displayed by the many member companies.
Users in the United States may visit the DAA consumer choice page at
www.aboutads.info/choices
Users in Canada may visit the DAAC consumer choice page at
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
Users in Europe (including the United Kingdom) may visit the EDAA consumer choice page at
www.youronlinechoices.eu
Please note that an opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages will not prevent you from seeing those companies’ advertisements. Rather, the opt out will prevent these companies from using your Information to display targeted content or ads to you. You may continue to receive advertisements that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).

EEA/UK Data
”) will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).
Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

When Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to Taboola.com Ltd. in Israel, it relies (as applicable) on (i) the European Commission’s decision, and (ii) UK adequacy regulations that Israel provides a level of data protection that is adequate for EEA/UK Data. These allow the free transfer of EEA/UK Data to Israel without the need for additional data transfer mechanisms.
Similarly, when Taboola transfers any personal data from the EEA to Taboola Europe Limited in the United Kingdom, it relies on the European Commission’s decision that the UK provides a level of data protection that is adequate for personal data from the EEA.
Beyond that, when Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to other countries then, if those countries do not have a European Commission adequacy finding and are not the subject of UK adequacy regulations (as applicable), Taboola implements
Standard Contractual Clauses
approved by the European Commission and/or competent UK authorities (as applicable) to protect the transferred data. The Standard Contractual Clauses are contractual privacy and security commitments that are entered between companies that transfer personal data outside of the EEA.
In particular, non-EEA/UK Taboola Affiliates, like Taboola, Inc. in the United States, have accordingly adopted Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure the legality, privacy, and security of the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated:
January 6, 2025
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg, Inc. (“Crazy Egg”, “we”, “us”, “our”) on our websites located at the domains crazyegg.com, crazyeggvcr.com, and crazyeggproxy.com, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate (individually and collectively, “Our Website” or the “Crazy Egg Website”).
Scope of this Privacy Policy
As further discussed, below, data protection laws, regulations, and directives in certain jurisdictions distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of “Controller(s)” of personal information or data (“Information”), from those who are “Processor(s)” of such Information or data on the applicable controllers’ behalf. Crazy Egg is generally the controller of Information that it collects from and about the persons and entities who are visiting Our Website (“Crazy Egg Visitors”), and this Privacy Policy applies to Crazy Egg Visitors.
We also provide certain services to commercial persons and entities (each, a “Client” and collectively, “Clients”), who, in turn, own and operate their own websites or mobile applications (“Client Site(s)”), and who wish to utilize our code, software and services and reports (the “Service(s)”) to analyze how third party visitors to their Client Sites (“Client Site Visitor(s)”) use, interact with, and engage their Client Sites. The applicable Clients are the Controllers of Information collected from their Client Site Visitors, whether or not such information is accessed, analyzed, or otherwise utilized by or on behalf of the Client via the Service (“Client Visitor Information”); Crazy Egg is not the Controller of such Client Visitor Information. This Privacy Policy applies to the use of Services by our Clients. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Client Sites themselves, nor to any Client Visitor Information. For any questions regarding the privacy, security, or other practices or policies on the Client Sites, please contact the applicable Client.
Information Collected from Crazy Egg Visitors
Device Information from Crazy Egg Visitors
We may receive and collect certain Information furnished by the visitor's browser or otherwise by their access device (“Device Information”), such as:
Browser Information
Operating System Information
Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)
IP address (stored in anonymized form)
Page Accessed
Geographic Location
Time of visit (by day, week, and duration)
Whether the visitor is a new or return visitor
Other such Information as may be delivered or shared by the applicable browser or access software or device.
Referral Information
We may also receive certain information regarding visitors from the prior website visited by such visitors (“Referral Information”). For instance, if a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from another website, Crazy Egg may receive certain information from the referring website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the Crazy Egg Website) as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request. For example, if a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from a search engine, Crazy Egg may receive information contained in the referring URL for the applicable search query, such as the terms the Crazy Egg Visitor was searching for before visiting the Crazy Egg Website.
Registration Information from Crazy Egg Clients
When Crazy Egg Visitors register as Clients to use the Crazy Egg Service, register to use a trial version of the Crazy Egg Service, or request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require Information, such as name, employer or company name, e-mail, mailing address, phone number, financial information (e.g., credit card number, billing address), and/or proposed Client Site to be tracked, to process the registration or request ("Client Registration Information").
Session Recording Information
We may use session recording software on the Crazy Egg Website. This software enables us to record Crazy Egg Visitors’ use, interaction, and engagement with the Crazy Egg Website. This software may capture user input, such as mouse and keyboard inputs and mobile gestures, and user views, such as browser or screen output. We use this software to help us optimize Crazy Egg Visitors’ experience. By using the Crazy Egg Website, you consent to our use of session recording software.
Crazy Egg’s Use of Crazy Egg Visitor Information
Crazy Egg may use Information of Crazy Egg Visitors, including Device Information and Referral Information of Crazy Egg Visitors and Client Registration Information, to:
authenticate Client’s access to the Crazy Egg Site, trial versions, or Service;
process and fulfill Client requests or purchases;
register Client accounts;
check the Crazy Egg Visitor’s qualifications for registration and/or to bill Crazy Egg Clients for the Services.
Crazy Egg may also use Client Information to:
provide Crazy Egg's products and Services, personalize and tailor your experience on the Crazy Egg Website;
operate our business;
understand how Clients are engaging with Crazy Egg Website and Service;
request additional information necessary to process or fulfill an order;
assess Client satisfaction with the Crazy Egg Service;
inform Clients that an upgrade is available; or to contact Clients with information about Crazy Egg, including information about new or existing products and services or special offers. For example, we may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our products and Services to the email address associated with a registered account.
Otherwise for our legitimate business interests.
If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, Crazy Egg may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data”.
Use of Cookies by the Service
As described in our Cookie Policy, the Service may utilize first-party cookies (small text files that Crazy Egg stores locally on a Client Site Visitor’s device) on Client Sites for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify whether a Client Site Visitor is a first time visitor, or has visited previously (provided that we will not store identifiers that can be used to personally identify such Client Site Visitors); assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify preferences; diagnose problems with our Service; analyze trends; and otherwise administer Crazy Egg products and services. Cookies placed by Crazy Egg on the computers of Client Site Visitors do not include Personally Identifiable Information such as name, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address, nor does Crazy Egg link cookies to such Personally Identifiable Information on our servers or databases.

Types of Client Visitor Information.

Recorded Interactions may also include images of the Client Site that are recorded during the Client Site Visitor’s interactions with such Client Site, such as, by way of example, images of forms displayed or populated by the Client Site Visitor on the Client Site, or other multimedia content that may be posted by Client Site Visitors. Such Client Visitor Information may also include Device Information and/or Referral Information from the Client Site Visitor.

Improving websites, for you.
Online businesses use Hotjar to create better website experiences.
Nobody wants to waste their time on a website that is confusing and hard to navigate.
You know it, we know it, and website owners know it too—which is why they turn to Hotjar.
Website owners use Hotjar to better understand user behavior: what actions people take on a website, what elements of a page they click or ignore, what they enjoy, where they struggle. With this insight, website owners can then make changes that improve the overall experience for all website users. And that includes you.

We record interactions, not your sensitive data.
Hotjar is designed for websites to get insights. And respect your privacy.
When you browse a website that has Hotjar installed, we collect data about your interactions (e.g. where you click, scroll your mouse, move in between pages) and use it to create visual representations of the experience. Website owners get these insights without tracking IP/MAC addresses-- the stuff that relates to the device you use.
Some Hotjar tools, like session recordings, reconstruct the individual actions you took during a website visit; others, like heatmaps, aggregate data points from you and hundreds of other visitors in one report.
But in all cases, by default, sensitive data that you might enter on the site (your credit card details or phone numbers) will never reach our servers: we cannot see it, and neither can the website owner. Hotjar customers viewing a session recording will only see asterisks (‘***’ ) instead of numbers.

Privacy FAQs.

We will never share or sell your data.
Not to advertisers. Not to third-party services. Not to anyone.
Nobody here at Hotjar likes the idea of tools following us around different websites or companies sharing and selling our data without our permission. We are committed to making sure this doesn’t happen to you, either.
Hotjar is designed to help make websites easier to use, and the data we track about your website visit (for example, what and where you click) is only used for this purpose. We don’t follow you around the Internet: website owners who use Hotjar cannot see or find out about your activity on sites they don’t own. Likewise, we don’t harvest personal data or sell it to anyone, ever, for any reason. Nor do we mine it for profiling or advertising purposes.

Privacy FAQs.

Request and access your data, anytime.
Your data is stored securely, and you can ask to see it whenever you want.
As a website visitor, you have the right to request access to the personal identifiable information a website owner collected and stored about you. You also have the right to request that this information is deleted.
At any time, you can request a website owner who uses Hotjar to give you access to your data. They can run a search for personal data from inside the Hotjar dashboard; the system will then generate and email you a report that lets you view, and delete, any data connected with you.

Tracking: we'll always give you options.
If you prefer websites not to track data about your visit, we can help.
If you prefer websites not to track data about your visit, we can help.
If you want to stop a website using Hotjar from collecting data about your visit, you should know that the website owner is responsible for getting your consent to collect and process data about your visit (and must allow you to withdraw that consent as well).
But we understand that you might want Hotjar (and other tools) to not process data about you regardless of whether a site owner asks for permission or not, so we want to give you an extra option. If you put a ‘Do Not Track’ flag on your browser, Hotjar will look for it before we collect any data about your site visit. Not everybody does that, but we do.
For more information about this take a look at our
guide on how ‘Do Not Track’ in your browser works

Compliance commitment: GDPR, CCPA, and more.
Our customers can use Hotjar in a compliant manner, for you.
We have followed a ‘privacy by design’ approach since our very first day, back in 2014, so we’re big supporters of privacy acts and regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) that enhance your privacy rights and protection as a consumer.
We have built the necessary controls around anonymity and consent to make sure website owners who use Hotjar can do it in a compliant manner. Plus, our legal team is fully committed to keeping up-to-date with any changes in the law and making sure they are reflected in our product.
You can read more about GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and our other commitments over in our
