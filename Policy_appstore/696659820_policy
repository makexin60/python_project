17 Ramadan, The Day of Sayyidah Aishah Siddiqah رَضِیَ اللهُ تَعَالٰی عَنْها
As a child, Sayyidah Aishah Siddiqah رَضِیَ اللهُ تَعَالٰی عَنْهَا  was greatly interested in swinging and playing with dolls. During a visit to Saayiduna Abu Bakr Siddique, Prophet Muhammad صلی اللہ  علیہ وسلم saw her playing with dolls and swinging.

FAMOUS QUOTES
INSPIRING WORDS TO UPLIFT YOUR DAY
Here you may read the famous Islamic quotes. Take a moment to reflect, be inspired and let spiritual words guide you.
The Holy Prophet صَلَّی اللہ علیہ واٰلہٖ وسلَّم  said
“This is the month of consoling and goodness. The wealth of a believer increases in this month. Feeding the fasting person in this month is a means to have his sins forgiven, and he will be safe from the fire of Hell. The one who provides Iftar will gain reward equivalent to the reward of the one observing fast. There will be no deficiency in his reward.”
Sayyiduna Kabal - Ahbaar رضی اللہُ عنہ Said :
On the Day of Judgement, Someone will make an announcement:  "Everyone will be given reward equal to their actions, except for the scholars of the Quran and the fasting people. They will receive endless rewards."
The Holy Prophet  صَلَّی اللہ علیہ واٰلہٖ وسلَّم said
“Spend with an open hand in the month of Ramadan because it is like spending in the way of Allah”.
