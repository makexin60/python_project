2. Use of Information
2.1 Personal Identifiable Information (PII): As stated earlier, Conjuu does not collect any personal identifiable information at the moment. Therefore, we do not use any PII for any purpose.

This information may also be used for statistical purposes and to enhance the overall user experience.
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

4. Data Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of the information we collect. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
