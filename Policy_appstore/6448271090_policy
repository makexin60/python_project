Your Rights
Some jurisdictions’ laws grant specific rights to users of the Game Services.
Please refer to the Supplemental Jurisdiction-Specific Terms, or the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, for an overview of specific rights that apply to persons subject to data protection laws in the listed jurisdictions and how these can be exercised.
You may have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below). You can exercise some of these rights directly by accessing and updating the information in your account. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you, please
contact us
.
Access
You may have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your account.
Portability
You may have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. For example, in certain jurisdictions this can comprise personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., survey information) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., account name), as described above in the section “
How We Use Your Personal Information
”.
We will provide further information to you about transferring this data if you make such a request.
Correction
You may have the right to correct personal information we hold that is inaccurate. You can access the personal information we hold about you by logging into your account.
Erasure

Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Game Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.
Restriction of Processing to Storage Only
You may have a right to require that we stop processing the personal information we hold about you (other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances). Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). Where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will take steps to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.
Objection
You may have the right to object to our processing of your personal information. If you wish to do so, please contact us
using the contact details at
Section 8 (Contact)
, and
we will consider your request
.
Consent Withdrawal
To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw consent you previously provided to us for certain processing activities by contacting us at
Section 8 (Contact)

Announcements
We may from time to time send you announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (for example, when we temporarily suspend access to the Game Services for maintenance, or security, privacy or administrative-related communications).

INFORMATION FOR PARENTS
Before your child can use the Game Services, you will need to provide your consent to approve your child’s account set-up and the processing of their personal information.
What personal information does the Game Services process?
The Game is a mobile game.
If your child successfully signs up to the Game Services, this will result in the collection and sharing of certain personal information:
·
Log-in information: Open ID, and other information if relevant, such as email address.
·
Customary device and network information: such as IP address, connection speed, device specifications, as well as app- and OS-generated identifiers.
·
Customer support information: such as details of ticket, complaint and handling, name, open ID, device and network information.
·
Game data, crash and analytics information.
You can review our
Privacy Policy
for more details on what personal information we collect and how we use and process the information.
Does the Game Services process personal information differently for children?
Children will not be able to access free chat function and can only communicate using the quick chat function by selecting pre-set text messages. Children will also not be able to use real-time voice chat and voice messages recording function.
Why is my consent required?
Certain jurisdictions requi
re or recommend the consent of a parent or legal guardian before their child can sign up to a game such as the Game Services, where personal information will be processed. If you do not consent, or withdraw your consent, we will immediately delete any personal information collected up to that point.
What method(s) can I use to verify my child’s account?
In some jurisdictions, including the United States, we ask for date of birth at registration. We will not allow a child to sign-up without first obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or legal guardian. As part of this, we need to verify that you are an adult capable of providing such consent. To do this, we charge or authorize a small amount to a credit card. We do not process your credit card information – only the third party payment processor collects credit card information. The credit card information is not retained for any reason, including future purchases or connected to in-app payment functions (if any) in the game.
What if there are changes to the Game Services
in the future?
If we make any changes to the way their personal information is processed, we will notify you of those changes. You must consent to those changes before your child’s personal information will be processed for that new purpose.
Will you retain my personal information?
We will keep a record of your email address so that we can notify you of any changes to the processing of your child’s personal information, and so that we know you are a parent or legal guardian of a player when you contact us. As mentioned above, your credit card information is not processed by us, but instead only processed by a third party payment processor. We do not have access to your credit card information.
What if I do not consent?
If you do not
consent (including by providing your credit
card details for verification) then your contact information will be deleted.
How do I withdraw my consent or delete my child’s account?
You can withdraw your consent or delete your child’s account by emailing us at
dpo_tarisland@proximabeta.com
. You can also request a copy of your child’s personal information at any time.
