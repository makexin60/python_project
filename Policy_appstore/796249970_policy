This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) explains how we collect, use, and share information, including personal information when you use or access our website and when you purchase a license online (collectively, the “Kiteworks Website”) as an actual or potential Customer (each a “Customer”) or when you engage with us directly.

We respectfully use appropriate personal information in order to market, sell, deliver, and support the solutions that we offer.
We do not collect personal information that is unnecessary for the marketing, selling, delivery, and support of our solutions, such as demographic, biometric, medical, or social information.
We are a Controller of limited, non-sensitive personal information, for the expressly legitimate purposes of direct marketing, selling, delivering, and supporting the Kiteworks Website. Our systems, employees, contractors, and affiliates cannot access personal information collected from our customers even when that information may be contained in customer applications which use the Kiteworks Website under the control of customers.
We do not sell or share with third parties the information that we collect, except sharing of information with limited reputable partners involved in the direct selling of our solutions and for the specific purpose of selling our solutions, and with vendors who provide us information management solutions used by us under our control. We periodically appoint digital marketing agents to conduct marketing activity on our behalf; such activity may result in the compliant processing of personal information.
We use standard industry practices to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information we collect.
We will only retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. For personal data processed according to your consent, we will keep it until you withdraw your consent.
The specific information that we collect and how we use it reflects the nature of your relationship with us.
We will not have a direct relationship with individuals whose personal information is controlled by Customers and used in connection with Kiteworks Software. Accordingly, if you are an end user and you contact us about your personal information controlled by a Customer, we will direct you to the Customer for any questions or requests with respect to your personal information controlled by them.

Personal information You Provide to Us
We receive personal information from you when you request information from us, when you register or log in to use the Kiteworks Website, when you use our mobile applications, when you submit customer support requests, or when you agree to provide testimonials for us to make publicly available. The types of personal information collected will depend on the purpose, but may include personally identifiable information such as your full name, address, company, email address, and telephone number. If you order products from us through our website, personal information can include any financial and commercial information you provide for that purpose. And we may collect personal information about you such as location information, device identifiers, or IP addresses, depending on the context in which it is collected.
Personal information is used for providing the Kiteworks Website to you, for customer support requests, to contact you as requested, or for agreed-upon testimonials. We may also use personal information to communicate with you about news and information regarding the Kiteworks Website, to operate, maintain, and improve the Kiteworks Website, to facilitate your use of the Kiteworks Website, to investigate and prevent fraud and other illegal activities.
Information Collected Automatically
We may receive and store certain types of non-personal information whenever you interact with our website, or our desktop and mobile applications that are part of the Kiteworks Website. For example, for website visitors, Kiteworks may choose to automatically receive and record information about your browser, your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, the numbers and frequency of visits to our site and its components. In addition, we may also record the pages you visit on the website through the use of pixel tags (also called “clear gifs” or “beacons”) and we may use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences.
For mobile application users, we may receive data about the version of the mobile application you’re using, the device type and operating system on which it is used, language used, general geographic location data (not lat/long), and settings and events in the mobile application.
Further, if we contact you by email, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Kiteworks if your computer supports this type of program.
Kiteworks generally only uses this data in aggregate form: that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. However, if you have registered with Kiteworks using our site and your browser accepts cookies, or where we have deployed pixel tags and/or LSOS, Kiteworks may automatically collect individualized information regarding your visits to Kiteworks’s site (“Individual Site Usage Information”) to provide you with a more personalized customer experience. If you are interested in preventing the collection of Individual Usage Information, please see the “What About Cookies” section below for further information.
What about Cookies?

If you do not wish to have your Individual Site Usage Information collected, most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. Also, various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Please be aware that disabling those tools may reduce your ability to access certain portions of the Kiteworks website. You may also have additional rights as a user of the Kiteworks Website, as provided in the “Additional Rights” section below.
