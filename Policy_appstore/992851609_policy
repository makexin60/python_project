If you decide to send photos to your nurse, these will be uploaded onto your electronic notes and deleted off the nurse’s phone on the same working day. If you send photos to your nurse out of hours or on a non-working day, these will be uploaded to your electronic notes on the nurse’s next working day and deleted off their phone. Your nurse will ask for consent to upload your details/photos at your first visit, but you can withdraw this consent at any time.
Messages will not be read during non-working hours and should not be used for urgent queries. Be mindful if your nurse does not respond to your message, you should call instead, as they may not be at work but will have a useful contact number on their voicemail. In cases of emergency, you should always contact either your GP, dial 111 or 999 as appropriate.
