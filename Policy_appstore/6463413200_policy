Our App may display advertisements from third-party providers, such as AdMob. These advertisements may be personalized based on interests, demographics, and other data. To deliver personalized ads, AdMob may use identifiers, including the advertising identifier on your device. You can manage your ad personalization settings on your device or at adssettings.google.com.
For more details about AdMob and their privacy practices, please review their Privacy Policy - https://policies.google.com/privacy.

We may use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics services to improve our App's functionality and performance. These services may collect device identifiers, such as the Android Advertising ID and the Advertising Identifier, to generate analytics and crash reports.
