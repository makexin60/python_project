    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Effective date: January 01, 2019</p>

    <p>Eric ("I", "me", or "my") operates the Parrity mobile application (hereinafter referred to as "Parrity").</p>

    <p>This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use my Service and the choices you have associated with that data.<br>
    This Privacy Policy for Parrity is loosely based on the <a href="https://termsfeed.com/blog/sample-privacy-policy-template/">TermsFeed's Privacy Policy Template</a>.</p>

    <h2>Definitions:</h2>

            <p><strong>Personal Data</strong></p>
            <p>Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in my possession or likely to come into my possession).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Usage Data</strong></p>
            <p>Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of a Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).</p>

            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>Cookies are small files stored on your device (computer or mobile device).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Collection and Usage:</h2>
    <p>I collect no Personal Data or Usage Data at this time, and store no Cookies of my own.  Because Parrity relies upon an Apple-provided UIWebView, and its core intention is to provide complete unrestricted internet browsing access, I can bare no responsibility for the Personal Data or Usage Data collected by third parties, or the cookies they employ.  Please browse with caution.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any substantial changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
    <p>I will let you know via email (if provided) and/or a notice listed within the App's update notes prior to the change becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
