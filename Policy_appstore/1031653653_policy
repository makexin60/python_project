            July 27, 2023
Byzantine Apps, LLC, a
            Georgia limited liability company (“Byzantine,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides
            this privacy notice (“Privacy Notice”) to explain how we or others collect,
            use, store, and share information about individuals in two different contexts
            (we refer to such individuals  as “you,” “your,” and “yourself”): (1) visitors
            to this website located at
byzantineapps.io
and any other website on which this Privacy Notice is allowed to
            be posted or linked (such individuals, “Visitors”, and such websites
            collectively, the “Site”); and (2) End Users of Byzantine’s owned and operated
            mobile applications (“Byzantine Apps” or “Apps”).  This Privacy Notice also
            explains how we enable certain third parties to collect information directly
            from End Users of our Apps, as well as certain choices you may have regarding
            how we use information about you and rights you may have to access or correct
            such information.
If you are located in
            the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or the United Kingdom and would
            like to review your rights under the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR (collectively
            referred to in this Privacy Notice as the “GDPR”), please go to
Section 5
of this Privacy Notice. If you are a resident of California or Virginia, or certain other states,
            you may review your rights under your state laws at
Section 7
of
            this Privacy Notice.
Below, we explain
            certain terms that we will use in this Privacy Notice that may make it easier
            to understand:
●
SDK
or
Software
            Development Kit
: An SDK is a block of computer code owned by certain Third
            Party Data Collectors that we can integrate with our apps to enable those Third
            Party Data Collectors to collect certain data, which is often useful to the
            mobile advertising and other data industries.
●
Third Party
            Data Collector
:  A third party that (1) owns or operates an SDK that is
            integrated with one or more Byzantine Apps and (2) directly collects information
            from End Users of the Apps through integration of such SDK.
●
Visitors
: Individuals
            who visit or use our Site.
●
End Users
: Individuals
            who download and use one or more of the Byzantine Apps on their Device.
●
Devices
:
            Internet-connected mobile devices such as Apple iPhones that use iOS or Samsung
            Galaxy devices that use Google’s Android OS.
●
Byzantine Apps
or
Apps
:
            Mobile applications owned and operated by Byzantine, including
WTForecast and Backseat Navigator.
●
Advertising ID
: A unique
            alphanumeric string randomly assigned by operating system manufacturers to each
            Device. Advertisers may use this ID to serve your Device more personalized
            advertising.  Examples of Advertising IDs include iOS IDFAs and Android
            Advertising IDs.
●
Installation ID
: A unique
            alphanumeric string randomly assigned by certain Apps to a Device but 
            which is not used for advertising purposes.
●
App Tracking
            Transparency/Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads
: Features on iOS or
            Android Devices that allows users to disable or limit the Apps’ ability to
            access the Advertising ID on your Device.
1. Summary: Who is Byzantine?
Byzantine’s primary
            business is the ownership and operation of mobile applications.  We also
            maintain websites related to the mobile applications that we offer.  As
            described further below, we typically do not collect any personal information
            from End Users of the Byzantine Apps, but we do facilitate collection of such
            information
by Third Party
            Data Collectors.  Additionally, we may collect certain personal information
            that Visitors to our Site may choose to provide.
2. Information Collection
A. Information
            We Collect Through Our Apps
We do not directly
            collect personal information from End Users of our Apps.  However, we may
            collect or receive certain aggregated, deidentified, or anonymous data related
            to usage of our Apps, primarily for the purpose of troubleshooting problems,
            reviewing how our Apps are being used by End Users, and other analytical or
            internal purposes.  A full description of our use of this data can be found in
Section 4
below.  Additionally, we enable certain third party vendors to
            collect aggregated, deidentified, or anonymous information regarding usage of
            our Apps for the purpose of providing analytic reports to us, e.g., regarding
            the frequency and cause of one or more Apps crashing.
B. Information
            Third Party Data Collectors Collect Through Our Apps
We allow certain,
            authorized Third Party Data Collectors to collect data (including personal
            information) directly from End Users of our Apps, via integration of these
            third parties’ SDKs into the Apps.  (In other words, we facilitate the Third
            Party Data Collector’s collection of certain information from you, but we do
            not receive or have access to the information they collect.)  When you use an
            Byzantine App that has integrated with a third party SDK (whether you are actively
            using the App or allowing it to run in the background), the Third Party Data
            Collector can collect information through or about your Device.  The
            information that may be collected by Third Party Data Collectors includes some
            or all of the data elements listed below.  However, you should visit each Third
            Party Data Collector’s privacy policy for complete details on what information
            they collect and how they use such information.  Please see Section 2.C for
            instructions on how to access such privacy policies.

Specific
            geolocation of the Device, usually described by latitude-longitude coordinates
            compiled through GPS features of the SDK, WiFi connection information, cell
            tower triangulation and other methods.
■
Dwell time
            within or in proximity to points of interest (
i.e.
, the length of time
            your Device stayed at one place).

            technologies that indicate the proximity of a Device. For example, certain
            brick-and-mortar stores use beacons that sense when a Bluetooth-enabled Device
            is in proximity to the beacon (
i.e.
, when a Device user enters the
            store). Retail locations, sports arenas, restaurants, museums and other similar

C. How Third Party Data Collectors Use Information Collected
            Through Our Apps
The Third Party Data
            Collectors who collect information through our Apps may use such information in
            the manner set forth in their respective privacy policies.  Generally, these
            Third Party Data Collectors may use information collected from or about End
            Users or Devices to (a) to customize and measure ads in apps and other
            advertising; (b) for app and user analytics; (c) for disease prevention and

To respond
                 to data subject requests.
As stated previously, we only collect (1) information that
            Visitors to our Site choose to provide and (2) aggregated, deidentified or
            anonymous information related to usage of our Apps (which information does not
            identify an individual End User or Device).  We may share such information with
            other parties, as follows:
With Our Affiliates:
○
In the event we
            establish a subsidiary or otherwise become affiliated with another company, we
            may share any information that we have collected with those entities.
In Relation to Legal Proceedings or
                 Process:
○
We may share
            information we have collected when we have a legal obligation to do so. This
            may include compliance with a binding court order, exercising, establishing or
            defending Byzantine’s legal rights, or those of our customers or any other third
            party, or in good faith to comply with the requirements of any applicable law

            the same. We may also share information to investigate any potential violations
            of the law, to defend ourselves, our customers, or any third party from any
            potential harm (whether tangible or intangible).
In Relation to a Corporate
                 Transaction:
○
If a third party seeks to acquire or actually acquires our
            business or assets in whole or in part, we may disclose information we have
            collected in connection to that transaction (including, without limitation,
            during due diligence that may be undertaken in advance of possible sales).
The Third Party Data Collectors who
            collect information through our Apps may share the information as described in
            their own privacy policies.  Please see Section 2.C for instructions on how to
            access such privacy policies.
F. User Choices & Opt-Out Tools
You can manage the way
            that we and third parties use information collected from or about you as
            described below:
Browser Settings
: You may
                 adjust the privacy and security settings of your web browser to change how
                 your browser uses cookies.  At this time, our Site does not place or use
                 cookies.
Opting Out of
                 Interest Based Advertising via NAI or DAA
: You can opt out
                 tailored advertising on mobile devices by companies that participate in
                 the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance by
                 visiting the
NAI’s opt-out page
or the
DAA’s Consumer Choice Page
. Residents of the
                 EEA, UK and Switzerland may refer to

. The
                 opt-out tools provided on these industry pages are generally based on
                 cookie technologies.  As such, if you delete your cookies (or change or
                 update your web browser), you will need to repeat the opt out process.
                 While our Site does not currently use cookie technology, we are providing
                 this information because we may partner with businesses to tailor ads for
                 our Site or Apps that do. Further, the Third Party Data Collectors may use
                 information they have collected from our Apps to match identifiers across
                 devices – such as to tie a mobile Advertising ID by common IP address to a
                 browser-based cookie ID.

                 Collectors use certain information they have collected by submitting an
                 opt-out request through their respective opt out form that is typically
                 accessible in the third party’s privacy policy.  Please see Section 2.C
                 for instructions on how to access such privacy policies.
Our
                 Marketing Emails
: If you receive marketing or promotional
                 emails from us, you may opt out of receiving those messages by following
                 the “unsubscribe” instructions contained in them, or by emailing us with
                 your request at
privacy@byzantineapps.io
. If you
                 opt out of our marketing and promotional messages, you may still receive
                 transaction- or service-related emails about your business relationship
                 with us.
3. Security
We use commercially
            reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect our
            physical infrastructure as well as in our computer systems, databases, and
            communications networks. These measures are intended to protect our systems
            (and the information contained therein) from loss, misappropriation, misuse,
            alteration or disclosure.  No method of electronic transmission or storage is
            perfectly secure, however, so we cannot guarantee the security of information
            we collect with absolute certainty.
4. Cross-Border Data Transfers
Information we and our
            authorized third parties collect may be stored and processed by us in the
            European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. When you use the
            Site or our Apps, the information we collect may be stored in or (if
            applicable) transmitted to the United States. Privacy laws in the United States
            and laws in certain other countries regarding the processing of personal
            information may not be as robust as those in your country.
5. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GDPR is a data
            protection law that applies to individuals located within the European Economic
            Area and Switzerland (under the EU GDPR) and in the United Kingdom (under the
            UK GDPR).  Pursuant to the GDPR, we are required to provide certain information
            about the processing of “Personal Data” of users in European Economic Area, the
            United Kingdom, and Switzerland who choose to provide such information when
            visiting our Site.  “Personal Data” generally refers to data that identifies or
            is capable of identifying a particular person directly or indirectly though
            their Device.  Names, addresses, cookie IDs, Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, and precise
            location information are common examples of “Personal Data.”
If you have any
            questions about Byzantine’s data practices in the context of the GDPR, you may
            contact our Data Protection Officer by emailing your questions to
privacy@byzantineapps.io
.
The representations and
            information we provide below, which are applicable only to individuals located
            in the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, are provided for purposes of compliance
            with the GDPR. Please do not rely on the information below if you are not
            located in one of those regions.  All capitalized terms used in this Section
            but not defined elsewhere in this Privacy Notice have the means set forth in
            the EU GDPR or UK GDPR, as applicable.
Legal grounds for
                 processing your Personal Data
: Under the GDPR, we must disclose
                 the legal bases we rely on to process Personal Data that you choose to
                 provide when visiting our Site. Byzantine’s legal bases for processing
                 Personal Data for the purposes we describe in Section 2.E, above, include:
○
Consent
. We rely on your consent to provide our Services that use precise location information 
                related to other Personal Data.  We also rely on your consent to store and access information on your 
                Device (e.g., Advertising IDs and Installation IDs). Our reliance on consent is in turn often in reliance 
                on compliance steps required of and taken by our data suppliers and by Clients that use the Services. 
                These steps are intended to confirm that your consent is collected in compliance with the GDPR and passed on 
                to Clients and business partners such that we only facilitate the collection of data in compliance with the law. 
                We may rely on your consent to process Personal Data in other circumstances as well. When we do so, we will follow 
                applicable laws pertaining to providing and withdrawing consent. We also attempt to obtain consent for certain of 
                our clients to process Personal Data. These Clients, in turn, may be independent data controllers as to data in 
                their own possession and control.
○
Legitimate
            interest
. We may rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for
            processing Personal Data in some cases. We may do so when we use Personal Data
            for purposes of maintaining the security of our services (including to detect
            and prevent fraud or to facilitate the detection and correction of bugs or
            other errors) or use Personal Data provided by Site Visitors to respond to
            their inquiries. We also rely on legitimate interest when we analyze user
            activity on our Site or Apps.
○
Contractual
            Agreements
. In some cases our basis for processing Personal Data is that
            the processing is necessary pursuant to a contractual relationship we have
            entered into.
○
Legal
            Obligations
. We may process Personal Data when it is necessary for us to
            comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
Transfers of
                 Personal Data
: When we collect Personal Data in the EEA, UK, or
                 Switzerland, and then transfer it outside of those jurisdictions, we take
                 measures to ensure that such Personal Data is protected by appropriate
                 safeguards.  In general, our transfers of Personal Data rely on Standard
                 Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements to safeguard that data
                 where the GDPR or other European data protection laws require it. You may
                 use the contact information below to request more information regarding
                 how we safeguard your Personal Data and respect your privacy rights.
○
How We Retain
            Personal Data
: We generally retain Personal Data we collect for as long as is
            necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, dispute resolution, and to
            enforce our contracts. We may also retain information insofar as we have a
            legal or operational need to do so, for example, for purposes of auditing,
            corporate record-keeping, legal compliance, accounting, security and
            bug-prevention purposes.
Rights of Data
                 Subjects
: Data Subjects have certain rights in connection with the
                 Personal Data that data controllers process about them pursuant to the
                 GDPR. These include the right to access Personal Data, the right to
                 request correction of inaccurate Personal Data, the right to request the
                 restriction of processing of Personal Data, the right to request deletion
                 of Personal Data, and the right to object to processing of Personal Data.
                 We describe these rights more fully below.
○
Right to Access
: You may
            contact us at
privacy@byzantineapps.io
in order to exercise
            your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller. We will
            respond to your request by explaining the steps you must follow to access your
            Personal Data after we receive your request. Because we are required to verify
            the identity of the individual making a request before we provide access to
            Personal Data, we will evaluate requests to exercise certain rights to access
            Personal Data on a case-by-case basis. In conducting this evaluation, we may
            consider both (1) the effort involved in verifying whether Personal Data that
            we process actually pertains to the data subject making the request – and only
            to that data subject; and (2) any potentially negative consequences that may
            result from erroneously releasing Personal Data to an individual other than the
            data subject. We may also limit the amount or kind of Personal Data we will
            release in circumstances where we believe it is likely that the improper
            release of Personal Data would adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms
            of the data subject. We will only honor requests for access to Personal Data
            for which we act as a data controller, as explained more fully in sub-section
            (d) below. Where we act as a processor for Personal Data on behalf of another
            entity (for example, our customers), you may contact that company instead of
            Byzantine to make a data access request.
○
Right to
            Correct
: You may exercise your right to correct Personal Data by
            contacting us using the contact information provided below.
○
Right to
            Withdraw your Consent or Object to our Personal Data Processing
:  You may use
            the opt-out methods described in
Section
            6
of this Privacy Notice to withdraw your consent for our
            processing of your Personal Data (when we are relying on your consent). If you
            withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your Personal Data within 30
            days or fewer.
○
Right to
            Request Deletion
: You have the right to request that we delete Personal
            Data concerning you that we process as a controller. If you use the opt-out
            process described above, we will also delete your Personal Data. You may also
            contact us at
privacy@byzantineapps.io
to request that we
            delete your Personal Data.  We will provide further instructions on how you can
            exercise your right to deletion after we receive your email request. In certain
            circumstances we may keep copies of Personal Data in back-up files (or
            otherwise in inactive form), for certain of our internal purposes that are
            important to our business, including legal, auditing, accounting and billing,
            bug-detection and correction. We may keep such backups for as long as is
            necessary to fulfill those purposes.
○
Right to Make
            Complaints
: You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our
            processing of Personal Data with a relevant data protection authority. If you
            have a complaint, please contact us first to allow us to assist you in
            resolving it.
Byzantine may
                 act as a data “controller” as defined in the GDPR in connection with the
                 Personal Data we process when you provide it on this Site. We may also be
                 deemed to act as an independent controller that enables certain Third
                 Party Data Collectors who are controllers to directly collect Personal
                 Data through their SDKs integrated with our Apps.  While we may be deemed
                 to act as an independent controller, only such Third Party Data Collectors
                 directly collect, have access to, and process your information. 
                 Therefore, if you submit any requests or inquiries to us regarding
                 information collected by one of these authorized third parties, we will
                 forward such submittal to the appropriate Third Party Data Collector for
                 fulfillment.
6. Children’s Data
We do not intend for
            our Site or Apps to be used in connection with minors under the age of 16, and
            we do not intentionally collect data from them. If you believe that we may have
            inadvertently collected of any such data, please use the contact information
            provided in
Section
            9
below to let us know.
7. Additional Information for Residents of California,
             Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia
California residents have certain privacy rights pursuant 
            to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018  as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”), 
            and Virginia residents have similar privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act of 2019 (“VCDPA”), 
            with respect to their personal information or personal data about them, Residents of Colorado, Connecticut or Utah 
            will have similar rights on various effective dates during 2023 under either the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA” effective July 1, 2023), 
            the Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (“CTDPA” effective July 1, 2023), or the Utah Consumer 
            Privacy Act (“UCPA” effective December 31, 2023)
Under the CCPA “Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, 
                or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Similarly, under the VCDPA, 
                “Personal Data” means any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. 
                When we use the term “personal information” in the following sections, we mean either your Personal Information under the CCPA 
                if you are a California resident or your Personal Data under the VCDPA if you are a Virginia resident, or the similar definitions 
                of Personal Data or Personal Information that apply if you are a resident of Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia.
If you are a resident of any of these states, this section of the Privacy Notice applies to you insofar as we have collected 
                personal information about you , or have sold such information. However, if you are not a resident of such a state, you should 
                not rely on the information we provide in this section as it does not apply to you. The information we provide here supplements 
                the information we provide in the other sections of this Privacy Notice.
As required by
            the CCPA and VCDPA, and other applicable state laws when they become effective, we describe the personal information we collect about
            residents of those states, and the purposes for which we may use it, in the following sections:
A. Categories
            of Personal Information We Collect; How We Use It; and How We Share with Third
            Parties
We may collect the
            categories of personal information about you described below. The table also

C. Rights and Choices of Certain US States Residents
If you are a resident of certain states you have the right under applicable data privacy laws 
            to request (1) that we disclose what personal information we collect from you; 
            (2) to delete such information; and (3) to opt out of our sale of their personal information. 
            The states that provide these rights to their residents are California (under the CCPA), Colorado (under the CPA effective 7/1/2023), 
            Connecticut (under the CTDPA effective 7/1/2023), Utah (under the UCPA effective 12/31/2023), and Virginia (under the VCDPA). These 
            rights are subject to certain limitations, although you will not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. 
            In certain circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee to process your request to the extent permitted by law.
Right to Opt-out of the Sale of
                    Your Personal Information:
○
California or Virginia
                residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. 
                Colorado, Connecticut or Utah residents may opt out as well when their laws become effective. 
                “Sale” is defined broadly by the CCPA, the CPA, and the CTDPA to include making personal information 
                available in exchange for any “monetary or other valuable consideration.” “Sale” is defined under the UCPA 
                and the VCDPA to mean the disclosure of personal data for “monetary consideration”.
We do not “sell” personal information.
However, certain of
                our authorized third parties that directly collect End User information may
                sell information.  You can exercise your right to opt out of such sale by
                visiting the applicable third party’s privacy policy.  Please see Section 2.C
                above for information on how to access each third party’s privacy policy.
Right to Request Deletion of Your
                    Personal Information:
○
If we have
                collected personal information from you, you may request that we delete such
                personal information.  A request to delete is distinct from a request to “opt
                out” of our sale of your personal information.  You may contact us via email at
privacy@byzantineapps.io
or call us toll-free
                at
+1-855-721-3550
to exercise this right.
○
If you choose
                to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which
                we many nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as:
a.
To defend
                against fraudulent activity directed towards our business, systems, or users.
b.
To detect and
                fix technical issues that affect existing system functions (e.g., for
                de-bugging).
c.
As necessary
                for the protection of the free speech or other rights of us (or others).
d.
To assist with
                law enforcement requests made pursuant to lawful process.
e.
For certain
                scientific or historical research purposes.
f.
For our own
                internal purposes, provided they are reasonably related to your relationship
                with us.
g.
To comply with
                our legal obligations.
○
Please note
                that we require certain information in order to provide our Site and Apps to
                you. If you ask us to delete that information, it may prevent you from being
                able to access or use our Site or Apps.
Right to Request Access to Your
                    Personal Information:
○
California (under the CCPA) and Virginia (under the VCDPA) give their residents 
                the right to request that we disclose both the categories and specific pieces of personal information 
                that we collect, use, or sell. Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah will give their residents these rights 
                also as those states’ data privacy laws become effective (the CPA and CTDPA on 7/1/2023 and the UCPA on 12/31/2023).  
                We will comply with such requests if we can verify them to a legally sufficient degree. You may make such an access 
                request by emailing us at
privacy@byzantineapps.io
with the
                subject line “CCPA Access Request” or by calling us toll-free at
+1-855-721-3550
.
○
We may be able to adequately verify access requests for certain information we have collected.  However, and in line with certain guidance provided by the California Attorney General, we do not provide location data in response to access requests due to the fact that we are not able to verify to a reasonably high degree of certainty that the location data we have collected pertains to the individual making such a request, or whether either an individual with custody of a device — or the person making the request — is the rightful owner of the device to which the information we hold pertains. For example, it is not uncommon for a person to be in possession of another person’s phone temporarily (for example, a partner, friend or work colleague’s mobile phone or tablet), whether or not such temporary possession is authorized. We take this approach in order to avoid a scenario where such a person in temporary possession of a phone might obtain potentially detailed and sensitive information pertaining to the phone’s owner through a request for access. We also believe California law compels us to avoid a scenario like this.  In addition, a recent study found that roughly 50% of mobile phones were not password protected at all, making the possibility of such “spoofing” a tangible risk.  Further, we do not have other, more conventional means to confirm the identity of a device’s true owner because for consumer privacy reasons we do not collect information such as name, address or email address that could be used to do so.
○
If you do not wish location data associated with your device to be used in the ways we describe above, we suggest that you make a request to opt out of sales of your information as detailed above. You can find complete information about how to exercise your right to opt out by visiting this link: Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights.
Our Collection of Sensitive Personal Information, and Your Rights to Limit Its Use:
○
Certain Personal Information that we collect and sell, such as precise geolocation of a person, household, or device, is considered “Sensitive Personal Information” under the data privacy laws of California (CCPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), and Virginia (VCDPA). We obtain the right to use and share this information, through the consent methods described in our Privacy Policy.  California residents have the right to require a business to limit the use of their Sensitive Personal Information to only certain internal business purposes specified in the CCPA.
○
To limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information, you may use either of the methods below:
●
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights.
●
By emailing your request to
privacy@byzantineapps.io
using a subject line that reads “California Limit SPI Use.”
How to Exercise Your Rights and
                    Submit a Verifiable Consumer Request:
○
To exercise
                your CCPA, CPA, CTDPA, UCPA, or VCDPA rights or learn more about how to do so, those residents may
                contact us using any of the following means:
a.
Sending an
                email to
privacy@byzantineapps.io
.
b.
With respect to
                access or deletion requests, by calling us toll-free at:
+1-855-721-3550
.
○
In certain
                circumstances, we may not disclose some personal information to you in response
                to an access request where doing so presents too great a risk to you or our
                business.  We may also withhold such information where we cannot verify your
                identity in connection to such personal information.
○
In the event we are not able to comply with your requests fully for any of the reasons described above, 
                we will still explain the reasons why we could not fulfill your request.  Certain consumers have the right 
                to appeal our decision not to fulfill a request, and may do so by emailing our Chief Privacy Officer at
appeals@byzantineapps.io
with the subject line “Privacy Choices Appeal.”
Right to Non-Discrimination:
○
If you elect to
                exercise your CCPA, CPA, CTDPA, UCPA, or VCDPA rights, we will not deny, charge different prices for, or
                provide a different level of quality of goods or services for that reason.
Information Regarding Individuals
                    Younger than 16 Years Old:
○
We do not
                knowingly collect personal information pertaining to minors younger than 16
                years old who reside in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia. In the event we learn that we have
                collected personal information regarding such California residents, we will
                take reasonable steps to remove such information from our database (or we will
                obtain any legally required consents).
Authorized Agents:
○

OUTLOGIC PRIVACY NOTICE
*Please click
HERE
to opt-out of selling your data.
OUTLOGIC LLC a Virginia company (“OUTLOGIC” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides data services to other companies and organizations, as further described in this privacy notice (“Privacy Notice.”).
This Privacy Notice explains how we collects, uses, stores, and shares personal information about individuals in two different contexts (we refer to such individuals as “you,” “your,” and “yourself”): (1) visitors to our website located at
www.outlogic.io
or (2) when we collect personal information from third parties such as mobile applications (“Apps”). This Privacy Notice also explains certain choices you may have regarding how we use this information about you, as well as rights you may have to access or correct the information we hold and use.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and would like to review your rights under the GDPR, please go to
Section 8
of this Privacy Notice. If you are a resident of California or Virginia or certain other states that have enacted privacy-specific consumer laws, you may review your data privacy rights under those types of state laws at
Section 10
of this Privacy Notice.
Please note that we do not use any precise location data to create or build consumer profiles or targeted audiences in connection with sensitive health based locations, nor do we permit our customers to do so. In addition, to further comply with specific state laws, we use commercially available information to assist in filtering out precise location data for sensitive health based locations in those states.
Below, we explain certain terms that we will use in this Notice that may make it easier to understand:
Advertising ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by operating system manufacturers to a Device. Examples of this include iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs.
Data Aggregators
: Third party data companies that provide data to Outlogic, including personal data and information.
Devices
: Internet-connected mobile devices such as Apple iPhones that use iOS or Samsung Galaxy devices that use Google’s Android OS.
IP Address
: a numeric address in a format that follows the Internet Protocol data rules and that is used to identify a computer, mobile phone, or other device connected to the internet.
Personal Information
: This Policy refers to “Personal Information” and “Personal Data” interchangeably, to mean the types of information/data that applicable laws that use those terms refer to. It includes, for instance, device identifiers, precise location data, name/address, email address, and other unique identifiers that can be associated with them.
Publishers:
Providers of Apps used by Users on Devices.
SDK, or Software Development Kit
: An SDK is a block of computer code that Publishers can integrate with their Apps to collect data, often useful (as in OUTLOGIC’s case) to the mobile advertising and data industries.
Services
: OUTLOGIC’s Services refer to the products and insights we create/provide using location data,
and using and providing IP Addresses
and/or Advertising IDs assigned by Device manufacturers, to companies for marketing and research purposes, for example, to enable their research and personalized advertising. The Services also refer to products and insights we provide using location data and/or Installation IDs assigned to Devices by certain Apps, to companies for research purposes, excluding marketing and personalized advertising. The Services also include the SDK and other similar technologies we may use to collect information.
Site
: Our website that you may visit at
http://www.outlogic.io/
.
Visitors
: Individuals who
visit our website or
choose to provide information directly to us via the OUTLOGIC website “Contact Us” form.
Server to Server App / Server to Server Partner
: OUTLOGIC sometimes partners with certain Publishers or other Data Aggregators, who (in each case) do not use the SDK in favor of sending us information they collect from their Apps using their own SDKs. In other cases, we may obtain the same kinds of information using server-to-server transfers instead of collecting information through SDKs.
System Location Services
: Device technologies that allow Apps to access information about your location (such as GPS coordinates).
Installation ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by certain Apps to a Device but which is not used for advertising purposes.
App Tracking Transparency/Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads
: Features on iOS or Android Devices that allow Users to disable, or limit Apps’ ability to access, the Device Advertising ID. On iOS phones, users who do not give Apps permission to track zeroes out the Advertising ID. On Android phones running Android 12 or newer, users whom Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads zeroes out the Advertising ID.
A. Summary: Who is OUTLOGIC?
OUTLOGIC is a platform for collecting, aggregating, licensing and managing data. In particular, we focus on the curation and use of high-quality location data to help provide insights to organizations of various kinds regarding patterns of peoples’ movements. Our platform assists a variety of businesses and organizations in understanding movement patterns and trends for purposes including marketing and advertising, financial research, market research, traffic and urban planning, smart cities, or educational purposes. Certain government entities or public health organizations may also use our platform, including for purposes of public health research and planning, information security, physical security, to prevent crime, or for civic and traffic planning. (Our specific data licensing practices may vary depending on geographic region).
2. What Types of Information Do We Collect?
A. Information We Collect Through Our Services
We collect information using our SDK. This information may include Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, location information (described more fully below), and other information pertaining to the way Devices and their users engage with mobile advertising services. We also collect the same types of information using Server to Server transfers. We also collect information (including location information) from Publishers to assist them in meeting revenue goals for their Apps, allowing them to provide media, games, and other mobile apps, such as weather or traffic apps, without charging their users. We also may collect and use information from Apps owned by OUTLOGIC affiliated companies.
Publishers can use our SDK with their Apps in order to enhance advertisers’ ability to show ads in Publisher Apps (including to target more relevant ads and to measure ad performance). App Publishers may also work with us to monetize their App content in other ways we describe in this Privacy Policy. (If you would like to opt-out of our use of the Advertising ID on your Device for these purposes, please take the steps explained in
Section 6
below, entitled “User Choices and Opt-Out Tools”).
When you use an App or OUTLOGIC App on your Device that has integrated with our Services (including the SDK), we can collect certain information through or about your Device, if you have granted access to (and you have not later opted-out of our use of) location services and an Advertising ID or Installation ID. In particular (but not exclusively):
Precise Location Information
:
Specific geolocation of the Device, usually described by latitude-longitude coordinates compiled through GPS features of our SDK, WiFi connection information, cell tower triangulation and other methods.
Dwell time within or in proximity to points of interest (i.e. the length of time your device stayed at one place).
Relative Location Information
:
Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) sensors, or beacons,
Information obtained from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Near-field Communication (NFC)
Our SDK is capable of receiving signals from each of the above technologies that indicate the proximity of a Device. For example, certain brick-and-mortar stores use beacons that sense when a Bluetooth-enabled Device is in proximity to the beacon (i.e., when a Device user enters the store). Retail locations, sports arenas, restaurants, museums and other similar businesses may also use beacons.
Advertising IDs or Installation IDs
Timestamps
(that may include time and date)
Device Event Information
:
App or system crashes
System crashes
Device settings
Device Usage Information
Type of device (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S21)
Operating system (OS) information (e.g., iOS 14.5)
System settings (e.g., enabled/disabled status for Location Services)
Time zone
Mobile carrier
IP address
Names and/or identifiers for Apps on your Device integrated with SDK
Network Information
VPN status
Network protocols employed
Device connectivity information (e.g., how a device connects to a network) and signal strength
Network information such as mobile network code and mobile country code

This information may include technical details about your computer or Device (such as the Device type, operating system, system settings and configurations, IP address, Advertising ID or other unique Device-based IDs, and mobile network carrier information) and information about how you use the Site (including details about the parts of the Site you access, traffic to and from other websites, timestamps, web log data, and other event information, including crashes and system activity). You may exercise control over this type of data collection by adjusting the settings on your device or browser (e.g., by disallowing cookies and using other similar settings).
Cookies:
We, along with our service providers and other vendors, may place cookies on our Visitors’ web browsers. You may view our full cookie policy
here
. We may use cookies for retargeting and other types of interest-based advertising, which you may limit by exercising the opt-out choices described in
Section 6
.
Web Beacons:
Web beacons or “pixels” are small, invisible webpage or email elements that may be used on the Site or in emails we send to you. We use them to deliver cookies, to count Site visits, to understand Site usage, to study the effectiveness of our advertising or marketing offers, and to learn whether you open an email or act upon it. You may limit this type of re-targeting and other types of interest-based advertising by exercising the opt-out choices explained in
Section 6
.
3. How We Use The Information We Collect Through Our Services
When we collect information through the Services, OUTLOGIC
or its customers who receive the data
may use it for any of the following purposes:
To Make Inferences based on collected data, including movement patterns and research
:
Movement Patterns
: To make inferences regarding the location and movement patterns of individuals or devices. For example, we might record location data from Devices at certain points of interest over time, like shows, sporting events, restaurants, etc., and we may include this information in the Services.
Data Products
: To use these location-based observations with other data products. For example, we may add other information to the location data we collect such as the name of a venue, time spent at a point of interest, or other information to a set of Advertising IDs or Installation IDs to enhance user profiles or to enable decision-making based on that information, such as executing a stock trade.
Advertising and Research
: For advertising and research purposes, such as use by advertising technology platforms who use the information to provide similar capabilities. The information helps these platforms to make predictions and generate insights about trends in consumer or market behavior, or to conduct scientific research in connection with human movement patterns.
Smart Cities and Security
: Real estate developers, urban planners, government entities, or security or smart city businesses may use and augment the information to tailor it to their needs. We also license the information to assist businesses and governments with planning, physical security, information security, and preventing crime.
Interest-Based Audiences and Targeting Ads
:
Interest-Based-Audiences
: We use the information we collect to organize Device users into audience segments based on their inferred interests (for example, that a Device user is interested in attending sporting events, or certain kinds of retail stores). This enables our Clients to deliver advertising to those users when they are recognized on their own platforms.
Targeting Ads
: By using audience segments, advertisers increase their chances of sending an ad that is more likely to be relevant.
Ad Measurement
:
Ad Measurement Analysis
: We use information we collect (such as location information and Advertising IDs) to assist advertisers with analyzing ad campaign performance – for example, by measuring how (or whether) Devices that were served with a particular ad engaged with the advertiser’s products or services. This is sometimes called ad measurement or attribution analysis.
An example of ad measurement analysis would be if certain Devices were served with an advertisement for “OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop” on Wednesday, and location data then showed traffic at OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop on Thursday or Friday was higher than average, OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop might conclude that its ad campaign performed well.
Publisher Analysis
:
Analysis and Compliance
: We assist our Publisher partners with analyzing how Users engage with the Publishers’ Apps, and in activating that information for advertising, to generate revenue, and to enhance App functionality.
We may also use this information to provide Publishers with options for complying with certain laws, regulations, and other rules where applicable.
To learn more about how we collect, use and share information pertaining to our Site visitors, please refer to
Section 5
.
4. How Do We Use Information We Collect From Visitors?
We may use information we collect about Visitors for our corporate and internal purposes, including:
Analyzing what products and services Visitors may be interested in, the popularity of different pages of our Site, as well as how Visitors interact with our Site in other ways. If you give your personal contact information to us (e.g., your email address), we may combine that information with other information described in
Section 2
to understand how to better serve you.
To communicate with Visitors, including to offer customer or Visitor support for the Site or the Services. For example, we may use your personal information solely for purposes of replying to your questions when you use the “Contact Us” form on the Site.
Market research.
Direct and online targeted marketing in accordance with applicable law. For instance, we may “retarget” ads about our services to those who have visited our website.
To improve, maintain, operate, and personalize the Site.
For human resource purposes.
For any other legitimate purpose upon proper notice and/or consent.
5. With Whom Do We Share Information We Collect?
We share the information we collect for purposes of operating our platform (for example, with our service providers) and for purposes of supporting the business of our customers. We may share information we collect from your Device as follows:
With Our Customers
:
We share Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, Location Information, App Usage Data, and audience segments generated from those data points, with our customers (“Clients”).
Our Clients may include brand advertisers, data and technology platforms, advertising technology companies, and other organizations that study consumer behavior, provide tailored advertising, or study human movement patterns.
Like OUTLOGIC, some of these Clients may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options that the NAI offers (and requires its members to provide), please
see
https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. OUTLOGIC is not responsible for these Clients’ or any third parties’ privacy policies or opt-out programs or their compliance with NAI requirements.
With Our Service Providers
:
We have contracts with businesses that assist us with our own business operations (e.g., our Site, database hosting, fraud detection and prevention, verification and reporting, data hygiene, human resources, marketing and advertising, and email services), as well as billing or accounting functions, collections, technology, and other forms of operational support.
With Our Affiliates
:
In the event we establish a subsidiary or otherwise become affiliated with another company, we may share any information that we have collected with those entities.
In Relation to Legal Proceedings or Process
:
We may share information we have collected when we have a legal obligation to do so. This may include compliance with a binding court order, exercising, establishing or defending OUTLOGIC’s legal rights, or those of Clients or any other third party, or in good faith to comply with the requirements of any applicable law or legal process.
Similarly, we may disclose any information we have collected as required to respond in good faith to legal process, including subpoenas (whether civil or criminal), court orders or search warrants.
To Investigate Malfeasance and to Defend Ourselves or Third Parties
:
We may share information to assist us in enforcing our legal rights, our Terms of Service, or other policies as applicable, or to investigate any potential violation of the same. We may also share information to investigate any potential violations of the law, to defend or protect ourselves, our Clients, or any third party from any potential harm (whether tangible or intangible).
In Relation to a Corporate Transaction
:
If a third party seeks to acquire or actually acquires our business or assets in whole or in part, we may disclose information we have collected in connection to that transaction (including without limitation during due diligence that may be undertaken in advance of possible sales).
6. User Choices & Opt-Out Tools
You can manage the way that we use data collected passively from your Device in connection with the OUTLOGIC Site and the Services (e.g. Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, or cookies) as described below:
Browser Settings
: You may adjust the privacy and security settings of your web browser to change how your browser uses cookies.
Opting Out of Interest Based Advertising on Mobile Devices
: You can opt out of tailored advertising on mobile devices by companies that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting the NAI’s Mobile Choices Page and following the instructions provided there.
You can opt out of interest-based advertising on your browser by participating companies by visiting the
NAI’s opt-out page
or the
DAA’s Consumer Choice Page
. Residents of the EEA, UK and Switzerland may refer to
www.youronlinechoices.com
. The opt-out tools provided on these industry pages are generally based on cookie technologies. As such, if you delete your cookies (or change or update your web browser) you will need to repeat the opt out process. While our Services are generally not based on cookie technology, we are providing this information because we may partner with businesses to tailor ads for our own Services that do (for example, to retarget Visitors of Sites with advertisements). Further, certain third-party platforms may use information we have collected to match identifiers across devices – such as to tie a mobile Advertising ID by common IP Address to a browser-based cookie ID.
OUTLOGIC Opt-out:
You may limit the ways we use certain information we have collected by submitting an opt-out request by visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
here
.
Our Marketing Emails:
If you receive marketing or promotional emails from us, you may opt out of receiving those messages by following the “unsubscribe” instructions contained in them, or by emailing us with your request at
privacy@outlogic.io
. If you opt out of our marketing and promotional messages, you may still receive transaction- or service-related emails about your business relationship with us.
7. Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect our physical infrastructure as well as in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks. These measures are intended to protect our systems (and the information contained therein) from loss, misappropriation, misuse, alteration or disclosure. No method of electronic transmission or storage is perfectly secure, however, so we cannot guarantee the security of information we collect with absolute certainty.

We (and those using our Services) are required to provide certain information about the processing of “Personal Data” of users in EEA and Switzerland under the GDPR of users in the UK under the UK GDPR. For purposes of this explanation, we will refer to both as “GDPR.” “Personal Data” generally refers to data that identifies or is capable of identifying a particular user or Device. Names and addresses, cookie IDs, Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, precise location information, and biometric data are examples of “Personal Data.”
If you have any questions about OUTLOGIC’s processing of Personal Data in the context of the GDPR, You may contact our Chief Privacy Officer by emailing your questions to
privacy@outlogic.io
, or contact our EU Representative at
eurep@outlogic.io
.
The representations and information we provide below, which are applicable only to individuals located in the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, are provided for purposes of compliance with the GDPR. Please do not rely on the information below if you are not located in one of those regions.
Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data:
Under the GDPR, we must disclose the legal bases we rely on to process Personal Data. Our legal bases for processing Personal Data for the purposes we describe in
Section 2
and
Section 3
above and
Section 5
as to our corporate data) include:
Consent
. We rely on your consent to provide our Services that use precise location information related to other Personal Data. We also rely on your consent to store and access information on your Device (e.g., Advertising IDs and Installation IDs). Our reliance on consent is in turn often in reliance on compliance steps required of and taken by our data suppliers and by Clients that use the Services. These steps are intended to confirm that your consent is collected in compliance with the GDPR and passed on to Clients and business partners such that we only facilitate the collection of data in compliance with the law. We may rely on your consent to process Personal Data in other circumstances as well. When we do so, we will follow applicable laws pertaining to providing and withdrawing consent. We also attempt to obtain consent for certain of our clients to process Personal Data. These Clients, in turn, may be independent data controllers as to data in their own possession and control.
Legitimate interest
. We may rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data in some cases. We may do so when we use Personal Data for purposes of maintaining the security of our services (including to detect and prevent fraud or to facilitate the detection and correction of bugs or other errors). We also rely on legitimate interest when we use our own Clients’ Personal Data (or our Site Visitors’ Personal Data) to communicate with them about their use of our Services, or to analyze user activity on our Site.
Contractual Agreements
. In some cases our basis for processing Personal Data is that the processing is necessary pursuant to a contractual relationship we have entered into (such as records and contact information related to our Clients).
You may obtain a copy of our SCCs document by contacting us at
privacy@outlogic.io
.
Legal Obligations
. We may process Personal Data when it is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
Transfers of Personal Data:
When we collect Personal Data in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, and then transfer it outside of those jurisdictions, we take measures to ensure that such Personal Data is protected by appropriate safeguards. In general, our transfers of Personal Data rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements to safeguard that data where the GDPR or other European data protection laws require it. You may use the contact information below to request a copy of these SCCs.
How We Retain Personal Data
: We generally retain Personal Data we collect for as long as is necessary to either (1) provide our Services (absent a deletion or opt-out request); or (2) for other purposes including compliance with our legal obligations, dispute resolution, and to enforce our contracts. Our schedule for retaining Advertising IDs, Installation IDs,
and related location data
is as follows: Advertising IDs and Installation IDs we collect in order to provide our Services are rendered inactive by us within 12 months after the time we last obtained your consent; however, we may retain data beyond 13 months where we have de-identified it (i.e., altered it in such a way that it cannot be linked to Personal Data). We may retain this (and other) information insofar as we have a legal or operational need to do so, for example, for purposes of auditing, corporate record-keeping, legal compliance, accounting, security and bug-prevention purposes.
Rights of Data Subjects:
Data Subjects have certain rights in connection with the Personal Data that data controllers process about them pursuant to the GDPR. These include the right to access Personal Data, the right to request correction of inaccurate Personal Data, the right to request the restriction of processing of Personal Data, the right to request deletion of Personal Data, and the right to object to processing of Personal Data (including when we process Personal Data to build a profile for targeted digital advertising). We describe these rights more fully below.
Right to Access
: You may contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
in order to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller. We will respond to your request by explaining the steps you must follow to access your Personal Data after we receive your request. Because we are required to verify the identity of the individual making a request before we provide access to Personal Data, we will evaluate requests to exercise certain rights to access Personal Data on a case-by-case basis. In conducting this evaluation, we may consider both (1) the effort involved in verifying whether Personal Data that we process actually pertains to the data subject making the request – and only to that data subject; and (2) any potentially negative consequences that may result from erroneously releasing Personal Data to an individual other than the data subject, in light of the sensitivity of the Personal Data at issue and the degree of certainty we can achieve through verification. We may also limit the amount or kind of Personal Data we will release in circumstances where we believe it is likely that the improper release of Personal Data would adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject. We will only honor requests for access to Personal Data for which we act as a data controller, as explained more fully in sub-section (d) below. Where we act as a processor for Personal Data on behalf of another entity (for example, our Clients), you may contact that company instead of OUTLOGIC to make a data access request.
Right to Correct
: You may exercise your right to correct Personal Data by contacting us using the contact information provided below.
Right to Withdraw your Consent or Object to our Personal Data Processing
: You may use the opt-out methods described in
Section 6
of this Privacy Notice to withdraw your consent for our processing of your Personal Data (when we are relying on your consent). If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your Personal Data in connection with our Services within 30 days or fewer.
Right to Request Deletion
: You have the right to request that we delete Personal Data concerning you that we process as a controller. If you use the opt-out process described above, we will also delete your Personal Data. You may also contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
to request that we delete your Personal Data. We will provide further instructions on how you can exercise your right to deletion after we receive your email request. In certain circumstances we may keep copies of Personal Data in back-up files (or otherwise in inactive form), for certain of our internal purposes that are important to our business, including legal, auditing, accounting and billing, bug-detection and correction. We may keep such backups for as long as is necessary to fulfill those purposes.
Right to Make Complaints
: You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our processing of Personal Data with a relevant data protection authority. If you have a complaint, please contact us first to allow us to assist you in resolving it.
OUTLOGIC may act as either a data controller or a data processor in connection with the Personal Data we process, depending on the circumstances. EU data protection law distinguishes between companies that process Personal Data for their own purposes (i.e. “data controllers”) and companies that process Personal Data on behalf of and at the direction of other organizations (i.e. “data processors”). When we act as a data processor for other organizations, such as for our Clients, we may direct your requests or inquiries to the relevant data controller that is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data.
9. Children’s Data
We do not intend for our Services to be used in connection with minors under the age of 18, and we do not intentionally collect data from them. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected of any such data, please use the contact information provided in
Section 12
below to let us know.
10. Additional Information for U.S. Residents Including Residents of California, Montana, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and other States with Applicable Privacy Rights
US residents have data deletion rights as described in this
Section 10
. In addition, California residents have certain privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”), and Virginia residents have similar privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act of 2019 (“VCDPA”), with respect to personal information or personal data about them. Residents of Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have similar rights under either the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA” effective July 1, 2023), the
Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring
(“CTDPA” effective July 1, 2023), or the Utah
Consumer Privacy Act
(“UCPA” effective December 31, 2023).
A number of other states’ residents have or will have similar protections at various times beginning in 2024 and 2025. We refer in this section to all states with privacy laws relevant to the below rights and disclosures as “Applicable States”).
A useful guide map to consult as to what privacy laws exist in your state is located at
http://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/
. (we are not responsible for the content in that tracker, which is not ours but rather is provided by a third-party organization.)
Under the CCPA “Personal Information” generally means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Similarly, under the VCDPA
and other state privacy laws
, “Personal Data” means any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. When we use the term “personal information” in the following sections, we mean your personal data or information under the CCPA if you are a California resident or your Personal Data under the
under the laws of other Applicable States
.
If you are a resident of the US including any of
the Applicable States
, this section of the Privacy Notice applies to you insofar as we have collected personal information about you, or have sold such information.
As required by the CCPA and VCDPA, and the other Applicable States laws when they become effective, describe the personal information we collect about residents of US states, and the purposes for which we may use it, in the following sections:

Create “identity” graphs to assist our Clients in finding users across multiple channels. This may include linking personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (eg, Advertising ID, Installation ID, IP address).
Research for Marketing and Other Purposes
:
We provide information for purposes including financial and market research, for the study movement patterns, for urban planning, for smart cities research, or for educational purposes. We may also share information with government entities or public health organizations who wish to study movement patterns for disease prevention research, for physical security or defense purposes or information security, to prevent crime, or for civic, disaster and traffic planning.
To Operate Our Services
: We use personal information to:
Enhance, test, update, and verify our own data and data-related services
Develop new products or services
Operate, analyze, enhance, and secure our services
Other Internal Business Purposes
:
We use personal information for internal research or operations, auditing, detecting and responding to security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance. Information we collect from our Sites and from Apps may be used for the above, in addition to our own marketing purposes.
Sharing for Purposes of Legal Compliance:
We may share personal information with third parties for purposes of: (1) compliance with official legal process or a regulatory investigation (for example, a valid subpoena or court order); (2) enforcing our Terms of Service, this Privacy Notice, or other agreements, including investigation of suspected violations of the same; (3) responding to claims that certain content violates the rights of third parties; or (4) protecting the rights, property or personal safety of us (or our platform), our Clients, our affiliates, our agents, our platform users, or the general public. Similarly, we may share personal information with other entities to detect or prevent fraud, to prevent spam or malware, or other similar purposes.
Sharing In Connection With a Corporate Transaction:
In the event of a major corporate transaction (such as a merger, investment, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, or sale of some or all of our assets), we may share personal information in connection with that transaction, including for purposes of associated due diligence.
Sharing With Our Service Providers:
We may share any personal information we collect with our service providers. Our service providers may include, for example, providers of: technology; support for our Clients; business operations; web or database hosting; billing; accounting; physical or information security; marketing and advertising; data management, validation, enhancement or hygiene; or providers that otherwise assist us with providing, developing, maintaining, or improving our Services.
Aggregate Information:
We may use personal information to create aggregate information, or may de-identify any personal information we collect to make it such that it cannot be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate or De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate or De-Identified Information for any purpose, including, but not limited to, for research and marketing purposes. We may also share Aggregate or De-Identified Information with third parties, who may include advertisers or marketers, promotional partners, our sponsors, or otherwise at our discretion.
C. Rights and Choices of US States Residents
If you are a resident of any US state, you have the right to request that we delete personal information collected from you, including data that may reveal your mobile device’s precise geographic location, and also send requests to any recipients of your personal information that they delete such data from their commercial databases (your “deletion rights”). If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we may nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as to prevent, detect, or investigate data security incidents, or to protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity directed at the company. The right to delete is separate from the right to opt-out of data sales as provided in Applicable States laws. We describe below how you may exercise your deletion rights.
In addition to data deletion, if you are a resident of an Applicable State, you may have
additional rights including
the right to request (1) that we disclose what personal information we collect from you; and (2) to opt out of our sale of your personal information. The states that provide these rights to their residents include but are not limited to California (under the CCPA), Colorado (under the CPA), Connecticut (under the CTDPA), Utah (under the UCPA), and Virginia (under the VCDPA),
as well as other Applicable States, as we have stated above.
These rights are subject to certain limitations, although you will not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. In certain circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee to process your request to the extent permitted by law.
Right to Opt-out of the Sale of Your Personal Information
:
Residents
of Applicable States
may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. “Sale” is defined broadly by
various state laws,
to include making personal information available in exchange for any monetary or other valuable consideration.
To “opt out” of our “sale” of your personal information you may use either of the methods below:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
By emailing your opt-out request to
privacy@outlogic.io
using a subject line that reads “Data Transfer Opt out.”
Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
:
If we have collected personal information from you, you may request that we delete such personal information. A request to delete is distinct from a request to “opt out” of our sale of your personal information. You may contact us by email at
privacy@outlogic.io
or call us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602 to exercise this right.
If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we many nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as:
To defend against fraudulent activity directed towards our business, systems, or users.
To detect and fix technical issues that affect existing system functions (e.g., for de-bugging).
As necessary for the protection of the free speech or other rights of us (or others).
To assist with law enforcement requests made pursuant to lawful process.
For certain scientific or historical research purposes.
For our own internal purposes, provided they are reasonably related to your relationship with us.
To comply with our legal obligations.
Please note that we require certain information in order to provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete that information, it may prevent you from being able to access or use our Services.
Opt-Out/Access/Deletion Requests Metrics-2024
From January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, we maintained processes to facilitate requests pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act. We received the following requests, and responded as follows:a. As to requests to know:
We received 10
We complied with 2
We denied 8, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
b. As to requests to delete:
We received 141
We complied with 8
We denied 133, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
c. As to requests to opt out of sale:
We received 543
We complied with 94
We denied 449, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
d. We received an additional 24,800 requests by a purported third-party automated data deletion service. Such requests could not be processed, due to service’s failure to provide the necessary identifying information despite our repeated requests.
Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information
:
Applicable States may give their residents the right to request that we disclose both the categories and specific pieces of personal information that we collect, use, or sell. We will comply with data access requests if we can verify them to a legally sufficient degree. You may make such an access request by emailing us at
privacy@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Data Access Request” or by calling us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602.
We may be able to adequately verify access requests for certain information we have collected. However, in line with certain guidance provided by the California Attorney General, we do not provide location data in response to access requests due to the fact that we are not able to verify to a reasonably high degree of certainty that the location data we have collected pertains to the individual making such a request, or whether either an individual with custody of a device — or the person making the request — is the rightful owner of the device to which the information we hold pertains. For example, it is not uncommon for a person to be in possession of another person’s phone temporarily (for example, a partner, friend or work colleague’s mobile phone or tablet), whether or not such temporary possession is authorized. We take this approach in order to avoid a scenario where such a person in temporary possession of a phone might obtain potentially detailed and sensitive information pertaining to the phone’s owner through a request for access. We also believe California law compels us to avoid a scenario like this. In addition, a recent study found that roughly 50% of mobile phones were not password protected at all, making the possibility of such “spoofing” a tangible risk. Further, we do not have other, more conventional means to confirm the identity of a device’s true owner because for consumer privacy reasons we do not collect information such as name, address or email address that could be used to do so.
If you do not wish location data associated with your device to be used in the ways we describe above, we suggest that you make a request to opt out of sales of your information as detailed above. You can find complete information about how to exercise your right to opt out by visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
Our Collection of Sensitive Personal Information, and Your Rights to Limit Its Use
:
Certain Personal Information that we collect and sell, such as precise geolocation of a person, household, or device, is considered “Sensitive Personal Information” under the data privacy laws of California (CCPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), and Virginia (VCDPA)
and other Applicable States
. We obtain the right to use and share this information, through the consent methods described in our Privacy Policy. California residents have the right to require a business to limit the use of their Sensitive Personal Information to only certain internal business purposes specified in the CCPA.
To limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information, you may use either of the methods below:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
Use OUTLOGIC’s web-form available
here
.
By emailing your request to
privacy@outlogic.io
using a subject line that reads “California Limit SPI Use.”
How to Exercise Your Rights and Submit a Verifiable Consumer Request
:
To exercise
applicable privacy
rights or to learn more about how to do so, residents of those
Applicable
States may contact us using any of the following means:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
By emailing your request to
privacy@outlogic.io
.
With respect to access or deletion requests, by calling us toll-free at: +1 (866) 346-9602.
In certain circumstances, we may not disclose some personal information to you in response to an access request where doing so presents too great a risk to you or our business. We may also withhold such information where we cannot verify your identity in connection to such personal information.
To learn about how to opt out of Tailored Advertising, please review and consider whether to use the industry opt-out mechanisms provided on the
NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) page
. We believe that opting out using these industry tools may be more efficient, faster, and more uniform compared to using manual opt out processes.
In the event we are not able to comply with your requests fully for any of the reasons described above, we will still explain the reasons why we could not fulfill your request. Certain consumers have the right to appeal our decision not to fulfill a request, and may do so by emailing our Chief Privacy Officer at
A
ppeals@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Privacy Choices Appeal”.
Right to Non-Discrimination
:
If you elect to exercise your rights
under the Applicable State, as described in this
Section 10
, we will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services for that reason.
Information Regarding Individuals Younger than 16 Years Old
:
Unless we have obtained legally sufficient consent to do so, we do not knowingly sell personal information pertaining to minors younger than 16 years old. In the event we learn that we have collected or sold personal information regarding such residents, we will take reasonable steps to remove such information from our database (or we will obtain any legally required consents).
Authorized Agents
:
You may exercise your rights described above under the
laws of Applicable States
, by designating an agent to make requests on your behalf. If you choose to designate an agent, we will take steps to verify both (1) your identity; and (2) that your designated agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf by providing us
(depending on the legal requirement in your state)
with a written authorization signed by you or a copy of a valid power of attorney.
D. Retention of U.S. Personal Information
We retain personal information pertaining to the categories listed in
Section 10
.A. on the following schedule: device and other identifiers, precise location data, inferences, and internet or other electronic activity information may be retained for up to 5 years, with certain aggregated information related to locations of devices and internal reporting data retained for up to 3 years, to fulfill the business purposes listed in Section II.B. We may maintain personal information for longer periods if we have a significant operational or legal need to do so, such as for auditing, compliance, accounting, security, bug-prevention purposes, and when required by law. For example, we may retain Consent audit logs
for up to 10 years
.

Sub-policy 1
https://tacs.c0nnectthed0ts.com/policy1/data_privacy.html:
Thank you for installing our app.
Data Privacy Policy
The umlaut insightCoreSDK is provided by umlaut communications GmbH, Am Kraftversorgungsturm 3, 52070 Aachen, Germany (“umlaut communications”). Any use of the corresponding host application, where the umlaut insightCoreSDK is part of, is only allowed under the conditions as outlined below.
Declaration of Consent to Data Processing
By downloading and using a host application, which is enabled by the umlaut insightCoreSDK, you are consenting to the data processing as described in this Data Privacy Policy.
With using the umlaut insightCoreSDK, we collect personal-related (pseudonymous) data. This is information that is not directly associated with the real-life identity of the user, for example, the type of internet connection, the measured velocity and location and measurements from connectivity tests, as well as system and usage parameters, and, provide those anonymized to our partners. In NO case do we collect content information such as messages or passwords.
Data Privacy – What we stand for
umlaut communications are aware that you consider a particularly safe handling of all your personal data as extremely important. Therefore, we guarantee that all your data is processed by us in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU legislation, as implemented in Germany.
What information is collected
The umlaut insightCoreSDK collects personal-related (pseudonymous) data. This is information that is not directly associated with the real-life identity of the user (and which could not be used to identify them individually), for example, the type of internet connection, the measured velocity and location and measurements from connectivity tests, as well as system and usage parameters.
At the latest after six months, the pseudonym is automatically replaced by a new random number. Information collected will at NO time be associated with names, email addresses or phone numbers of users. In NO case do we collect content information such as messages or passwords.
In addition to the results of the tests run by the SDK other localization information and technical (system) parameters are obtained. Some technical parameters (such as wireless network information) are collected periodically, e.g. subject to GPS localization events.
As far as IP-addresses are concerned, those will be masked on collection within the app, by removing the last three digits; therefore, a correlation to a single user is no longer possible.
Specifically, the following data will be collected from the user’s device and analyzed:
Measurement results as executed by the umlaut insightCoreSDK (active measurements “Connection Test”)
Internet availability / success ratio
Download time
Latency (“ping”)
Measurement data collected through use of the device (passive measurements)
Download speed
Upload speed
Dropped calls
Wireless access technology
Coverage / signal strength
System and usage parameters
User ID (pseudonymous random number)
Wireless network information (e. g. network operator, Cell ID, signal strength, SSID)
Device information (e. g. model, operating system)
Location information (e. g. longitude / latitude)
Usage information (e. g. transferred amount of data, call logs)
App usage (e. g. of all installed apps, their usage time, duration, volume and location)
Time information (e. g. time stamps of the measurements)
Other system information (e. g. battery status, memory usage, connected devices)
Release information (e. g. app build, data formats)
The regular execution of the connection test and the collection of the passive measurements and system and usage information take place in the background. The connection test is regularly checking the availability of a data network connectivity to the internet and, thereby, it consumes less than 3MB in total per month.
Purpose of Data Collection
The data collected is used statistically, with the purposes of supporting the development and improvement of communication networks as well as usage-related analyses.
Transfer of Information
With acceptance of the Data Privacy Policy, you agree that the information described above, is stored and can be transferred anonymously to our partners.

Privacy Policy - Apps & Connectivity Assistant
This Privacy Policy applies to use of the Opensignal (“
Opensignal
,” “
we
,” “
us
,” or “
our
”) mobile application and data we collect through, mobile applications operated by one of our partners (each, a “Partner”) who has implemented our Software Development Kit, or “
SDK
.”
The purpose of this Policy is to inform you about our privacy practices and to ensure that you understand the purposes for which we collect and process personal data, how we look after your personal data, and inform you of your privacy rights.
1. WHO WE ARE
Opensignal works with the global telecom ecosystem to help it understand and improve network speeds and network coverage for consumers like you. We provide application performance analytics and connectivity insights to our Partners while helping companies optimize networks in the areas that need it most. Opensignal takes great pride in providing a service that benefits many as we work toward our vision of advancing connectivity for all.
When you opt-in to allowing Opensignal to collect network performance readings from your device, we work with our Partners and companies in the telecom ecosystem to provide you with a better network and application experience. We rely on your choice and consent to initiate any transfer of data (and you can withdraw consent and opt-out at any time through the application). Our mobile application Partners support us entering into this relationship with you by facilitating our disclosure and consent process. We do not collect anything that directly identifies you or your mobile handset. We aggregate or depersonalize all data prior to sharing with our customers.
This Privacy Policy describes how we, Opensignal, collect, use, and share the data that you consent for us to collect, including personal data, when you opt in to allow us access to data in connection with the network performance experienced through a mobile application operated by one of our Partners.
As a company whose livelihood depends on data and its proper treatment, Opensignal takes data privacy and security very seriously. As such we have taken steps to go well beyond basic privacy and data protection requirements.
We request your consent to collect information relating to the network performance your device experiences, which may include certain types of personal data described below, in order to measure the performance, availability and/or signal quality of communication networks (the “
Opensignal Services
”).
Opensignal is the controller or joint controller and, as applicable, is responsible for the collection, control and processing of personal data that we collect from your device. If you have any questions or concerns about Opensignal’s use of your personal data, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.
IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF COLORADO, CONNECTICUT, OR VIRGINIA, PLEASE SEE YOUR DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS IN SECTION 9. IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT, PLEASE SEE THE CCPA SUPPLEMENT BELOW IN SECTION 10. IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF NEVADA, PLEASE SEE YOUR NEVADA PRIVACY RIGHTS IN SECTION 11.
2. MOBILE APPLICATIONS
At Opensignal, we use mobile network experience measurements to publish independent reports and insights on the real-world mobile network experience of everyday users worldwide. We obtain the relevant data by collecting measurements relating to signal reception and quality from mobile devices. The Opensignal mobile application and our Partner’s mobile applications (each, a “Mobile Application”) enable us to request your consent to our data collection. If you consent to initiate our collection of data, we may collect data from your mobile device when you are using a Mobile Application and/or when it is running in the background pertaining to network and wireless device experience.
WHAT DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT AND USE THAT DATA
The different kinds of personal data we may collect includes location data, device data and usage data as described further below.
The purpose of collecting limited device data is to measure the experience that devices have on wireless networks. If consent has been granted, we take measurements from devices from time to time including location data (which include GPS coordinates or similar information regarding the location of a network reading taken from your device), network type, network operator, cellular and Wifi signal strength and quality, IP address, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and Wifi routers (including both BSSID and SSID). Location readings are not tied to a device identifier such as a mobile handset MAC or IMEI, which we do not collect, and are instead the locations of network experience readings for purposes such as building general heatmaps of good and poor performance. We measure the performance of the data connection including the speed, responsiveness and reliability along with the total amount of data transferred. We collect crash logs data and diagnostics to ensure that our software does not negatively impact consumer experiences.
We collect information from environmental sensors on devices (depending on which ones are integrated in the device), which allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the external atmospheric pressure and light intensity. We also measure some internal device conditions – such as battery temperature and voltage. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how instantaneous device conditions may affect the experience of wireless networks. To better understand differences between devices, we collect data on device hardware such as the model, manufacturer, and manufacturers and models of sub-components (such as the cellular radio) and the capabilities of these components (for example the number of cores on the CPU). Similarly, to understand differences caused by software, we collect information on the mobile platform version used and whether custom ROMs or Android skins are installed, as well as the operating system. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how device properties affect the experience of wireless networks.
When a Mobile Application containing our SDK is installed and consent is provided, an identification code (“Resettable ID”) is randomly generated by our software and allocated to that installation instance rather than the device when we take measurements. A different and unique Resettable ID will be generated by each Mobile Application on a particular device. New installations of the same Mobile Application will also generate new unique Resettable IDs. Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, specific to Opensignal, and not shared externally. To further help us manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, as these may indicate which telecom carrier network is being accessed and is impacting your experience. This document does not encompass or detail Opensignal's handling of internal employee or customer data. Opensignal's employees and customers may provide personal information through the regular course of business and Opensignal separately handles the governance of that data.
We prevent user identification; we do not collect name, email address, phone number, social media ID, contact list, Mobile Advertising ID, mobile handset MAC/IMEI, or anything else which directly identifies an individual or their specific device. For the avoidance of doubt, we also do not collect any special categories of personal data about you as defined in GDPR. We aggregate or depersonalize all data prior to sharing with our customers.
THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE YOUR DATA
The purposes for which we collect, store, and then aggregate or depersonalize personal data for external use are the following:
We do not use the measurements we take from mobile devices for any individualized user identification or individualized user tracking. Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to measure the performance of a carrier and the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time. For example, we use data to improve wireless networks, research market performance, identify aggregate trends in device and network utilization patterns, understand the network-based drivers of subscriber churn and acquisition, and design effective network performance communication campaigns. Furthermore, we use data for the purpose of providing aggregated telecommunications network flow share, market share and other market analysis, using proprietary algorithms generating observations of market behavior, activations and deactivations across the telecom infrastructure. We publish some of the aggregated or depersonalized statistical data that we generate and we provide it to our customers (such as network operators) to help them understand, communicate and optimize their own network’s service coverage, performance and signal quality (and those of their competitors). We also create aggregated or depersonalized information.
We use data to test, monitor, improve or upgrade the Mobile Applications or SDKs, to meet our legal obligations and the regulatory requirements to which we may be subject, for loss prevention purposes and to protect and enforce our rights and meet our obligations to third parties, and for our internal business purposes, such as compiling and analyzing usage information for general operational, statistical and business purposes.
Our Customers and Partners are not permitted to use our data to identify the mobile applications or publishers that our data has been received from. We collect data from various mobile applications, and our reports, data, and documentation do not reveal which mobile applications the source data was collected from. We do not publicly disclose our Partners without their permission.
3. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR DATA
We collect and process personal data based on your express consent. If consent is provided, it can be withdrawn via measures provided by the Mobile Application, such as through the personal settings menu in the Mobile Application (but that will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent). In respect of any personal data collected from devices with your consent we also rely on our legitimate interest in conducting our business and in carrying out statistical and scientific research work and in providing analytical data to our clients and improving global connectivity for users like you.
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
Opensignal participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Opensignal’s identification number within the framework is 1263.
4. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION
Service Providers. We may share datasets containing personal data as part of private contracts we have with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with the Opensignal Services, such as cloud service providers for storage and the processing required for depersonalization. Where this information is shared with such third parties, we obligate the third-party service provider to manage the information only on our behalf and solely for our benefit (and not for its own benefit).
Business Change. If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer databases containing personal data to successor party or parties in connection with such transaction or change in ownership or legal structure.
Necessary Disclosure. Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Opensignal Services; (ii) comply with laws, subpoenas, warrants, court orders, legal processes or requests of government or law enforcement officials; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety or property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding known or suspected illegal activities; fraud; our rights, reputation, safety or property, or those of our users or others; violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements; or as otherwise required by law.
Subsidiaries and affiliates. We may share the data that we collect from users’ mobile devices with the Opensignal subsidiaries and affiliates, with the purpose of bringing together complementary data on consumer experience, network performance, and subscriber behavior.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
5. HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take appropriate measures to protect personal data collected through the Opensignal Services against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, destruction or modification. These include physical, technological, contractual, and administrative measures.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, accurate, complete, or current. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.
6. HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION
Any personal data which may be contained in the sets of measurements of mobile network signal performance described above is only retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of personal data, the purposes for which we process personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
7. COUNTRY OF PROCESSING
We operate globally. The collection of data from devices takes place in the country where the device is used. We store and otherwise process data (including personal data) through third party cloud service providers who offer a range of global storage location options. We store personal data records predominantly through third-party cloud service providers on servers located in the United States of America. When transferring personal data records to a country which does not provide an adequate level of protection to privacy rights, we put in place appropriate safeguards including data transfer agreements.
8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
The Opensignal Service is not directed to children and is intended for use by adults only. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal data from individuals under 18 years of age. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any information through the Opensignal Service and do not provide your consent for the use of your data.
9. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
Data subjects may have the following legal rights depending on applicable law in respect of their personal data that we process:
The right to require Opensignal to confirm whether or not your information is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which your information is to be stored and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to your information;
The right to require access to the personal data and to require Opensignal to rectify inaccurate information;
Where Opensignal has relied on the ‘consent’ basis for processing that information, the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This right to withdraw consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
The right to request the erasure of their information. You can make a request for erasure where:
the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;
where the processing of the information is based on your consent (and the other circumstances described in the ‘Legal Basis for Processing Your Data’ and ‘How We Share Personal Information’ sections above no longer apply), if you withdraw your consent; or
where the personal data is processed by Opensignal solely on the basis of our ‘legitimate interest’, if you withdraw your consent for the processing of your data and you object to the processing of your personal data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing (such as, for example, the achievement of the purpose of using your data for statistical or scientific research purposes or where the processing of the data is required to meet statutory obligations or for the defense of legal claims).
Where Opensignal has disclosed your information of a data subject to a third party and you request the erasure or rectification of the data, Opensignal will take any steps required under relevant laws to inform the third party of such request.
The right to require Opensignal to restrict its processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that data is disputed or an objection has been raised. In such circumstances, Opensignal will only process that information with your express consent, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest;
Where data is processed based on your consent or to fulfill a contractual obligation provided for by law, you have the right to receive your personal data from Opensignal in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
The right to object to the processing of personal data where:
a.Opensignal relies solely on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that data, in which case we will be legally required to stop processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your privacy rights and interests; or
b.the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will immediately stop processing your information for such purposes.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (www.ico.org.uk) or in some cases with the data protection supervisory authority or regulator of the jurisdiction where you reside. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the authority or regulator, so please contact us in the first instance.
You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organization, or to you, in certain circumstances.
The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment. In addition, there are, consistent with relevant laws, limitations on our ability to honor requests to exercise these rights for data that cannot be linked to a verified request, such as where data has been de-personalized.
To exercise these rights, please call us at (+44) 020 3289 3375 or email us at

We will aim to respond to any request within one month. Please note that we cannot fulfill requests to know the specific pieces of personal information that we may have collected about you. In order to disclose the specific pieces of personal information that we may have collected about you, we would have to verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty. Given the limited amount of information that we collect about you, we do not maintain enough data points to verify your identity to the reasonably high degree of certainty required by relevant law.
Our data processing activities do not include the sale of personal data, the use of personal data for targeting advertising, or the use of personal data for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, although we may disclose aggregated or depersonalized data with external sources, as described above. As a result, we do not honor rights to opt out of these practices in jurisdictions that recognize such rights.
You can also authorize another person, called an agent, to exercise your rights on your behalf. You must provide the authorized agent written and signed permission to act on your behalf. We may deny requests from an authorized agent who does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized to act on your behalf. Furthermore, we may require you to verify your identity directly with us. We may also require you to directly confirm with us that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit a request on your behalf.

To the extent that anything in this Section 10 conflicts with this Privacy Policy, this Section 10 shall govern.
The categories of California consumers’ personal data we may have collected are listed above in the Section – HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR DATA. We may disclose the following categories of data to our customers, although personal information is aggregated or depersonalized before it is shared: (1) Location, (2) Identifiers such as IP address, and (3) Internet or other electronic network activity information, all of which we have collected from your mobile device. We may collect the categories we’ve previously identified (which include GPS coordinates or similar information), network type, network operator, cellular and Wifi signal strength and quality, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and Wifi routers (including both BSSID and SSID). We also measure how data is flowing, both passively (by monitoring how fast it moves through other Mobile Applications), and actively (by running a test that downloads or uploads data within our SDK). We do not monitor the content of your data usage. The goal of collecting the above data is to measure the experience you have of wireless networks. We also collect information from environmental sensors on your device (depending on which ones are integrated in your device), this allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the external atmospheric pressure and light intensity. We also measure some internal device conditions – such as battery temperature and voltage. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how instantaneous device conditions affect the experience of wireless networks.
To better understand differences between devices, we collect data on your device hardware such as the model, manufacturer, and manufacturers and models of sub-components (such as the cellular radio) and the capabilities of these components (for example the number of cores on the CPU). Similarly, to understand differences caused by software, we collect information on the mobile platform version used and whether custom ROMs or Android skins are installed. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how device properties affect the experience of wireless networks.
When you first use a Mobile Application an identification code (“Resettable ID”), is randomly generated by our software and allocated to that installation instance rather than the device whenever we take measurements. A different and unique Resettable ID will be generated by each Mobile Application on a particular device. New installations of the same Mobile Application will also generate new unique Resettable IDs. Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, specific to Opensignal, and not shared externally. To further help us manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, as these may indicate which telecom carrier network is being accessed and is impacting your experience.
We use this data for the purposes listed above in the Section – THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE YOUR DATA. Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to create a detailed picture of the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time.
We may have shared certain categories of personal data listed in the Section - HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR DATA to the third parties listed in the Section - HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION for a business purpose and in order to provide the Opensignal Services. We may have shared the following categories of personal information: (1) Location, (2) Identifiers, such as IP addresses, and (3) Internet or other electronic network activity information, all of which we have collected from your mobile device. We may have shared the following categories of personal data with the following third parties or may do so in the following instances:
Service Providers
.
We may share datasets containing personal data with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with the Opensignal Services, such as cloud service providers for storage and the processing required for depersonalization. Where this information is shared with such third parties, we obligate the third-party service provider to manage the information only on our behalf, and on our written instructions and solely for our benefit (and not for its own benefit).
Business Change
.
If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer databases containing personal data to successor party or parties in connection with such transaction or change in ownership or legal structure.
Necessary Disclosure
.
Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Opensignal Services; (ii) comply with laws, subpoenas, warrants, court orders, legal processes or requests of government or law enforcement officials; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety or property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding known or suspected illegal activities; fraud; our rights, reputation, safety or property, or those of our users or others; violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements; or as otherwise required by law.
Subsidiaries and affiliates

ジャパンプライバシーポリシー.
Privacy Policy
This privacy policy describes the personal data Mapbox and/or its affiliates (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Mapbox”) may receive and why such personal data may be received in its capacity as a data controller, how such personal data may be used (including whom it may be shared with and for what purposes), and choices about such personal data.
This privacy policy applies to the extent Mapbox processes personal data in its capacity as a data controller under the GDPR (or “business” under the CCPA) when an individual: (a) visits and engages with any of Mapbox’s websites, (b) attends a virtual or in-person Mapbox event, (c) provides contact information for the purposes of Mapbox contacting about Mapbox products/services, (d) uses third-party websites or applications that cite this privacy policy, (e) provide billing information for Mapbox products/services account administration, or (f) apply to or are contacted about possible employment with Mapbox. Personal data is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq. and its implementing regulations (“CCPA”), or relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as "personal data").
This Privacy Policy does not apply when Mapbox acts as a data processor.  Most Mapbox customer personal data is not governed by this policy. Mapbox operates in the capacity of a data processor for certain personal data when operating Mapbox’s  products/services that are purchased by developers and businesses to develop their own licensed applications. As such, customers/prospective customers should read Mapbox’s data processing addendum (“DPA”):

which governs certain customer personal data that may be processed through use of Mapbox products/services including creation of a Mapbox products/services account. For other data not Processed by Mapbox as a Processor, e.g. billing and usage statistics data, see
Mapbox's Product Privacy Policy
.
Corporate Accounts: If any account created with Mapbox lists a corporate email address for a company with which an individual is currently (or was formerly) employed (a “Corporate Email”), then the corporate entity to whom the Corporate Email pertains is responsible for privacy practices relating to use of Corporate Email. If Corporate Email is used within the scope of this privacy policy (as described at the top of this privacy policy), then this privacy policy applies.  For clarification, commonly known personal email account services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) are not Corporate Email.

Therefore, personal data may be processed outside of the location from which it was received. Mapbox ensures that the transfer of personal data offers an adequate level of protection and security, for instance by entering into the appropriate agreements that continuously ensure the same level of protective measures as set forth in applicable data protection laws and regulations and certification certification under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework” or “DPF”), and, if required, standard contractual clauses or alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or other applicable regulators or legislators.
Mapbox’s Notice of Certification under the DPF, is available here:
https://www.mapbox.com/legal/notice-of-certification
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
4.1 Legal bases for processing personal data:
Some countries require that companies only process personal data if they have a “legal basis” (or justifiable need) to process personal data. To the extent those laws apply, Mapbox’s legal bases to process personal data are as follows:
To comply with a legal obligation to which Mapbox, as a controller, is subject.
To protect the vital interests of an individual or of another natural person.
For the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Mapbox as the controller or by an independent third party controller, except where the individual’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms override such interests.
Performance of the contract.
Consent.
In all cases of data processing on the basis of legitimate interests, Mapbox considers the impact on the rights and freedoms of the individuals whose data may be part of the processing, and ensures that its processing activities do not contradict or place at unreasonable risk any such rights or freedoms. Mapbox has assessed that these legitimate interests are not overridden by the data protection interests or fundamental rights of any individuals. In all cases, Mapbox ensures that such processing is legal, fair, and reasonable.
Retention
Mapbox stores personal data for so long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as described in Section 2 of this privacy policy.
Security
Mapbox takes steps designed to secure personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.  Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and Mapbox cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data it receives.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Mapbox does not accept liability for unintentional or accidental destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access.
‍
Children
Mapbox products/services, websites, events, and other communications are not intended or directed to children under the age of 18 (or other age of majority as required by local law), and Mapbox does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

Mapbox Product Privacy Policy
See Section 9 below for "California Notice At Collection"
Mapbox provides a location data platform that powers map and location services in a wide variety of web, mobile, game and embedded device applications. Mapbox customers are developers/companies who embed Mapbox software development kits (SDKs) or integrate with Mapbox application program interfaces (APIs) (collectively, “
Mapbox materials
”) in their licensed applications to enable maps and location features.
This product privacy policy
applies when Mapbox is processing personal data (sometimes referred to as personal information), from an end user of a licensed application (provided by Mapbox or one of its customers) that contains Mapbox materials, in its capacity (where legally applicable) as an independent data controller. For example, when Mapbox determines the purpose and means of processing such as making decisions about how to process personal data that benefits Mapbox customers generally, not just a single customer, Mapbox is processing as an independent data controller. In all cases, Mapbox’s processing of personal data continues to be controlled by its contracts with Mapbox customers, this product privacy policy and applicable data protection laws and regulations.
Personal data is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, or relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, or data defined as personal information or personal data under applicable data protection laws and regulations (in this policy, referred to as "
personal data
”).
Additional Privacy Policy:
Mapbox also processes as a data controller when individuals use any Mapbox website or engage with Mapbox marketing programs, including attending live or virtual events or applying for a job with Mapbox. Please see the applicable Mapbox privacy policy, available
here.
Personal Data Mapbox May Receive
Mapbox applies the principle of data minimization to its product development and operations in an effort to collect the least amount of personal data from the outset. The limited personal dataset that Mapbox may receive, outlined below, describes personal data categories and associated example data elements.  Please note, many data elements are only classified as personal data when combined with an associated IP address, other persistent identifier or data element capable of identifying or being reasonably linked to a natural person.
Data Category
Examples
Identifiers
Such as randomly generated billing ID, session ID & feedback ID (if given), and IP
address (to provide the service, for billing/security purposes and deleted after 30 days).

International Transfers
Personal data may be processed by one or more Mapbox affiliates, processors, or service providers in order to operate Mapbox’s business – for example, in the United States for account administration and billing. Therefore, personal data may be processed outside of the location from which it was received. Mapbox ensures that the transfer of personal data offers an adequate level of protection and security, for instance by entering into the appropriate agreements that continuously ensure the same level of protective measures as set forth in applicable data protection laws and regulations and certification certification under the EU-US, UK-US, Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework ("DPF"), and, if required, standard contractual clauses or alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or other applicable regulators or legislators.
Mapbox’s Notice of Certification under the DPF, is available here:
https://www.mapbox.com/legal/notice-of-certification
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
4.1 Legal bases for processing personal data:
Some countries require that companies only process personal data if they have a “legal basis” (or justifiable need) to process personal data. To the extent those laws apply, Mapbox’s legal bases to process personal data are as follows:
To comply with a legal obligation to which Mapbox, as a controller, is subject.
To protect the vital interests of an individual or of another natural person.
For the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Mapbox as the controller or by an independent third party controller, except where the individual’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms override such interests.
Performance of the contract.
Consent.
In all cases of data processing on the basis of legitimate interests, Mapbox considers the impact on the rights and freedoms of the individuals whose data may be part of the processing, and ensures that its processing activities do not contradict or place at unreasonable risk any such rights or freedoms. Mapbox has assessed that these legitimate interests are not overridden by the data protection interests or fundamental rights of any individuals. In all cases, Mapbox ensures that such processing is legal, fair, and reasonable.
Retention
Mapbox stores personal data for so long as Mapbox determines it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as described in Section 2 above. In determining how long to retain personal data, Mapbox considers the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the data, the purposes for which personal data is processed, applicable legal requirements, and Mapbox’s legitimate interests. The purposes for which Mapbox processes data may dictate different retention periods for the same types of data. For example, Mapbox retains IP addresses for 30 days and after such time, in select instances, may need to extend such retention period for an investigation based on its legitimate interests to secure its products and services, prevent fraud and for legal compliance purposes.
Security
Mapbox takes steps designed to secure personal data in accordance with this product privacy policy.  Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and Mapbox cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data it receives.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Mapbox does not accept liability for unintentional or accidental destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access.
Children
Mapbox products and services are not intended or directed to children under the age of 18 (or other age of majority as required by local law), and Mapbox does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If the parent or legal guardian learns that their child has provided Mapbox with personal data without their consent, then they should contact Mapbox as set forth below in the Contact Mapbox section of this product privacy policy. If Mapbox learns that it has collected personal data in violation of applicable data protection laws and regulations, it will promptly take steps to delete such personal data.
Choices About Personal Data
To the fullest extent possible, Mapbox will fulfill data subject rights requests provided it can match a data subject (natural person to whom the personal data in question pertains) to personal data that Mapbox processes. Mapbox does not, and is not required to, collect additional personal data in order to positively identify a data subject.
As outlined in Section 1 above, Mapbox receives only minimal personal data and operates controls designed to promptly de-identify and anonymize such personal data. For example, Mapbox deletes IP addresses within 30 days of receipt (unless required for an investigation), so it is unlikely that Mapbox would have personal data capable of identifying a data subject after 30 days of receiving such data. However, if verifiable and detailed information is available, Mapbox will work with the data subject to determine if the request can reasonably be met. The data subject will need to provide a valid email address so that Mapbox can communicate and support the request, as well as any information that Mapbox determines may be needed to verify whether it holds any applicable personal data.
In accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations and depending upon the data subject’s residency, the data subject to whom the personal data pertains may have the right to request the following regarding certain of their personal data:
Access/view/know personal data
Portability of personal data in a commonly machine readable format
Correct personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete
Deletion of certain personal data
Restrict or object to processing of personal data
Opt-out of the “sale” or “share” or processing for “targeted advertising” (each as defined by applicable data protection laws and regulations) of personal data , if applicable, where such requests are permitted by law
To request deletion of certain personal data, please complete the form
here
. For any other request to exercise rights, please contact Mapbox at
privacy@mapbox.com
. The requesting email must come from the data subject to whom the personal data pertains and include the data subject’s name, email address and specific request or question. To protect privacy, Mapbox will take steps to verify the identity of the requestor before fulfilling the request. Mapbox will process such requests in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations.
To the extent required in the state where the data subject resides and where Mapbox has denied such data subject’s earlier request, the data subject may file an appeal with Mapbox for reconsideration. To file an appeal, please contact Mapbox at privacy@mapbox.com. The requesting email must come from the data subject to whom the personal data pertains and include the data subject’s name, email address and reference to the specific request and denial.
Mapbox encourages data subjects to contact it directly with any questions or complaints. However, Mapbox acknowledges and informs the data subject that they have the right to lodge a complaint in the EU and UK with the appropriate supervisory authority in the applicable jurisdiction; .; and in select United States states, to contact the respective state’s Attorney General’s Office, whose contact information may be identified here https://www.usa.gov/state-attorney-general (or successor link). In some cases, these rights may be subject to exceptions, as permitted by applicable law.

Privacy & Security FAQ
Last Updated:  Aug 22, 2023
Mapbox provides a location data platform that powers maps and location services. Mapbox provides SDKs (software   development   kits)   and   APIs   (application   programming   interfaces),   which   businesses   and developers use to incorporate Mapbox mapping and navigation technologies into the licensed applications and  websites  they  make.  The  SDKs  contain  libraries  of  software  code  which  are  incorporated  into  a customer’s  licensed  application  or  website.  These  libraries  of  software  code  facilitate  API  requests  to Mapbox’s location data platform (which is a backend data server, hosted in the cloud (AWS-US)) which then responds with map and location content to the customer’s application or website.
In addition, Mapbox offers an on-premise version of its location data services, called Atlas.
No.
Mapbox does not sell personal data.
No.
For customers on a monthly active user (“MAU”) billing model, Mapbox maintains counts of MAUs for billing purposes only. Mapbox does not (and cannot) track an end user’s activity across billing cycles and does not build targeted profiles with the data processed through its products/services.
Data Category
Examples
Identifiers
Such as randomly generated billing ID, session ID & feedback ID (if given), and IP address (to provide the service, for billing/security purposes and deleted after 30 days).
Commercial Information
Such as user agent, which may include an application ID (determined by the Mapbox customer to identify its application), Mapbox customer’s account ID (so that Mapbox knows which company to bill) and Mapbox product name(s) and version(s). Such as data that an individual may upload to Mapbox products/services or otherwise provide to Mapbox in connection with support, or feedback that end  users  voluntarily  contribute  to  Mapbox  along  with  their  associated contact information.
Internet or other electronic network activity
Such as timestamp accompanying received data elements, an end user’s abandonment of a given navigation route / use of an alternate navigation route;
Such as connectivity and device data including device model and browser information, operating system, and contents of an API or SDK request.
Geolocation Data
Such as latitude and longitude, altitude, horizontal and vertical accuracy (the session ID association is broken within 24 hours.)Applies only to Navigation SDK: If Mapbox Copilot is enabled, Mapbox receives detailed full trip trace files and searchresults of navigation sessions. Mapbox Copilot is disabled by default and may only be enabled by Mapbox Navigationcustomers (not end users) in their licensed applications.At any time, end users may change their location permissions for a given licensed application through their mobiledevice and choose to disable access to location data. Such change may affect the designed functionality of the licensed application.
Mapbox applies the principle of data minimization to product development and operations in an effort to collect only limited  data  from  the  outset. Mapbox  operates  a  number  of  technical  and  organization measures regarding the limited personal dataset that we process, such as strict access controls and prompt deletion of raw log files that contain IP addresses and billing IDs. Mapbox deploys regular ID rotation and 1-way hashing for billing IDs, which must be retained for accounting and billing purposes, to minimize the ability  to  track  user  requests over time. Billing  IDs  are  not  transmitted with  unrelated  events,  further reducing  the  feasibility  of  correlating  a  user’s  activities  over  time.  In  addition, Mapbox operates  strict anonymization procedures, such as clipping traces, for telemetry events that send location data.
Communication   through   the   Internet   requires   the   presence   of   IP   addresses,   which   specify   each transmission’s  origin  and  destination.  When  end  users  engage  with  applications  that  access  Mapbox products/services through the Internet, the end user necessarily discloses their current IP address to one or more Mapbox servers. IP addresses are retained in cloudfront logs for 30 days for billing and customer usage reporting, unless involved in an ongoing security, anti-fraud, or misuse investigation.
Mapbox  receives  location  data  when  a  Mapbox  customer’s  end  users  uses  a  licensed  application  that incorporates Mapbox mobile SDKs and the end user has authorized the licensed application’s use of the end user’s device location via their mobile phone or device operating system.
Location  data  includes  fields  such  as  latitude  and  longitude,  altitude,  horizontal  and  vertical  accuracy,  a session  ID  rotating  every  24  hours,  and  origin  IP  address  (as  would  any  Internet  communication).   The  IP address that accompanies location data is retained at the load balancer (where it is used for security and PUBLISHED: Aug 22, 2023https://www.mapbox.com/legal/legal-faq Mapbox Customer FAQ, Page 3billing  purposes  and  discarded  after  30  days).  This  IP  address  is  not  forwarded  to  the  location  telemetry processing pipeline. Location data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and is subject to the principle of least access, with the minimal number of personnel and processes having access to it in its pre-aggregated form.
In the location data anonymization pipeline, the location data is then anonymized by clipping off the origin and destination of the trip and further dividing the trip into segments, which cannot be reassembled. The anonymized  location   data  is  then  used  to  improve  Mapbox  mapping  products,   including  the  Traffic  and Movement data products.
In AWS in the United States.
However, for performance purposes, Mapbox regularly caches content on its AWS  content  delivery  network  (“CDN”)  located  in  various  regions.

No.
Mapbox’s  products/services  store  and  serve  source  data  from  an  AWS  primary  region  in  the  US.  As noted  above,  data  is  cached  and  served  out  of  various  regions  outside  the  US  for  performance  reasons, however  Mapbox  cannot  serve  its  data  from  one  limited  geographic  region.  To  comply  with  GDPR  and safeguard transfers to the US and other countries, please see
Mapbox's DPA, Schedule C

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google
to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

Delete your content from
specific Google services

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data

specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data

Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.

Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
