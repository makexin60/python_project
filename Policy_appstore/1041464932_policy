Privacy Policy
The medical data you enter in
MedCalX
is only stored locally on the device.
This data is encrypted by the operating system
if you have a passcode set
on your device.
At no point does the data leave the device, except when you decide to print or email from within the app.
This means that neither the MedCalX developers nor Apple can glimpse at your data.
This is your private data.
Patient Cloud Storage
The app currently does not offer online (
“cloud”
) data storage, but we might add this feature in the future.
Should we add this feature we will
not
automatically transition you to cloud storage but will give you the opportunity to do so or keep your data locally.
User Details
We do not currently ask for your email address or other contact information, nor does Apple provide such data about app users to the developers.
Usage Reports
MedCalX can send anonymized usage reports that help us improve the app.
We do not collect any personal information.
This usage information will not be sold to third parties and will only be used to improve the feature set of the application.
In addition, we may publish insights of interest to the medical community gained from this data on websites or scholarly journals.
The sending of reports can be disabled at any time by turning off the option in the Settings section of the application.
Doximity Members
We collect the account IDs of users that unlock formulas through the Doximity In-App purchase.
This information will only be communicated to Doximity as part of the registration verification process.
