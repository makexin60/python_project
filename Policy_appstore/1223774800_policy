At LILYSILK and its subsidiaries, we are committed to providing you with clear information and
                    significant control over your personal data collection and usage. This Privacy Policy describes our
                    practices pertaining to the processing of personal data collected via our websites, mobile applications,
                    and any other online services where this Privacy Policy is accessible (collectively referred to as our
                    online services). It also outlines how we handle personal data when you interact with us offline, such
                    as when you patronize our physical stores, reach out to our customer service team, or participate in our
                    events.
In this context, personal data refers to information related to an identifiable individual, in
                    accordance with the definition under applicable law.
Our adherence to this Privacy Policy complies with the laws applicable in the regions where we operate.
                    On occasion, we may issue supplementary terms related to specific products and services or specific
                    regions. These additional terms should be understood in conjunction with this Privacy Policy, while
                    region-specific terms apply independently.
While we aim for consistent application of privacy laws, certain terms, obligations, and rights may only
                    be applicable or available to individuals in specific jurisdictions. The use of the term "right" in this
                    Privacy Policy (and any supplements) does not imply or confer any legal rights or remedies to any person
                    or party, unless expressly stipulated under applicable law.

                            categories of personal data we collect, the reasons for the collection or usage, and whether the
                            personal data is "sold" or "shared" (as these terms may be defined by privacy laws).

                                    and we will not attempt to re-identify such data, except as permitted by applicable law.

                            other information related to your request.
Authorized agents can make a request on your behalf using the Privacy Requests Form, but they'll
                            need to provide written proof that you gave them signed permission to submit the request.
Opting out of Sharing for Targeted Advertising:
We may share personal information with other parties to provide analytics services and serve ads
                            on our behalf, which are targeted to your interests and based on your online activities.
                            Although we don't exchange personal information for money, certain uses may be deemed the “sale”
                            or “sharing” of personal information under applicable privacy laws.
To opt-out of these uses of your personal information, please visit the “Your Privacy Choices”
                            link located at the bottom of our sites and within our mobile apps under Customer Service. Use
                            our Privacy Preference Page and Webform to indicate your preference.
Please remember
Opt-out tools are specific to the browser or device you use. If you’re not signed-in to
                                    your customer account or don’t have a customer account, you will need to opt-out on each
                                    browser and device you use.
Even after opting out, you may still see online ads, but they won't be based on your
                                    inferred interests.
Clearing your browser's cookies and cache may remove opt-out preferences, necessitating
                                    you to opt-out again.
While we use necessary cookies for our sites to function, you may disable these through
                                    your browser settings, which may affect site functionality.
You can control targeted ads you receive within apps by using your device manufacturer's
                                    settings and choices.
More information on controlling targeted advertising is available from the Digital
                                    Advertising Alliance (www.optout.aboutads.info) and the European Interactive Digital
                                    Advertising Alliance (www.edaa.eu).
We endeavor to fulfill requests within the time frames stipulated by applicable law, which may
                            take up to 30 or 45 days depending on your location.
Reasons for Denying a Request and Exceptions
Your request may be denied if we cannot verify your identity. One way we verify your identity is
                            by confirming your email address. If you do not respond timely to our request to confirm your
                            email address or provide other requested information necessary for us to verify your identity or
                            process your request, we may deny your request.
If you request the deletion of your personal information, we may not be able to delete certain
                            data if it is required for us to process your purchases, fulfill your orders (including returns
                            or exchanges), or provide requested services.
We may not be able to honor your request if it restricts our ability to comply with applicable
                            law (such as cooperating with law enforcement) or our regulatory obligations (like maintaining
                            records of your requests and preferences). We may also deny your request if we, in good faith,
                            believe that the information is necessary to exercise or defend a legal claim, or protect our
                            operations and property, or the privacy, safety, and property of others.
If we deny your request, you can appeal our decision by writing to us using the contact details
                            provided under the "Contact us" section of this Privacy Policy. If you have concerns about the
                            results of an appeal, you can contact the supervisory authority in your area.
Non-Discrimination:
We do not discriminate against anyone for exercising their privacy rights or making requests.
Automated Individual Decision-Making:
We do not make decisions about you based solely on automated processing of your personal
                            information, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly
                            affects you, unless necessary for entering or performing a contract with you based on your
                            explicit consent, or as authorized by applicable law.
Email Marketing:
You can opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by clicking the
                            “unsubscribe” link in such emails. Please note that even if you opt-out of marketing or
                            promotional emails, we may still send you transactional communications, such as those related to
                            your purchases or Loyalty Rewards Program.
Text Message Marketing:
You can opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional texts from us by clicking the unsubscribe
                            link provided in the SMS or by following other instructions provided to you when you chose to
                            receive texts. If you have signed up for texts from more than one list, you will need to opt-out
                            from each list separately.
Co-Branded, Co-Sponsored, or Cross-Promotional Offerings:
If you choose to participate in a co-branded, co-sponsored, or cross-promotional offering, the
                            brand, sponsor, or other third party involved may use your information for their own purposes,
                            including advertising and marketing. You must contact the relevant third party directly to
                            exercise your opt-out choices with respect to their use of your information.
Push Notifications:
If an online service enables push notifications on your device, you can review and update your
                            push notification preferences by adjusting the settings provided by your device manufacturer.
                            Deactivation may not apply to our in-app notifications and alerts.
Sensitive Personal Information
We do not make use of or disclose sensitive personal information unless it's
                            necessary for providing the goods or executing the services you have requested (like processing
                            or fulfilling orders and transactions), with your explicit consent, or as otherwise authorized
                            by the applicable law (such as for preventing, detecting, and investigating security incidents,
                            ensuring physical safety, and displaying non-personalized advertising as part of your current
                            interaction with us). We do not utilize or reveal sensitive personal information for the purpose
                            of inferring characteristics about you.
Children’s privacy
We do not intentionally collect personal information directly from children
                            under the age of 13 (or 16 in the United Kingdom or European Union) without parental consent.
                            Our online services are designed for a general audience and are not specifically targeted or
                            intended for use by children.
Retention of personal information
We retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
                            collected unless a longer retention period is mandated or allowed by the applicable law.
Data transfers
Our operations and vendors are spread across the United States, Canada, and other countries,
                            which means we may transfer, store, or access your personal information in jurisdictions that
                            may not provide data protection levels equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. We ensure
                            adequate protection for the transfer of personal information in line with the applicable law,
                            such as by obtaining your consent, setting up contractual obligations with our service providers
                            and third parties, relying on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions, or implementing
                            Standard Contractual Clauses. As allowed by the applicable law, you may request a copy of these
                            Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting our representative in the United Kingdom and European
                            Union mentioned in the "Contact us" section of this Privacy Policy.
Information safeguards
Our objective is to ensure safe and convenient experiences when you interact with us. To protect
                            your personal information, we implement technical and organizational measures. Please note, we
                            will never send you an email requesting personal information, such as your account access
                            credentials, date of birth, or credit card information. Additionally, we will never send emails
                            with openable attachments. If you receive a suspicious email appearing to be from us, please get
                            in touch as identified in the "Contact Us" section of this privacy policy.
Third-party sites and platforms
When you submit information to us on third-party-operated sites, apps, and other platforms, the
                            information may also be separately collected by these third-party operators. Furthermore, our
                            content, products, services, or ads could be available on third-party content distribution
                            channels. The information we gather is governed by this Privacy Policy, while the data collected
                            by third-party operators falls under their respective privacy policies. Privacy preferences you
                            set on third-party sites, apps, platforms, or content distribution channels will not apply to
                            our use of information collected directly via our online services. Please be aware that our
                            online services may contain links to other sites and platforms outside our control. We are not
                            responsible for the privacy practices of these sites and platforms. We advise you to read the
                            privacy policies of all third parties that may apply when you leave our online services.
Policy revisions and updates
We may periodically revise and update this Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to review it
                            regularly. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the policy.
                            If we make significant changes, we will provide additional notice, such as placing a statement
                            on our website homepages or sending you a notification.

Applicable Law
We are committed to protecting your personal information and the rights set out  
                            in this Policy reflect your rights under applicable laws.
Applicable laws for the purpose of this Policy means: (a) the Data Protection  
                            Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive)  
                            Regulations 2013; (b) General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)  
                            2016/679) (“GDPR”) until such time as it might cease to apply in the UK; and  
                            (c) to the extent applicable, any legislation ratifying or otherwise adopting  
                            the GDPR in the UK, and any applicable associated or supplementary data  
                            protection laws or regulations.
We recognize that as an international business, some of our customers are  
                            resident in jurisdictions other than England and Wales. In certain  
                            circumstances, local laws of these jurisdictions, may by way of their  
                            application, afford rights to a customer in respect of the personal data that  
                            they provide to us. We anticipate that the rights set out in this Policy also  
                            provide you with such protection in relation to your personal information.

                            additional questions you may have.
