LEGAL BASES FOR COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
Certain jurisdictions require that we identify a legal basis or business purpose for our collection and processing of your Personal Information. This includes:
Contract performance
. This applies where your Personal Information is necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.
Legitimate Interest(s)
. This applies when the collection and processing of your Personal Information is done to achieve a legitimate interest for us and does not outweigh any prejudice to your rights. We rely on this basis, for example, when we:
- Provide recommendations and information to improve the user experience;
- Send you information or direct marketing materials relating to our products and services; or
- Prevent fraud or ensure security of our network and systems.
Your Consent
. This applies when our collection and processing is based on your consent. In certain circumstances, your consent may be implied based on your continued use of our website or the Squire Services or submission of your Personal Information in order to receive Squire Services.
Legal claims
. This applies where your Personal Information is necessary for us to defend, prosecute or make a claim against you, us or a third party.
In jurisdictions that designate parties as data controllers or business and processors or service providers, Squire is a data controller and a business within the meaning of applicable law with respect to the collection, use, and other processing of Personal Information.
If you choose not to provide Personal Information that is reasonably required to provide any Squire Services, it may hinder Squire’s ability to provide the requested information or services.

Integrated Partners and Service Providers
.

HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS
Squire will comply with an individual’s requests in accordance with applicable law.
We may deny certain requests, or fulfill a request only in part, based on our legal rights and obligations. For example, we may retain Personal Information as permitted by law, such as for tax or other record keeping purposes, to maintain an active account, and to process transactions and facilitate customer requests.
You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent, please include written permission that you have designated that agent to make the request, or proof of the agent’s power of attorney. We may follow up with you to verify your identity before processing your authorized agent’s request.
We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your requests and—except as required by applicable law—can only honor verified requests. The verification steps will vary depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and whether you have an account with us. This process may require you to provide identifying Personal Information—such as your data of birth and last for digits of your government identification numbers—or to send us an email from the email address associated with your account. Please note that we cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity, the identity of your authorized agent, or the authority of your authorized agent to make the request.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
You may exercise the above rights by emailing us at
privacy@getsquire.com
.

Information About Platform Permissions.
Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. These platforms may have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. For example, the iOS platform will alert you the first time the Squire app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request.
Location Information.
We request permission for our app’s collection of precise location from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can disable it at any time by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of the Squire Services. Additionally, disabling our app’s collection of precise location from your device will not limit our ability to derive approximate location from your IP address.
Contact Information.
We may also seek permission for our app’s collection and syncing of contact information from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, users can later disable it by changing the contacts settings on your mobile device.
