How we obtain your consent depends on the type of personal information we are collecting and the purposes for collecting that personal information.

Enrollment forms – we ask for express consent when you complete an enrollment form for benefits
Claims submissions – when you submit claims (paper or online) we ask for express consent
Plan Administrators – Plan Administrators may seek your consent in their communications with you
Providers – Your Providers may obtain your consent when you complete our forms in order to facilitate direct payment
We may rely on your implied consent when we provide you with notice of this privacy policy and you do not opt-out from uses of your personal information. For example, we rely on opt-out consent for advertising and marketing, including personalization. See our section on
personalization
for more information.
In some cases, we are permitted or required by law to collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent. For example, we may collect, use or disclose your personal information as part of an investigation without your consent in order to prevent insurance abuse and/or fraud. We may also disclose your personal information to governmental authorities, including the police, if we are required to do so by law.
Data Analytics
Data analytics is the science of using data to discover useful information and to support decision-making. Data analytics at Pacific Blue Cross involves collecting and using your personal information as well as pooling and analyzing information from many individuals in order to obtain insights about you. We perform data analytics for many purposes, including:
to understand what benefits and services our members and dependents find useful
to understand how we are performing against our objectives
to identify areas in which we can improve the customer service experience
to make our member portal, our website pages, and our advertising and marketing more effective
to conduct underwriting and actuarial analysis
to prevent, detect and respond to insurance abuse and/or fraud and other threats to our business
to identify ways of meeting the needs of members and dependents in a cost-effective and efficient manner
Some of our data analytics tools use data and initial instructions to train a computer to look for patterns and trends. The computer can assist our personnel, such as by helping to identify insurance abuse and/or fraud or to anticipate what might interest our members.
Personalization
We want to understand the experience of our members and their dependents in using our benefits and services. We also want to provide you with information that is relevant to you. We do this by combining data from our interactions with you. This data includes the information from the benefits and services you apply for and use, your interactions with our customer service representatives, your interactions with the member portal and our websites, and your interactions with our advertising and marketing team.
We combine this data and use it to develop a better understanding of your interests and potential needs. We use those insights to personalize our interactions with you. This includes making our advertising and marketing more relevant and contacting you about benefits and services we anticipate will be of interest to you.
For example, we may use information you provide to us about your age and number of dependents as well as information we collect about your interactions with the member portal, our websites, our email and phone communications with you, your service requests, and our other interactions with you, in order to make product and service recommendations that fit your personal circumstances.
You may opt-out of receiving personalized advertising and marketing at any time by contacting us. See the section on
your rights and options
for more information.
Insurance abuse and/or fraud
We may collect, use and disclose your personal information, including with you and Your Provider, as well as with our third party experts and investigators, for the purposes of conducting internal reviews and investigations to prevent and respond to insurance abuse and/or fraud. Your personal information may include your name, date of birth, claim history, and information derived from your customer interactions with us, such as your IP address. For instance, we may collect from and disclose your personal information to Your Provider to confirm that claims, which are submitted to us for payment either by you or Your Provider, are not submitted with the purpose of obtaining, or attempting to obtain, a payment to which the person is not entitled, or which is submitted in a way that is contrary to the intended purposes of the benefit plan.  Such initiatives not only address potential insurance abuse and/or fraud by members, but by Your Providers who direct bill us on your behalf.  Your personal information will in such cases be disclosed by Your Provider to us upon receiving a written request from us and without your further consent.  We may disclose your personal information to the police, or to Your Provider’s regulatory body, if we believe that Your Provider and/or you are engaging in insurance abuse and/or fraud.
We may use your personal information for the purposes of training a computer to detect trends as well as to conduct data analytics, such as risk assessments, in order to prevent and respond to insurance abuse and/or fraud. We may also pool your personal information with information belonging to other individuals for the same purposes.
First Nations clients – important information
For our First Nations clients, we may collect from, use and disclose your personal information to the First Nations Health Authority, including details of your services being received and claimed, for the purposes of delivering our benefits to you, coordinating our benefits with other benefits to which you may be entitled, investigating insurance abuse and/or fraud, and meeting our contractual obligations to the First Nations Health Authority.  The First Nations Health Authority is contractually obliged to use your personal information that it obtains from us for the purposes of overseeing and coordinating your health benefits, determining your eligibility for benefits, accessing and improving your benefits, meeting its contractual obligations with us, and other purposes as set out in the contract.
HBT, JCBT, JFBT and JHSBT clients – important information
If your Plan Administrator is one of the following health benefits trusts, namely the Healthcare Benefit Trust (“HBT”), the Joint Community Benefits Trust (“JCBT”), the Joint Facilities Benefits Trust (“JFBT”), or the Joint Health Science Benefits Trust (“JHSBT”), Pacific Blue Cross is contractually obliged to disclose your personal information, including your claim and payment details, to the applicable health benefits trust, or to HBT as the administrative agent of these health benefits trusts, for the purposes of allowing these health benefits trusts to meet their obligations, such as ensuring that our claims processing is in accordance with our contractual obligations, and ensuring that you are provided with efficient and cost-effective solutions for your benefits. We encourage you to contact the Privacy Officer of these health benefits trusts with any further questions, or to contact our Privacy Officer, who can put you in touch with the Privacy Officers of these health benefits trusts.
Security, Retention and Destruction
We employ reasonable safeguards to protect your personal information. The safeguards we use depend on the sensitivity of the information. Examples of how we protect your personal information include:
requiring confidentiality agreements as a condition of employment
restricting access to personal information to employees who need access to it
employee privacy and security training
using encrypted connections, strong passwords, multifactor authentication, firewalls and other technical security tools
physical measures such as locked storage areas and restricted access to our offices and other areas where personal information is stored
If we use your personal information to make a decision about you, we will retain that personal information for at least one year. The retention period we apply to personal information depends on why we collected it. In some cases, we may be required to keep your personal information after our last interaction with you for tax, accounting, legal, and other valid business reasons. We may also be required to retain your personal information to manage our relationship with you after your benefits expire, including responding to your inquiries, communicating about outstanding claims and your former benefits, resolving disputes regarding claims and, if necessary, for litigation purposes.
We may send advertising and marketing communications to you after your benefits expire at the termination of your policy. You may unsubscribe or opt-out of receiving advertising and marketing communications at any time by contacting us. See the section on
your rights and options
for more information.
We will securely destroy or de-identify your personal information once we no longer need your personal information, in accordance with our records retention obligations and practices.
International transfers
We may use some service providers and online services that are located outside of Canada, and we may transfer your personal information to them. If we do so, we will comply with any contractual obligations as well as the applicable privacy legislation.
