Retention of Personal Information
We retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you Services or for other purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, or as required or permitted by applicable law. For more information about the criteria for retaining personal information listed above, please refer to storage periods identified from Section 3.1 to Section 3.9 above.
Shine the Light
In addition to the CCPA, California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if a California customer has exercised an option to opt out of such information sharing. We have such a policy. If you want to opt out of any such sharing of your information, please contact us using the information below.
Do Not Track
Your browser may allow you to adjust your browser settings so that “do not track” requests are sent to the websites that you visit. However, since uniform standards for “DNT" signals have not been adopted, we do not disable tracking technology that may be active on the Sites in response to any “do not track” requests that we receive from your browser.
