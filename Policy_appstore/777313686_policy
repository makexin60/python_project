Privacy Policy
Vantage Calendar is provided by Fortyfour AB. Fortyfour AB collects a minimum amount of user data strictly for product improvement purposes. We track things like what color packs are most popular so that we can create more along those lines and similar aggregated information. We keep crash reports so we know if there’s an issue and how to correct it. We do not store any personally identifiable information with the only exception being our newsletter, which is opt-in.  We have no way of reading your calendar events outside of your device, since we don’t keep them on any servers or third party services. All your calendar events are stored in your regular calendar account, for example iCloud, Google or Exchange.
This policy is effective as of 16th December 2018, and can change without notice.
