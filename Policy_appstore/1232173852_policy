What our customers think
What I liked - the fast approach of the business manager (the agent who collects the doc and manages the insurance policy), the behaviour of the agent, the honesty and price.

Efficiency!!! The app is easy to use. Uploading forms is easy!! I don't have to go to the HR to give materials and ask how my claim is doing. I can go directly to Sukoon.
