SilverCloud also uses some of your data to understand how the SilverCloud platform is used and could be improved. When we collect or use your data on our own behalf, SilverCloud is the ‘data controller’.
There is a separate
privacy notice for people who use the SilverCloud company website and for people who we communicate with for marketing purposes
.
