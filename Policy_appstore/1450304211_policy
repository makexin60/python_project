ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT & CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. APPLICABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
‍
Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or the use of the Services - other than any Financial Products & Services related to the Super.com Card or Super.com Deposit Account, which are governed by the Super.com Deposit Account Agreement and the Super.com Secured Credit Card Agreement - (each, a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration, unless expressly provided otherwise in this Section, and not in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Super.com agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (or equivalent laws in the jurisdiction in which the Super.com entity that you have contracted with is incorporated) governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and that YOU AND SUPER.COM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. This Section shall survive the termination of these Terms.
‍
Exceptions and Opt-out Option. The only exceptions to this Section are the following: (1) you or Super.com each may seek to resolve an individual Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; (2) you or Super.com each may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our respective intellectual property rights; or (3) you may opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute individually if you provide us with a signed, written notice of your decision to do so pursuant to the conditions below; however, if you are opting out of an updated version of this arbitration provision, you understand that you will remain subject to the prior version of any arbitration provision to which you had previously agreed.
‍
Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification. You and Super.com agree that, prior to initiating an arbitration or other legal proceeding, you and Super.com will attempt to negotiate an informal resolution of the Dispute. To begin this process, and before initiating any arbitration or legal proceeding against Super.com, you must send a Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) to the attention of Super.com’s Legal Department at
legalrequests@super.com
. For purposes of these Terms, initiating an arbitration means filing an arbitration demand (“Demand”).
‍
Your Notice to Super.com must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name, address, and the email address associated with your Super.com User Account; (2) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (3) a description of the relief you want, including any money damages you request; and (4) your signature verifying the accuracy of the Notice and, if you are represented by counsel, authorizing Super.com to disclose information about you to your attorney.
‍
After receipt of your Notice, you and Super.com shall engage in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of sixty (60) days, which both sides may extend by written agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Period”). During the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, neither you nor Super.com may initiate an arbitration or other legal proceeding. If the Dispute is not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, you may initiate an individual arbitration as provided below.
‍
Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. Any arbitration must be initiated with and conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) pursuant to its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (together, the “NAM Rules”), except as modified by these Terms. The NAM Rules are available at
www.NAMADR.org
. In any instance where the applicable NAM Rules and these Terms are inconsistent, these Terms shall control. An arbitration Demand filed with NAM must include a certification signed by the filing party verifying compliance with the Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification requirements and other requirements set out in this Section. If NAM fails or declines to conduct the arbitration for any reason, we will mutually select a different arbitration administrator. If we cannot agree, a court will appoint the arbitration administrator. Any arbitration hearing will take place in or nearest to the county or municipality where you live, unless you and Super.com agree to a different location or to a virtual hearing. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement, except that only a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in these Terms (and not an arbitrator) shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver set forth in these Terms or the Mass Filing procedures set forth in the Sections below are unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable.
‍
MASS FILING PROCEDURES.
YOU AND SUPER.COM AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF US IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A MASS ARBITRATION.
Super.com’s receipt of one or more Notice(s) of substantially similar claims brought by or on behalf of twenty-five (25) or more claimants (including you) within a sixty (60) day period (“Mass Filing”) shall be subject to the additional procedures set forth below. Claims included in a Mass Filing, if not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, may proceed only in accordance with the procedures set out below, and subject to the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM Mass Filing Rules”, available at
https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/
”) to the extent not contrary to these Terms. If a court determines that any part of this Section is not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim may only proceed individually in court consistent with the remaining Terms.
‍
A. First (Bellwether) Batch. The first batch of up to fifty (50) Demands are the Bellwether Arbitrations. If your claim is included in the Bellwether Arbitrations, you and Super.com shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the initial pre-hearing conference.
‍
‍B. Stay of Filing of Other Claims. If your claim is not among those selected for the Bellwether Arbitrations, your claim cannot be filed until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed in a later stage of this process. No arbitration fees will be assessed on you or Super.com in connection with your claim unless and until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed with NAM.
‍
‍C. Mediation. After the Bellwether Arbitrations are completed, if your claim remains unresolved, you and Super.com agree to mediate your claim along with any other unresolved claims included in the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”). The mediator will be selected according to the procedure set forth in the NAM Rules, and Super.com will pay the mediator’s fees. The Global Mediation shall be completed within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the selection of a mediator, unless extended by written agreement between you and Super.com.
‍
‍D. Election To Proceed in Court. If Global Mediation is not successful in resolving your claim, and one hundred (100) or more claims included in the Mass Filing remain unresolved, you or Super.com may opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim resolved in court consistent with these Terms. You or Super.com must exercise this election within forty-five (45) days of the completion of Global Mediation.
‍
‍E. Sequential Arbitration of Remaining Batches. If neither you nor Super.com opt out of arbitration, another batch of no greater than fifty (50) individuals’ claims will be selected from the Mass Filing, with twenty-five (25) claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than fifty) selected by counsel for claimants and twenty-five (25) claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than fifty) selected by Super.com. If your claim is included in this next batch of fifty (50) claims, your claim will be filed with NAM, and you and Super.com shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the initial pre-hearing conference. The process of batching up to fifty (50) individual claims at a time will continue until the parties resolve all claims included in the Mass Filing. No unbatched claim can proceed to be filed as a Demand until the previous batch has been resolved.
‍
Tolling. For any claim subject to these Mass Filing procedures, any statute of limitations applicable to your claim shall be tolled from the date the Informal Dispute Resolution Period begins until the earlier of (1) the date your arbitration Demand is filed, or (2) the date you or Super.com opts out of arbitration pursuant to these Terms.
‍
Location of Arbitration. Any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, in (a) the county, parish, or province in which you reside; (b) the State of Delaware; (c) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator; or (d) by telephone or videoconference.
‍
Arbitration Costs. Payment of all arbitration filing fees and costs will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules. If you prevail on your claim in arbitration, Super.com will reimburse you for any portion of the arbitration filing fees you paid that exceeded the amount you would have paid to file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to these Terms. If Super.com prevails on your claim in arbitration, and the arbitrator finds that your claim was frivolous or filed in bad faith, the arbitrator may award Super.com reimbursement from you of Super.com’s arbitration filing fees and costs.
‍
‍Offer of Settlement. Super.com may, but is not obligated to, make a written offer to settle your claim at least fourteen (14) days before the arbitration hearing date. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If an award is issued in your favor but is less than Super.com’s settlement offer, the arbitrator may order you to pay the arbitration costs incurred by Super.com after its offer was made, unless otherwise prohibited by the underlying law governing your claim.
‍
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
YOU AND SUPER.COM AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS (WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLAIMANT, OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THIS ALSO MEANS THAT YOU AND SUPER.COM MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY THIRD PARTY.  NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PROVISION OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE IN THESE TERMS, YOU OR SUPER.COM MAY PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-WIDE SETTLEMENT. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND SUPER.COM WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
‍
Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding what is stated in Paragraph 5 of these Terms of Use, if Super.com changes any terms of this Section after the date you first accepted these Terms or any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use, you may reject the new changes to this Section by sending us written notice to
legalrequests@super.com
within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the later of (1) the “Last Updated” date of the Terms of Use you seek to reject or (2) the date of Super.com’s email to you notifying you of such change. Even if you reject a change, you will remain subject to the last version of the Terms of Use you had accepted.
‍
‍Severability. If any portion of this Section is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Section and all other Terms of Use shall continue to be enforceable and valid.

Super+ Membership Services may change from time to time, and certain Super+ Membership Services may be discontinued or others may be added..
‍
From time to time, Super.com offers some users trial or other promotional offers towards a Super+ Membership. Such trial or promotional memberships are subject to these Terms of Use except as otherwise stated in the promotional offer, including which users are eligible for the promotional memberships. Only one trial or promotional membership is available per household and may not be combined with any other promotion.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL MEMBERSHIP BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION PROCEDURE DESCRIBED ABOVE.

If you have a free trial or a promotional membership and you cancel your Super+ Membership, your access to your membership benefits will end upon cancellation.

Access to the Super+ Membership Services may be subject to Additional Terms, which are hereby incorporated by reference. If there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and the Additional Terms, such Additional Terms will take precedence with respect to the specific aspects of the Super+ Membership Services to which it applies.
Fees
Your Super+ Membership fee is stated in the “My Account” section of the Super.com App. From time to time, we may offer different membership terms, and the fees for such membership may vary. The Super+ Membership fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use.
Renewal
UNLESS YOU CANCEL, BY DEFAULT (AND WITH PRIOR NOTICE TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE AGREED UPON MONTHLY OR ANNUAL TERM, AND THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOU AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL TO YOUR LINKED PAYMENT METHOD. UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR NOT AUTO RENEW BASED ON THE PROCESS IN THE MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION SECTION, YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.
Payment
Your Super+ Membership fee will be automatically charged to your linked payment method in USD currency. Super+ Membership fees are payable monthly or annually in advance. When you purchase your Super+ Membership, you'll be charged the membership fee for your first billing cycle on the date of purchase, which activates the monthly or annual renewable Super+ Membership. Unless you cancel, you'll be charged based on the billing date and billing cycle indicated on your “My Account” page when logged into the Site or in the Super.com App. In certain circumstances, your billing date may change; for instance, if we are unable to successfully charge your card for the Super+ Membership fee on a given day (e.g., a Federal holiday or technical failures). If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment for your Super+ Membership fee, Super.com may automatically retry your selected payment method for the full amount or some portion thereof periodically over the course of your billing cycle to help you get back to enjoying the benefits of your membership, and/or may attempt to charge another payment method that we have on file. If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you continue to be declined, you must provide us a new eligible payment method promptly or your Super+ Membership will be canceled effective immediately. Super.com is not responsible for any fees charged by the cardholder's bank including, but not limited to, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, interest charges, foreign exchange fees, cross border fees, and other penalties levied by the cardholder's bank. If you provide us with a new eligible payment method and are successfully charged, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
Cancellation
You may cancel your Super+ Membership any time by calling our Customer Support team at 1 (844) 461-2577. You can also find this information on the Site or the Super.com App if you visit “My Account”. Additionally, if you are a resident of California or New York you may cancel your membership by visiting “My Account” and selecting “Cancel my membership”. If you would like to cancel your Super+ Membership, in order to not be charged on your upcoming billing date as indicated in your “My Account” page on the Super.com App, you must notify Super.com at least three (3) business days before the applicable billing date. If we do not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled billing date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so, and the cancellation will apply for the following billing cycle. All payments are non-refundable and non-transferable, and will not be refunded on a pro-rata basis for any cancellation. In the event of the termination of a Super+ Membership, including free trials or promotional memberships, all associated benefits shall terminate immediately. However, any earned Super+ credits shall be retained.
Limitation of Liability
IN ADDITION TO OTHER LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THESE TERMS OF USE, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE LAST MEMBERSHIP FEE YOU PAID. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND WILL SURVIVE CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP.
REFERRAL PROGRAM
We may offer users the opportunity to participate in programs rewarding users for referring their friends and family members to Super.com (each a “Referral Program”).
‍
We may provide you the opportunity to receive a promotional reward (“Reward”) for taking specific actions, like referring a friend to Super.com. Rewards may be issued as Promotional Credit to your User Account, or by other means we select from time to time. In order to earn Rewards through referrals, you will need to follow the instructions specific to that rewards program. Typically, we will provide you with a unique referral code to share with friends and family that they must enter when they sign up for a User Account or use a particular Service. The amount of Rewards you might earn for a referral, and the amount of cash (if any) for which a Reward may be redeemed, may vary from time to time in our sole discretion. We may offer temporary promotions pursuant to which you may earn a certain amount of Rewards for referrals made during the specified promotional period, and these promotions may be subject to additional terms and conditions that you are required to accept and that are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference. Unless otherwise specified by the terms of a promotion, you may only earn one Reward per User Account opened by a friend you referred to, even if you referred two or more friends who each become owners of the same User Account. You may not earn any Rewards if your User Account is past due, canceled, has a returned payment outstanding, or is otherwise in default. Rewards are issued solely for loyalty, awards, and promotional purposes. You may not use your Rewards for a business or commercial purpose. Rewards have no cash value until and unless Super.com credits your User Account. Rewards are not your property and you cannot transfer Rewards to any other person. Rewards cannot be transferred by operation of law. Rewards remain the property of Super.com until Super.com credits them to your User Account. Super.com reserves the right to decline to credit your User Account for Rewards earned at any time and for any reason, subject to applicable law. If we, in our sole discretion, determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or fraud in connection with earning Rewards or that you attempt to do so, we may take any action, including: (i) revoking any Rewards; (ii) temporarily suspending your ability to earn Rewards or receive a credit for Rewards previously earned; (iii) terminating your participation in the Rewards Program; and/or (iv) canceling your User Account.
‍
We may add to, terminate, and/or change the Referral Program at any time with or without notice to you. You acknowledge that in the event we make these changes, you may no longer be able to earn Rewards. If you or we close your User Account for any reason, we may immediately require you to forfeit all of your ability to earn Rewards. There is no fee to participate in the Referral Program. You are responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes as a result of earning Rewards.
CARD LINKED OFFERS
If you register a payment card in connection with any of the Services, Super.com will collect and/or receive data from third parties relating to transactions with the registered payment card. Transaction data may include limited redemption information for cardholder’s qualifying purchase, such as cardholder ID and associated transaction date/time, transaction amount, and merchant ID. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in other terms or privacy policies, transaction data may be used to monitor transactions on your registered payment card(s) to identify qualifying purchases, determine program eligibility, and operate and analyze the effectiveness of the card link program. Specifically when you register and link a payment card, Mastercard may: (1) monitor activity on your linked payment card(s) to identify qualifying transactions, and may share such transaction details with Super.com to enable your card linked offer(s) and otherwise facilitate your participation in Super.com's program, as set forth in Service Terms and Privacy Policy; and (2) may retrieve and analyze up to thirteen (13) months of prior transaction data history for your enrolled card for the purpose of targeting and assigning marketing offers to you. You may opt-out of transaction monitoring or the program on the payment card(s) you entered at any time through the Site or the Super.com App or by contacting our Customer Advocates. In certain circumstances, we reserve the right to initiate a clawback of cashback granted to users for specific offers previously opted into and for which cashback has already been received.

How Personal Data is Shared
Super.com shares your personal data securely with some third-party partners, hotels, payment processing companies, shipping companies, data analysis companies, partners providing direct services to you on our behalf and fraud prevention services. By using the Super.com Services you are agreeing that we may share some of your personal data with third parties, including our partners. The use of shared data is subject to the applicable third party’s privacy policy. For example, we share the personal information you enter on the travel booking form with hotels and hotel suppliers to make your reservations, and we provide certain personal information to third parties in connection with the Super+ Membership  Services, including personal information provided to our Partner Bank and other third parties in connection with the Super.com Financial Products and Earnings Services. We also provide certain personal information to third parties who provide advertising services on our sites so that the advertisements you see are personalized and relevant to you. We encourage all users to review hotel, Partner Bank, and other third party privacy policies to understand how their data is being handled once shared. Other third-party partners that we work with include payment/credit card processing, fraud prevention, know your customer and anti-money laundering evaluators, business and product analytics, rewards and cashback service providers, and customer service support. These partners are only given the specific personal data that they require, and nothing else.

.
Personal Data Choices You Have
The personal data that we collect is yours, and so you have choices available to you around what we collect and how it is used. Some of these choices can be communicated to Super.com (such as requesting access to or deletion of your information), and others should be communicated to other parties you engage with (such as in your phone settings for whether or not you share location information, etc.).
‍
You can always choose not to provide personal information such as your name, phone number, shipping address, email address, payment details, etc. However, this may mean that you are unable to complete a hotel booking or purchase products.
‍
Managing Your Information
You may access and update some of your information through your Account settings. If your account is tied to a third-party application, like Facebook or WhatsApp, you can change your settings and remove permission for the app on the third party’s website. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date.
‍
Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information
‍
You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information about you.
‍
Data Access and Portability
‍
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request certain copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
‍
Data Retention and Erasure
‍
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. In certain jurisdictions, you can request to have all your personal information deleted entirely. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
‍
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a Super.com User Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that User Account to prevent that person from opening a new account in the future.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Super.com may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
We may retain some copies of your information (e.g., log records) in our database, but they will be disassociated from personal identifiers.
Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing
If we are processing your personal information based on your consent you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your User Account settings or by sending a communication to Super.com specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant (under Objection to Processing) and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Super.com override your own.
‍
Objection to Processing
‍
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Super.com not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interests. If you object to such processing, Super.com will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
‍
Filing a Request
‍
To request access to, correction of, restriction of, or deletion of any of your personal data and information that we have collected, you can contact us at

Super+ Membership Service Terms
Last Updated: January 7, 2025
IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ THESE TERMS
These Service Terms (these “
Service Terms
”) for the Super+ membership services (“
Super+ Membership
” and, each individual with a Super+ Membership, a “
Super+ Member
”) are between you and Snapcommerce Holdings, Inc. DBA Super.com and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates (“
Super.com,
” “
we
,” and “
our
”). These Service Terms  govern your and our respective rights and obligations. Please note that your use of the Super.com website (the “
Site
”), the Super.com mobile app (the “
Super.com App
”), and Super+ Membership services are also governed by the Super.com Terms of Use (the “
Terms of Use
”), as well as the Service Terms for any specific products and services used in connection with your Super+ Membership, including, without limitation, the Super.com Privacy Policy, the Service Terms and any related agreements relating to the Super.com Travel Services, the Super.com Financial Services (i.e., the Super.com Deposit Account and Super.com Card), and the Super.com Earnings Services (collectively, the “
Additional Terms
”). The Terms of Use and the Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into these Service Terms. If you sign up for a Super+ Membership, you accept these Service Terms, as well as all other terms, conditions, limitations and requirements set forth on our Site or the Super.com Mobile App.
THE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS WELL AS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION, WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST SUPER.COM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW AND WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. READ CAREFULLY, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT, IF APPLICABLE, TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND THAT YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY IN ANY FORUM, AS DESCRIBED IN THE TERMS OF USE.
We may modify these Service Terms for any reason and at any time by posting a new version. Modifications to these Service Terms do not affect any rights or obligations that arose prior to the modifications, but your continued use of the Super+ Membership following the posting of modified Service Terms will be subject to the Service Terms in effect at the time of your use.
Please review these Service Terms periodically for changes.
If you object to any provision of these Service Terms or any subsequent modifications to these Service Terms your only recourse is to immediately terminate use of the Super+ Membership.
Membership Cancellation
You may cancel your Super+ Membership any time by calling our Customer Support team at
1
(877) 376-2710
. You can also find this information on the Site or the Super.com App if you visit “My Account”. Additionally, if you are a resident of California or New York you may cancel your membership by visiting “My Account” and selecting “Cancel my membership”. If you would like to cancel your Super+ Membership, in order to not be charged on your upcoming billing date as indicated in your “My Account” page on the Super.com App, you must notify Super.com at least three (3) business days before the applicable billing date. If we do not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled billing date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so, and the cancellation will apply for the following billing cycle. All payments are non-refundable and non-transferable, and will not be refunded on a pro-rata basis for any cancellation.
In the event of the termination of a Super+ Membership, including free trials or promotional memberships, all associated benefits shall terminate immediately.
Membership Fees, Payment, and Renewal
Fees
Your Super+ Membership fee (your “
Membership Fee
”) is stated in the “My Account” section of the Super.com App. The current Super+ Membership Fee is $15 per month. From time to time, we may change the Membership Fee and/or offer different membership terms. The Super+ Membership fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Service Terms.
Renewal
UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE SERVICE TERMS, YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY (BY DEFAULT AND WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) RENEW FOR THE AGREED UPON MONTHLY OR ANNUAL TERM, AND THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOU AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL TO YOUR LINKED PAYMENT METHOD. UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR NOT AUTO RENEW BASED ON THE PROCESS IN THE MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION SECTION, YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY LINKED PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.
Payment
Your Super+ Membership Fee will be automatically charged to your linked payment method in USD currency. If all linked payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment for your Super+ Membership Fee, Super.com may automatically retry your selected payment method to help you get back to enjoying the benefits of your membership, and/or may attempt to charge another payment method that we have on file. If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you continue to be declined, you must provide us a new eligible payment method promptly or your Super+ Membership will be canceled effective immediately. Super.com is not responsible for any fees charged by your bank in connection with our attempts to receive payment, including, without limitation, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, interest charges, foreign exchange fees, cross border fees, and other penalties levied by your bank. If you provide us with a new eligible payment method and are successfully charged, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
Billing Cycle
Super+ Membership Fees are payable monthly or annually in advance. When you purchase your Super+ Membership, you'll be charged the Membership Fee for your first billing cycle on the date of purchase, which activates the monthly or annual renewable Super+ Membership. Unless you cancel, you'll be charged based on the billing date and billing cycle indicated on your “My Account” page when logged into the Site or in the Super.com App. In certain circumstances, your billing date may change; for instance, if we are unable to successfully charge your card for the Super+ Membership fee on a given day (e.g., a Federal holiday or technical failures). Super.com may change the monthly or annual fee charged for membership at any time, but any such fee change will not apply to current Super+ Members until such time as their current memberships expire and their memberships are renewed for another term. Where the fee has increased, Super.com will notify you of the relevant fee increase prior to the renewal of your Super+ Membership.
Membership Credit
As a Super+ Member, you will earn Super+ credits (“
Super+ Credits
”
)
to a percentage of every dollar you spend on hotel booking purchases on Super.com, where Super.com is the merchant of record (“
MOR
”). The amount of Super+ Credits will be provided to you at the time of purchase. Super+ Credits shall be accrued and duly recorded in your Super+ Membership account on the later of the following dates: (1) forty-five (45) days from the date of hotel purchase or (2) the date of hotel check-in (“
Earned Date
”). Subject to our sole discretion, Super+ Credits may be granted at an earlier date in cases of promotional or limited offers.
Super+ Members may use Super+ Credits towards Super.com Travel bookings. Super.com must be the MOR for Super+ Credits to be applied toward a hotel booking at the time of purchase. Super+ Members with a Super.com Card (as defined below) can also redeem the Super+ Credits to their Super.com Deposit Account (as defined below), where they can be used towards everyday purchases on the Super.com Card.
PLEASE NOTE: Super+ Credits are rounded up to the nearest penny when the credits amount has a fractional cent at or above five/tenths ($0.005) and down to the nearest penny when below this amount. For example, if the amount of Super+ Credits calculated for a purchase was $3.2549, the Super+ Credits earned would be $3.25. However, if the amount of Super+ Credits calculated for a purchase was $3.2550, the Super+ Credits earned would be $3.26.
If you cancel a reservation made using Super+ Credits within the hotel supplier’s cancellation window, we will return the Super+ Credits to your account within 24 hours of your cancellation. If you cancel a reservation made using Super+ Credits outside of the hotel supplier’s cancellation window, the Super+ Credits will not be returned to your account.
There is a $100 daily, $250 weekly, and $1,000 monthly Super+ Credits redemption limit, when you redeem your Super+ Credits into your Super.com Account. Credits earned by Super+ Members generally expire 12 months after the Earned Date. However, some promotional or other credits may have varying expiration dates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Service Terms, the expiration date of Super+ Credits stated at the time they are offered or earned will control. In order to use them, you must redeem Super+ Credits within 12 months or the stated time period. If you do not redeem your Super+ Credits during their applicable period, your Super+ Credits will expire and will not be reissued.
Other Terms & Limitations
Super+ Credits cannot be used as a form of payment for your Super+ Membership Fee, and no Super+ Credits will be earned for the payment of the Super+ Membership Fee.
Super+ Credits have no cash value, and, except as expressly provided herein, cannot be redeemed for cash, other reward programs, or credits in another currency.
Super+ Credits may be earned and redeemed on transactions made in any currency of payment, but cashback shall be disbursed in the form of USD.
Super+ Credits are non-transferable.
Membership Benefits
The following is a description of Super+ Membership benefits, which are subject to change from time to time at our sole discretion.
Super.com Financial Services
One of the financial products/services offered via our Site or the Super.com App is the Super.com Secured Credit Card (the “
Super.com Card
”) connected to the Super.com demand deposit account (the “
Super.com Deposit Account
”). The Super.com Card and Super.com Deposit Account are offered by our bank partner, Republic Bank & Trust Company or its successor (“
Bank Partner
”), and are governed by and described in more detail in the following additional terms: Super.com Financial Services Service Terms, the Deposit Account Agreement, the Super.com Secured Charge Card Agreement, the Super.com Cashback Addendum, the Super.com Card Digital Wallet Terms of Use, the Super.com Deposit Account and Secured Credit Card Consent to Electronic Communications, and the Republic Bank & Trust Company Privacy Policy. You understand that the Bank Partner has sole discretion to approve or deny your application for a Super.com Deposit Account or Super.com Card for any reason, subject to applicable law.
Access to the Super.com Card is subject to (1) Super.com Deposit Account creation and (2) passing the Super.com Card identification and verification check described in the Super.com Financial Services Service Terms. If you do not pass the identification and verification check, you will maintain access to your Super+ Membership and benefits; however, you will not have use of the Super.com Card and related benefits. If you are approved for a Super.com Deposit Account, Bank Partner may limit or deny (or instruct us to limit or deny) your access to your Super.com Deposit Account and the related services for any reason, subject to applicable law.
If you have access to the Super.com Card, you will receive applicable cashback subject to the Super.com Cashback Addendum, except that no cashback will be earned if your Super+ Membership Fee is past due. Cashback percentages are subject to variation, and the percentages offered at the time of subscription purchase shall be the percentage awarded to you. Upon activation of the Super.com Card, the cashback benefit is contingent upon your use of the Super.com Card for purchases. In the event of any conflict between the Super.com Cashback Addendum and information provided in this section, the Super.com Cashback Addendum will control.
Supplementary Cash Advance
Republic Bank and Trust Company is not affiliated with this Service.
In connection with your Super+ Membership, Super.com offers a supplementary cash advance service (“
Supplementary Advance
”). There is no guarantee that you will qualify for a Supplementary Advance. Whether you qualify for a Supplementary Advance and for what amount is determined by a series of factors that may include, among other things, whether you have established a direct deposit into your Super.com Account or linked your Super.com Account to an external bank account or debit card (your “
Payment Method
”), and an analysis of your deposits and transaction history. We reserve the right to adjust Supplementary Advance amounts and our eligibility criteria at any time. Supplementary Advances are not loans, and we do not charge interest for Supplementary Advances, nor do we report repayment (or the failure to repay) or the timing of repayment to any credit bureau.
You may request a Supplementary Advance through our Site or on the Super.com App. You must have a Super.com User Account to request a Supplementary Advance. You may choose to provide tips or other gratuities in appreciation of Supplementary Advances (each a “
Gratuity
”). Options for Gratuities and any other optional fee which may be associated with a Supplementary Advance (collectively “
Voluntary Fees
”) will be presented to you prior to completing a request for a Supplementary Advance. Voluntary Fees are payable on the repayment date for the applicable Supplementary Advance (each a “
Repayment Date
”). In no way does your choice of Voluntary Fees alter your eligibility to receive a Supplementary Advance or the amount of any Supplementary Advance you are eligible to receive.
Our default is to automatically debit your Payment Method on your Repayment Date in an amount equal to the given Supplementary Advance and any associated Voluntary Fees. Super.com has no legal or contractual claim against you for failing to repay a Supplementary Advance, but Super.com will not provide you further Supplementary Advances (i) while any amount of a Supplementary Advance, including any Voluntary Fees associated with such Supplementary Advance, remains unpaid, (ii) if you have a history of late repayment of Supplementary Advances, or (iii) if you otherwise become ineligible for Supplementary Advances under our then-current eligibility criteria. With respect to a failure to repay a Supplementary Advance, Super.com will not engage in any debt collection activities, place the amount owed with or sell to a third party, or report you to a consumer reporting agency. Super.com does not waive any rights regarding fraudulent activity, and Super.com will pursue instances of fraud. Voluntary Fees paid are not refundable.
You may opt-out of our automatic debit of your Payment Method for a given Supplementary Advance by indicating so to a Super.com customer service representative at 1 (877) 376-2710 at least three (3) business days before the applicable Repayment Date.
If you do not have adequate funds in your Payment Method on the applicable Repayment Date and have not opted out of automatic repayment for a Supplementary Advance, we will continue to debit your Payment Method for that Supplementary Advance until it has been repaid.
We are not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, insufficient fund charges, or any other bank fees that result from your failure to maintain a sufficient balance on your Payment Method. We will monitor your balances where possible and attempt to ensure you have sufficient funds before debiting them, but we make no warranties that an overdraft of your Payment Method will not occur when you have inadequate funds to repay a Supplementary Advance on its Repayment Date.
‍
You authorize us to electronically debit your Payment Method on the Repayment Date for the Payment Amount in connection with each and every Supplementary Advance and all Voluntary Fees. As applicable, you also authorize Super.com to electronically debit and credit your Payment Method to correct erroneous debits and credits. You acknowledge that, as applicable, the electronic authorization contained in this section represents your written authorization for automated clearinghouse and debit card transactions as provided herein and will remain in full force and effect until you notify Super.com that you wish to revoke this authorization by indicating so to a Super.com customer service representative at
1 (877) 376-2710
. You must notify Super.com at least three (3) business days before the applicable Repayment Date in order to cancel this authorization for a given Supplementary Advance. When you call, please include the name and telephone number associated with your Super.com User Account. Failure to provide correct and complete information may make it impossible for Super.com to stop withdrawal of the preauthorized transaction.
‍
You agree to indemnify and hold Super.com harmless from and against any loss incurred as a result of its withdrawal of a preauthorized debit transaction from your Payment Method if any of the information relied upon in your request to stop payment is incorrect or incomplete. If you have followed the instructions in this section to notify Super.com of your desire to revoke your authorization at least three (3) business days before the Repayment Date, Super.com will be liable for your losses or damages directly caused by our failure to stop any preauthorized transaction. If we do not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled Repayment Date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so. You warrant and represent to Super.com that you have the right to authorize us to charge and credit your Payment Method for payments due to us in connection with a Supplementary Advance.
‍
If you have a Payment Method that is a joint account, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to (a) bind the absent account holder; and (b) enter into this Agreement independently. You agree to indemnify and hold Super.com harmless from any claims by any other owner of the Payment Method. You further acknowledge and agree that you are subject to the Consent to Electronic Communications disclosures in the Terms of Use as well as the Super.com Deposit Account and Secured Credit Card Consent to Electronic Communications.

Only one trial or promotional membership is available per household and may not be combined with any other promotion.
YOU AGREE THAT AT THE END OF YOUR APPLICABLE FREE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL MEMBERSHIP PERIOD, YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE MEMBERSHIP FEE STATED IN YOUR OFFER AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL MEMBERSHIP BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION PROCEDURE DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ADDITIONAL TERMS - HOTEL BOOKINGS
SUPPLIER RULES AND RESTRICTIONS
Super.com works with several hotel suppliers. When a hotel room is reserved through the Travel Services with a hotel supplier, the terms and conditions of that particular hotel supplier will also apply to your reservation. Without limitation, when the hotel supplier is Travelscape LLC or Vacationspot, SL - you are bound to additional terms and conditions located at
http://developer.ean.com/terms/en/
.
If you violate any part of the hotel suppliers’ terms and conditions, we have the right to cancel your reservation and to make changes accordingly. You will be responsible for all fees that arise from making such changes should it be applicable. If you have used credits towards such a reservation, the credits will be forfeited and not returned to your account.
You acknowledge that some hotel suppliers may require you to agree to and sign their additional terms and conditions (including a liability waiver) prior to your stay at the hotel property or otherwise participating in the hotel services they offer. You understand that any violation of any such hotel supplier’s additional terms and conditions may result in cancellation of your reservation, you being denied access to the hotel property and/or other services, you forfeit any monies paid in connection with your reservation, and/or your Super.com User Account being debited for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.
‍
PRICES
The prices for the hotel services will be as quoted on the Travel Services from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect reservations already accepted. Despite our best efforts, some of the hotel services listed on the Travel Services may be incorrectly priced. We reserve the right to correct any pricing errors on the Travel Services and in such an event, we may (if available and at our discretion) cancel the reservation or offer you the opportunity to keep your pending reservation at the correct price.
We also reserve the right to cancel, to terminate or not to process reservations (including accepted reservations) where the price or other material information on the Travel Services is inaccurate. We are under no obligation to fulfill orders placed at an incorrect (lower) price, even after you have been sent confirmation of your order.
The price quoted on the Travel Services may include, where applicable, fees, tax recovery charges and taxes on Super.com’s services. Except with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, Super.com does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel reservations are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that Super.com pays to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room.
The hotel suppliers invoice Super.com for certain charges, including tax amounts, and are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by Super.com to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability and other related factors in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers.
In addition, your statement may include a transaction fee charged by your card issuer to process the transaction. We are not associated with these additional fees and will not be held liable for any fees relating to the transaction.
Fees for any additional services you elect or tips you pay post booking are non-refundable except as otherwise stated at the time such fees are charged or collected.
‍
PREPAID OR PAY AT HOTEL
You acknowledge that some reservations require prepayment, and some reservations can be paid later at the hotel property. If you select a prepaid reservation, you will be charged the full amount for the reservation immediately following the submission and acceptance of your reservation. Where you are using Program credits for your reservation (in whole or in part), your account will be debited the applicable credits immediately following the submission and acceptance of your reservation. Program credits may only be applied for prepaid reservations.
If you select a pay later rate, you will pay the hotel supplier upon arrival in their preferred currency for the full amount. You understand that tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between making your reservation and your stay at the hotel property, which means the amount you will pay the hotel supplier may differ from the amount reflected in your reservation.
Transaction fees may apply when making a reservation for a hotel property in a foreign country or in a foreign currency. These fees will be applied to the cardholder’s account by the card issuing bank, independent from Super.com. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rates applied to your order, please contact your credit card issuer.
‍
PROMOTIONS, DISCOUNTS, & CREDITS
Promotions, discounts, or credits will be applicable exclusively for bookings made on Super.com’s website and only when reserving accommodations where Super.com functions as the merchant of record.
‍
SPECIAL REQUESTS
We will do our best to pass on your special requests to the hotel supplier - but we cannot guarantee that the hotel supplier will be able to honor any special requests that you make. You must contact the hotel supplier directly to confirm the availability of any extra items or special requests. It is also your responsibility to verify that the hotel supplier can satisfy any special needs (such as accessibility features) that you may have.
‍
HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS
We act solely as an intermediary between you and the hotel for the purpose of facilitating hotel accommodation bookings. We do not own, operate, or control the hotels or their services. Therefore, we disclaim any responsibility for the state, quality, condition, or suitability of the hotel, hotel room, or hotel service provided to you. We may provide information about third-party services, such as hotels and their amenities, through our platform. However, we do not endorse or warrant the accuracy, reliability, or suitability of such information. You are advised to conduct your own research and due diligence before making any booking decisions.
In the event the hotel accommodation, hotel room, or hotel service fails to meet your expectations or satisfaction, we shall not be liable for any refunds, exchanges, compensation, or reimbursement. Any disputes or issues related to the hotel accommodations must be resolved directly between you and the hotel. We shall have no obligation to mediate or participate in such disputes.
‍
DATA-BACKED CLAIMS AND RELIANCE
We acknowledge that data-backed claims are based on available information and sources that are deemed reliable. However, we do not guarantee the absolute accuracy, completeness, or up-to-dateness of such claims. You understand and agree that any decisions or actions taken based on data-backed claims provided by us are at your own risk. We shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from the use of such claims, including but not limited to financial losses, business interruptions, or reputational harm. You are encouraged to independently verify any data-backed claims provided by us before making critical decisions. We shall not be responsible for any adverse outcomes resulting from the User's reliance solely on these claims without conducting appropriate due diligence.
‍
UNIFIED CREDITS
If you have a Super+ Membership and a Super.com Card, when you receive credits from
booking a hotel or flight on Super.com
, you will be able to use those credits across our two verticals, Financial Products & Earnings and Travel. This means that if you receive credits from Travel Services, these can be redeemed to your Super.com Deposit Account, where you can use it towards your everyday purchases on your Super.com Card anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Additionally, if you receive cash rewards from your Super.com Card these can be applied as credits to your hotel or flight bookings through the Travel Services. Please note there is a $100 daily, $250 weekly, and $1000 monthly redemption limit so you may not have access to your full cash rewards if you choose to redeem your credits or cash rewards into your Super.com Card. Additionally, unless stated otherwise, unredeemed credits remain available for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance.
‍
CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS
You can cancel your reservation on your email confirmation or by using our automated chat if you made the booking over text/chat via the Travel Services. However, cancellation fees may apply in accordance with the reservation terms and conditions. Each booking will have its own unique cancellation policy which can be found on the final booking step as well as in the confirmation email. If the policy is non-refundable, that means the booking is final sale and will not result in a refund if canceled.
You agree to pay any required cancellation fees when you confirm the booking. You also agree to pay any required change fees to modify your booking. Changes to your booking are not guaranteed and are subject to approval by hotel suppliers. Super.com is not liable for any rejected changes to a hotel booking and reserves the right to charge the modification fee regardless.
We are not responsible for the acts or omissions of any supplier or service provider. If a supplier or service provider is unable to honor your reservation, Super.com will not be liable for any costs incurred due to relocation. If you do not show for the initial part of your reservation but plan to check-in for subsequent dates in the reservation, you must confirm the reservation with Super.com no later than the original date of check-in to prevent cancellation of the whole booking. If you do not confirm the booking changes with Super.com the whole booking may be canceled and refunds will only be due to you in line with the cancellation policy of the particular property, as notified in the booking process.
‍
‍
LIMITED BOOKINGS GUARANTEE
‍
In the rare case that you are unable to check into a hotel with your Super.com reservation, we may provide you a full or partial refund ("
Limited Booking Guarantee
"). In addition to any specific terms set forth at the time the applicable reservation is offered, the following shall also apply:
For a Limited Booking Guarantee to apply you must contact Super.com immediately if you have difficulty checking in upon arrival. If you make your own arrangements without contacting Super.com you forfeit your rights to any Limited Booking Guarantee.
Limited Booking Guarantees do not apply in the following circumstances:
Where customer is at fault, including, without limitation, the following:
Making the reservation with a name that doesn’t match the ID presented at the hotel;
Not being over 18;
Failure to arrive at the hotel on time or at all;
Changing the check-in date, room type, or other reservation details without confirmation from Super.com;
Refusal to provide authorization for security and incidentals at check-in;

Any payment failure (prepaid bookings only).
Where a booking was made illegally, in bad faith or under circumstances with high security risks; including but not limited to bookings made maliciously by competitors, use of unverified payment methods or accounts, or any other circumstances deemed to constitute a security risk.
‍
CURRENCY CONVERTER AND FOREIGN TRAVEL
Currency rates are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as guidelines only. When paying in a different currency, the conversion rate is determined by your credit card issuing bank and Super.com can only provide you with an estimate. In addition, your statement may include a conversion or transaction fee (which may be in a foreign currency) charged by your card issuer to process the transaction. We are not associated with these additional fees and will not be held liable for any fees relating to varying exchange rates or card issuer fees.
Where your reservation is for a hotel property in a foreign jurisdiction, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that you have all necessary travel documents and that all foreign entry requirements are met. It is also your responsibility to make sure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip. We accept no liability if you are refused entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting through. By coordinating reservations for hotel services in international destinations, we do not make any representation or warranty that travel to such destinations are advisable or without risk. Super.com has no liability for any damages or losses that may result from your travel to any destination.
‍
TERMINATION
We may terminate your User Account and/or your use of the Travel Services as set forth in the Terms of Use. You agree that where we terminate or discontinue your access to a User Account or the Travel Services, you may lose all credits in your User Account and we will not be liable to you or any third party for any damages resulting from such termination.

The Card Account is a charge card that accesses a line of credit. It is not a debit card, and you do not access the money in your Deposit Account when you use your Card. All credit we extend to you is secured by your Deposit Account. If you do not pay us back for transactions you make with your Card Account when your payments are due, we may exercise our Security Interest and withdraw the amount you owe us from your Deposit Account. You can lose the money in your Deposit Account and your Card Account may be closed.
See the
Security Agreement

‍
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
‍
Using Your Card
The following rules apply to your use of your Card:
You must sign the Card when you receive it.
You must return the Card to us or destroy it if we ask you to.
You must take reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized use of your Card.
We are not responsible for any losses you incur if anyone refuses to accept your Card for any reason.
We may decline to authorize a transaction for any reason.
We are not responsible for any losses you incur if we do not authorize a transaction.
You must not use, or try to use, the Card for any illegal activity.
We are not liable for any losses that may result when our services are unavailable due to reasons beyond our control.
‍
Credit Limit and Available Credit
‍
Credit Limit
. We will assign a Credit Limit
to your Card Account. The Credit Limit will be based on your Deposit amount, but will not exceed $5,000. A Credit Limit is the maximum amount of credit we may extend to you when you use your Card Account. The total outstanding unpaid balance you owe on your Card Account (“Card Account Balance”) may never be greater than your Credit Limit. You are responsible for keeping track of your Card Account Balance. We may, at our discretion, refuse to extend credit for any reason including when pre-authorized charges or other holds might cause you to exceed your Credit Limit.
Available Credit
. Your Available Credit
is the amount of credit that is available for you to make transactions with your Card at any given time. Your Available Credit is equal to the Available Balance in your Deposit Account, minus the Spent Funds, up to your Credit Limit.
Rules
. You can use the Super App or contact customer service to view your Card Account Balance, Credit Limit, and Available Credit at any time. While we do our best to provide the most up-to-date information about your Card Account, there may be some delay in reflecting new transactions, for reasons outside our control such as network interruptions or delays by merchants in posting transactions and we cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information in the Super App or by phone. You are responsible for keeping track of your Card Account Balance, Credit Limit, and Available Credit. Our general practice is to decline transactions that may cause you to exceed your Credit Limit, Credit Limit or Available Credit. If we do honor these transactions, you are responsible for paying us back in full immediately, and these limits will not increase. We may increase or decrease your Credit Limit, Credit Limit, or Available Credit at any time, in our sole discretion. We are not required to extend credit up to your maximum Credit Limit, if it would cause you to exceed your Available Credit or your Credit Limit.
‍
‍
Using Your Card Account
Virtual Card.
We may permit you to obtain a virtual Card Account in the Super App or in a third-party wallet service and use the virtual Card Account to make transactions from time to time. Your use of a virtual Card Account is subject to additional terms and conditions which you must accept when you obtain or access a virtual Card Account. These additional terms and conditions are incorporated by reference herein. You may not be able to use a virtual Card Account at an ATM or any terminal that does not have the technology necessary to accept a virtual Card Account.
Point of Sale Purchases
. You may use your Card to make purchases at points-of-sale.
Cash Advances
. You may use your Card to obtain cash advances at ATMs. Obtaining a cash advance at an ATM is a loan and does not debit your Deposit Account. Interest, finance charges, and other fees may apply, as shown in the Truth in Lending Disclosure or any Fee Schedule we provide.
‍
Using a PIN
. We may give you a personal identification number (“PIN”) that you may use to make transactions on your Card. For security reasons, you may have to provide the PIN before you are able to use the Card. Keep your PIN secure. Do not write it down, give it to anyone, or keep it with your Card. If you lose your Card or believe the confidentiality of your PIN has been compromised for any reason, you must contact us immediately.
Rewards
. Your Card may provide you with the opportunity to earn rewards. If it does, we will separately provide you with information and terms about the rewards.
Responsibility for Card Use
. You are liable for all transactions made with your Card or Super Pay Account, and all related fees or expenses incurred, by you and any other person that you permit to use or have access to your Super Pay Account, Card, or any other Access Credential.
Lost or Stolen Card
. If your Card is lost or stolen or if you think someone else may be using your Super Pay Account, Card, or Access Credentials without your permission, you must contact us immediately at
support@super.com
.
‍
Interest and Fees:
Interest and Fees
. We will charge fees as disclosed in the
Truth in Lending Disclosures
on Pages 2 of this Agreement, subsequent disclosures, Statements, any change in terms notices, and in the
Fee Schedule
provided with this Agreement. If you miss a required payment, make a late payment, or a payment is returned and you fail to successfully make the required payment by the Due date [we may terminate Card Account.
Balance Computation Method
. To get the “average daily balance,” we take the beginning balance on the Card each day of the Cycle, add any new purchases, and/or fees, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us a daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the Cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance.”
Expedited Delivery Fee
. We impose a $25.00 fee for the expedited delivery of your Card.
Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies
. If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, the payment network will convert it into a U.S. dollar amount. The Mastercard will use its own currency conversion procedures. The conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date that appears on your Statement. We do not adjust the currency exchange rate or charge any currency conversion fees. Foreign transactions are subject to the Foreign Transaction Fee set forth in the Truth in Lending Disclosures.
ATM Fees
. We charge a fee if you use an out-of-network ATM. An out-of-network third-party operator of the ATM may charge a separate fee for your use of the ATM. This fee may be charged to your Card and access your line of credit. You are responsible for paying all such fees.
‍
‍
Payments
Your Promise to Pay
. You promise to pay us all amounts due on your Card Account by each Due date set forth on your Statement. This includes amounts where you did not sign a purchase slip or other documents for the transaction. We will treat transactions made without presenting a physical Card (such as for mail, telephone, Internet, or mobile device purchases) the same as if you used the Card in person. If you let someone else use your Super Pay Account, you are responsible for all transactions that person makes.
Minimum Payment
. Each billing cycle, you must pay us the payment amount listed on your Statement by the Due date. Failure to make the minimum payment subject to the default provisions herein.
Payment Methods
. Your payment must be made in U.S. dollars from a U.S. deposit account. You must use one of the following payment methods:
Preauthorized Automatic Payments (“AutoPay”)
. When you sign up, or by using the Super App, you may elect to make payments for your Card using AutoPay. Upon selecting AutoPay, you authorize us to make recurring debits from your respective Deposit Accounts or ACH transfers from Linked External Accounts, on each Due date, in the amount of the payment due (or another amount you select), as set forth on each Statement. You also authorize us to debit or credit your selected payment method as needed to correct any errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues, to the extent permitted by law.
One-Time Transfer
. You may use the Super App to authorize us to make a one-time transfer to us from your Deposit Account or ACH transfers from a Linked External Account on or before each Due date. You also authorize us to debit or credit your selected payment method to correct any errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues, to the extent permitted by law. We may permit additional payment methods from time to time. We may reject any payment not made in accordance with this section.
Effect of Payment on Credit Limit
. When we receive a payment and apply it to your Card Account from a payment method other than a transfer from your Deposit Account or digital wallet, your Credit Limit on your Card Account will increase in an amount equivalent to your payment. We may delay the change in your Credit Limit until we confirm that your payment has cleared. This may happen even if we credit your payment. If you have elected to make payments from the Deposit Account associated with your Card Account, your Deposit Account balance and your Spent Funds will be reduced by the amount of your payment, and your Credit Limit on the Card will not increase.
Payment Processing
. We may accept and process payments without losing any of our rights. If your payment is returned unpaid for any reason, you authorize us to re-initiate the payment you authorized up to two additional times. We also reserve the right to add the returned payment amount back to your Card Account.
How We Apply Your Payments
. Payments are first applied to any past-due amount, then to your current minimum payment due. We may adjust your Card Account Balance, Deposit Account balance, or Credit Limit as reasonably necessary to correct errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues.
Credit Balances
. We may reject and return any payment that creates or adds to a credit balance on your Card Account. Any credit balance we allow will not be available until we confirm that your payment has cleared. We may reduce the amount of any credit balance by any new charges. You may write to the address provided on your Monthly Billing Statement to request a refund of any available credit balance.
Non-Payment. In addition to any other rights we may have or actions we may take under this Agreement, if you fail to pay your outstanding balance on the Due date, we may exercise the Security Interest in the Collateral under the Security Agreement.

Military Lending Act Disclosure
: The Military Lending Act provides protections for Covered Borrowers, as defined in at 32 C.F.R. § 232.3(g). The following provisions of this Military Lending Act Disclosure section apply to Covered Borrowers. If you would like more information about whether you are a Covered Borrower, you may contact us at 1 (866) 602-3983.
Military Lending Act Notice: Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependents may not exceed an Annual Percentage Rate of 36%. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: (i) the costs associated with credit insurance premiums; (ii) fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; (iii) any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and (iv) any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account).
Oral Disclosures: In order to hear these important disclosures related to the Military Lending Act, you may call 1 (866) 602-3983.
Applicability of Binding Arbitration: The Binding Arbitration section of this Agreement does not apply to Covered Borrowers.
‍
Credit Limit
. You may not spend more than the amount you have in your Deposit Account with your Card or with transactions on your Deposit Account. We refer to this limit as the Credit Limit. The Spent Funds
is a portion of the Available Balance in your Deposit Account in an amount equal to your total Card Account Balance. The Credit Limit on your Deposit Account may never exceed the Credit Limit or the Available Credit. If you make a transaction that causes you to exceed the Credit Limit on your Card Account, you agree to immediately make a payment on your Card or make a deposit to your Deposit Account such that you no longer exceed your Credit Limit. Our general practice is to decline any transaction that would cause you to exceed any applicable Credit Limit. Even if we have permitted you to exceed your Credit Limit before, we are not required to do it in the future. We may determine the amount of Available Balance, Spent Funds, and Card Account Balance for the purpose of deciding whether a transaction will cause you to exceed a Credit Limit only once, and at any time between the time you authorize the transaction and when we decline the transaction or send a notice of the declined transaction.
The Super App
. You can access your Card Account through the Super mobile application (Super App). You may log in to the Super App at any time to view and update information about your Card Account and initiate online transactions. Your use of the Super App is subject to the Super Pay Service Terms.
Other Transaction Limits
. For security reasons, there are limits on the number, amount, frequency, and type of transactions you can make using your Card or Super Pay Account. Similarly, there are limits on your ability to use your Card with certain merchants or terminals. To protect the security of your Super Pay Account, others’ accounts and systems, we may or may not disclose some or all of these limits and any changes to these limits, unless required by law. We may change these limits from time to time at our sole discretion. We will notify you of any limits or changes to these limits if required by applicable law. In our discretion, we may permit you to make transactions in excess of these limits, but our permission to do so on one occasion does not guarantee that we will allow a transaction in excess of the limits in the future. Your rights under this Agreement to make purchases, deposit funds, make ATM transactions, transfers, and other transactions with your Card or Super Pay Account are subject to this paragraph.
‍
Security; Locking Your Card Account
. CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR Card Account OR Card HAS BEEN LOST, STOLEN, OR ACCESSED OR USED BY ANY UNAUTHORIZED PERSON. You may ask us to lock any Card, and we may take other action we deem necessary to protect the security of your Super Pay Account or our systems. Locking a Card Account may not prevent all unauthorized transactions and will not prevent transactions that have already been initiated.
Governing Law.
This Agreement and your Card Account, and any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) at any time arising from or relating to your Card Account, this Agreement or any transferred balances, are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, by the laws of Missouri (without regard to internal principles of conflict of laws).
Communication with You.
We may contact you from time to time regarding your Card Account. We (and our affiliates, agents and contractors) may contact you in any manner we choose to the extent allowed by applicable law. For example, we may contact you:
(1) by mail, telephone, email, or text message;
(2) by using an automated dialing or similar device (“autodialer”);
(3) at your home and at your place of employment;
(4) on your mobile, wireless or cellular telephone or similar device, which may result in charges to you;

(6) with any frequency;
(7) by leaving prerecorded and other messages on your answering machine/service and with others; and
(8) by identifying ourselves, your relationship with us and our purpose for contacting you even if others might hear or read it.
‍
We may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you. Unless the law states we cannot, we may modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose. You also agree that we may contact you using phone numbers, addresses and email addresses we obtain from public and nonpublic databases we may lawfully access; provided, that we will only do so in compliance with applicable law. Where allowed by law, we also may contact other individuals who may be able to provide updated employment, location, and contact information for you. Some of the legal purposes for calls and messages include: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; transactions on or servicing of your Card Account; collecting on your Card Account; and providing you information about certain products, services and promotions.
Amendment or Modification.
At any time and subject to applicable law, we may change or delete any term of, or add new terms to, this Agreement, including without limitation the Interest Charge, Annual Percentage Rate, Fees, Total Minimum Payment Due amount, and the Arbitration Provision. Unless prohibited by applicable law, these changed or new terms will apply to any Card Account balance outstanding on the effective date of the change and to all future balances. When required by applicable law, we will notify you in advance of any changes, deletions or additions. Our notice will tell you when and how the changes will take effect and describe any rights you have in connection with the changes.

or electronically. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
‍
‍
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
Within 30 days of receiving your notice, we must tell you that we received your notice. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
Within 90 days of receiving your notice, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
The charge in question may remain on your monthly billing statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
If we made a mistake:
You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
If we do not believe there was a mistake:
You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
‍
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
‍
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
‍
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases
.
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these is necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
You must have used your Card Account for the purchase. Purchases made with cash withdrawals from an ATM do not qualify.
You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us
in writing
or electronically at:
‍
MRV Banks c/o Super Pay
18 Bartol Street, Unit #159
San Francisco, CA 94133
You may also contact us on the Web at
support@super.com
‍
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.
‍
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
‍
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
‍
Agreement to Arbitrate
‍
This section is referred to as the
Arbitration Agreement
. If you have a dispute with the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, and are not able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process set forth in this section.
‍
Arbitration
‍
You agree that if you have a dispute or claim that has arisen or may arise between you and the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach), your Super Pay Account and services provided under this Agreement, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, and you are not able to resolve the dispute or claim informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute or claim will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and the Bank are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
‍
‍
Parties Subject to this Arbitration Agreement
This Arbitration Agreement applies whenever there is a claim between you and us. If a third party, such as an Indemnified Party other than the Bank, is also involved in a claim between you and us, or if a dispute arises between you and an Indemnified Party other than the Bank relating to this Agreement or your Super Pay Account, then the claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party.
‍
‍
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A COVERED BORROWER UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE COVERED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT, IN WHICH CASE THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, PLEASE CONTACT US AT
support@super.com
.
‍
Exclusions
You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so failing will bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration.
‍
Your Right to Opt Out
If you do not want this Arbitration Agreement to apply to your Super Pay Account, you may opt out by sending us written notice of your decision within 30 days of the opening of your Super Pay Account. Such notice must clearly state that you wish to cancel or opt out of the Arbitration Agreement section of this Agreement. It should include your name, address, Super Pay Account number, and your signature and must be and must be emailed to
optout@livesuper.com
. This is the sole and only method by which you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Your exercise of the right to opt-out will not affect any remaining terms of this Agreement and will not result in any adverse consequence to you or your Super Pay Account. You agree that our business records will be final and conclusive evidence with respect to whether you canceled or opted out of this Arbitration Agreement in a timely and proper fashion.
‍
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE BANK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
‍
‍
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at
support@super.com
. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (
Notice
). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (
Notice Address
). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within 60 calendar days after the Notice is received, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank is entitled.
‍
‍
Arbitration Procedures
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (
AAA
) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the
AAA Rules
), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration
. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
‍
Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
‍
Costs of Arbitration
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
Arbitration Fees
) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, the Bank will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
‍
‍
Confidentiality
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
‍
Severability
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non
-
Individualized Relief
section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Super Pay Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).
‍
SECURITY AGREEMENT
‍
Our Security Interest in Your Deposit Account
. You hereby grant to us, as of the date you enter into this Agreement, a security interest in all right, title and interest in any Deposit Account you have with us, and all funds deposited therein, now owned or hereinafter acquired (collectively, the
Collateral
), to secure your performance under this Agreement, including your duty to pay us for all obligations you owe us under this Agreement, present or hereinafter occurring, when payments are due, for every transaction made with your Super Pay Account (
Security Interest
)
.
‍
‍
Our Right to Exercise the Security Interest
. You irrevocably and unconditionally relinquish possession and control over the Collateral, and you pledge and assign as security to us all of your right, title, and interest in it. You must take any action we request to perfect or protect our first lien position Security Interest in the Collateral. You waive the benefit of any homestead or other exemptions in the Collateral. The Security Interest will be governed by
Uniform Commercial Code - Article 9
(as adopted by the applicable state law) whether
Article 9
applies by its terms or not. We do not have to give you any prior notice to apply the funds in your Deposit Account or other Collateral or its proceeds to satisfy your obligations. You expressly agree that our rights under this Security Agreement extend to any electronically deposited federal or state benefit payments (including Social Security benefits) to the extent permitted by law. If you do not want your benefits applied in this way, you may change your direct deposit instructions at any time with the person or organization paying the benefits. In addition, you grant us a right of setoff to your Deposit Account to secure all amounts you owe us under this Agreement. This right of setoff does not apply to your Deposit Account if prohibited by law. You agree to hold us harmless from any claim arising as a result of our exercise of our right of setoff or Security Interest.
‍
‍
What Happens When You Spend Money
. When you make a transaction on a Card Account, an equivalent amount of funds in your Deposit Account will be classified as
Spent Funds
. The Spent Funds will remain in your Deposit Account. When you make a payment on your Card Account, an amount of the Spent Funds equal to the amount of the payment will no longer be classified as Spent Funds. You authorize us to limit your ability to withdraw or transfer all or part of the funds in your Deposit Account, up to the amount of funds classified as Spent Funds, as reasonably necessary to ensure that (1) your Card Account Balance and total of other transactions on your Deposit Account do not exceed the Available Balance in your Deposit Account at any given time; and (2) to preserve our rights under this Security Agreement.
‍
‍
YOU MAY LOSE FUNDS IN YOUR DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
. If you are in default of any obligation under this Agreement, or your Super App Account is closed for any reason, you authorize us to withdraw funds from your Deposit Account and apply such amounts to the outstanding Card Account Balance and any other amounts you owe us under this Agreement without sending you notice or demand for payment. We may do this in addition to the other rights we have under law or this Agreement. The application of your funds to the Card Account Balance and any other amounts you owe under this Agreement will not affect your obligation to pay us in full. You are responsible for the repayment of all amounts you owe us under this Agreement.
‍
‍
Legal Proceedings
. You represent that (a) there are no current lawsuits or bankruptcy proceedings that might affect our interest in your Deposit Account; and (b) you have not and will not attempt to transfer any interest in your Deposit Account to any other person or offer your Deposit Account as collateral or security for any other obligation. If any person seeks to attach your Deposit Account, for example by legal garnishment, you agree that we may deem all amounts you owe us, including any unpaid Card Account Balance, immediately payable and apply the funds in your Deposit Account as payment of those amounts. If we must hire an attorney to defend or enforce our rights under the Security Agreement, you will pay our reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs, unless prohibited by law.
‍
The application of Funds to your Card will not change your minimum payment amount. You are responsible for the repayment of any Obligation that is not satisﬁed by the application of Collateral. We may take up to 60 days to return any excess Collateral to you.
‍
If there is no activity with respect to your Account for a prescribed period of time (generally five (5) years), the Collateral may be presumed to have been abandoned and will escheat to and become the property of the State of Missouri or another applicable state. We will notify you if required by law prior to escheating any Collateral held under this Agreement.
‍
If you become a debtor in any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code, you agree that you will recognize us as a perfected secured creditor with respect to the Security Account and that you will declare the Funds held as a security deposit as exempt property pursuant to the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or applicable State exemption laws.
‍
We may amend the terms and conditions applicable to your Security Account separately from the remainder of this Agreement at any time with reasonable written notice to you if required by applicable law.
‍
No Warranties
. We are not responsible for any claim you may have regarding the purchase of goods or services made with your Card Account beyond your rights described in this section and on your Statement.
‍
Events of Default
. You will be in default if:
You fail to make any payment required under the terms of this Agreement when it is due;
Any required payment you make is rejected, not paid or cannot be processed;
You exceed your credit limit;
You file or become the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;
You are unable or unwilling to repay your obligations, including upon death or legally declared incapacity;
We determine that you made a false, incomplete or misleading statement to us, or you otherwise tried to defraud us;
You do not comply with any term of this Agreement or any other agreement with us;
You relocate outside the United States with a non-U.S. mailing address; or
We receive a garnishment, attachment or other levy upon your Deposit Account, or the Deposit Account is subject to any other legal proceeding.
If you are in default, we may take certain actions with respect to your Account. For example, depending on the default, we may take the following actions, without notifying you, unless the law says that we must give you notice:
(Close or suspend Card Account;
Reduce your credit limit;
Demand that you immediately pay the total balance owing on your Card Account;
Continue to charge you interest and fees (as set forth in the
Truth in Lending Disclosures
) as long as your Card Account Balance remains outstanding; and/or
File a lawsuit against you, or pursue another action that is not prohibited by law. If we file a lawsuit, you agree to pay our court costs, expenses and attorney fees, unless the law does not allow us to collect these amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your Account is 180 days past due, is part of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or is otherwise charged off, the total balance on your Account is immediately due and payable.

MRV Banks Account Agreement
GENERAL AGREEMENT
. You understand the following Digital Deposit Account Agreement ("Agreement") governs your account with us. Your account is also governed by other applicable documents, such as the Truth In Savings Account Disclosure and Privacy Policy, and where applicable, the Funds Availability Policy and Electronic Fund Transfer (Agreement and) Disclosure ("Disclosures"), which are incorporated by reference. By providing a written or electronic signature on the Account Information document or other agreement to open your account, or by using any of our deposit account services, you and any identified account owners agree to the terms contained in this Account Agreement.
DIGITAL DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TERMS.
This section governs your use of your Deposit Account.
Deposits
Limited Deposit Account Access
. Your Deposit Account is only accessible through the Super App on your mobile device. You may only make withdrawals and transactions from your Deposit Account by initiating permitted transactions on the Super App. You will not be able to make withdrawals or deposits on your Deposit Account at branch locations, by telephone, at the point of sale, or at ATMs.
You may not use your Card to debit your Deposit Account.
FDIC Insurance
. Funds in your Deposit Account are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (
FDIC
) through MRV Banks and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, up to the applicable limit. The amount of insurance coverage you have may depend on the balance in your Deposit Account and the ownership, type of, and balances held in any other accounts you have with us. For additional information, please visit the FDIC’s website at www.fdic.gov. You agree and acknowledge that your deposit may be aggregated with other deposits in one or more accounts of our choosing. However, in no event with the aggregate deposits exceed the FDIC insurance limits.
Deposit Requirements
. Deposits must be made in U.S. Dollars. Deposits made by ACH are subject to the
NACHA Operating Rules and Operating Guidelines
and the rules of any regional clearing houses we may use from time to time (collectively, the
ACH Rules
). Before final settlement of any deposit, we act only as your agent. We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items we accept for deposit (including items drawn “on us”). You authorize us to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in attempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond an applicable deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection in U.S. dollars. We will treat and record all transactions received after the Cutoff Time (defined below) on a Business Day we are open, or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next Business Day that we are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit.
Permitted Deposits
. Deposits to your Deposit Account may be made using one of the following payment methods:
External Debit Card
. You may use the Super App to authorize us to charge a debit card issued by an external U.S. bank and deposit the funds in your Deposit Account. You are responsible for any fees charged by the issuing bank for using your debit card.
Linked External Account
. You may authorize us to initiate ACH transfers from a Linked External Account to your Deposit Account. Use the Super App to set up, review, change or cancel your scheduled transfers.
Person-to-Person Transfer with Super.com Users
. You can receive transfers to your Deposit Account initiated by another Super.com user, using the person-to-person transfer services (
P2P Transfer
) provided in the Super App pursuant to Section IV.D below.
Cash Deposit at Retailer
. When and where available, you may load funds into your Deposit Account by tendering cash at a retailer participating in a network that supports Super Pay Accounts. When you present cash for deposit to a participating retailer you will use the Super App to present a barcode to a participating retailer. There are limits on the amount and frequency of deposits you may make using this method, and we reserve the right to make changes to such limits as needed. Security and fraud screenings may delay the availability of your deposit. If cash deposit is made available via the Super App and you make a cash deposit, you agree to the participating retailer’s Service Terms and Conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference. Cash deposits may only be made to your Super Pay Account by you. You understand and agree that cash transactions are not subject to certain consumer and fraud protections afforded to electronic transactions and fraudulent transactions or errors may result in a loss of your funds. You may find a participating retail location in the Super App. Subject to availability. Participating retail locations may change.
Direct Deposit
. You can direct a third party, such as an employer, to electronically deposit your paycheck, retirement benefits, or other income to your Deposit Account by ACH or wire transfer. Direct deposits may not be initiated in the Super App.
Mobile Check Deposit.
You may load funds into your Deposit Account by submitting an electronic image of a paper check (“Mobile Check”) using a “Mobile Check Deposit'' feature within the Super App, when available. You must provide all the requested permissions for the Super App to be able to capture images and to create and transmit the Mobile Check.
Other
. We may permit you to make deposits by other means we make available from time to time.
Rules for Mobile Check Deposit
. We may accept a check for deposit to your Deposit Account that is payable to you. We reserve the right to decline acceptance of a Mobile Check, at our discretion. We cannot guarantee that checks you ask us to deposit are valid, and we may return or reverse a deposit we later learn is fraudulent, counterfeit or otherwise invalid. Even if we accept your Mobile Check within the Super App, we reserve the right to decline acceptance at a later time, so it is important that you retain your original paper check in a secure location for at least forty-five (45) days. You must destroy the original paper check after forty-five (45) days and no later than sixty (60) days, unless we have contacted you about our ability to accept the Mobile Check and requested that you retain the check for a longer period of time.
You agree to restrictively endorse any check you deposit as “FOR MOBILE DEPOSIT ONLY, TO MRV Banks” and with your signature. You must endorse checks in the designated area or the area that extends 1 ½ inches from the trailing edge of the back of the check. After you receive confirmation from us that we have received the image of the check, you agree to mark the front of the item as “VOID” to ensure it is not re-presented for payment. We may endorse and collect checks deposited to your Deposit Account without your endorsement, but we may require your personal endorsement, and the personal endorsement of any other person to whom the check is payable, prior to accepting a check for deposit. We may, but are not required to, refuse to deposit any check that bears the endorsement of any other person, or any nonconforming endorsement, we are not required to comply with any other instructions or conditions written on the check, and you agree to hold us harmless from any loss, delay, claim or damage which may result. We may require verification of any endorsement.
When we accept a check for deposit to your Deposit Account, we are acting as your agent in collecting the check and we are not responsible if the check is lost or delayed in the collection process. If a check is lost during the collection process, or if we receive a returned check, a copy of a returned check, or other notice that a check you deposited is returned, we may charge your Deposit Account for the amount of the check, even if this causes a negative balance in your Deposit Account or any Wallet. We reserve the right to charge a Returned Item Fee for any check that is returned unpaid for any reason. By depositing a check (including any remotely created check), you warrant and guarantee that the check is authorized according to the terms on its face by the person identified as the drawer. You agree to indemnify us from all loss, expense, and liability related to a claim that such check was not authorized by the person(s) on whose account it was drawn. We may reject the deposit of any check that is not drawn on a U.S. financial institution or denominated in any currency other than U.S. dollars.
You agree that the image you submit of any check you attempt to deposit will be legible. You agree that we may use the amount shown on the check image or otherwise specified by you to determine the amount of the check, and we may provisionally credit your Deposit Account for that amount. This amount is subject to our subsequent verification and we may adjust your account for any errors.
You agree that you will not deposit or attempt to deposit any ineligible item, as described below in Section I.A.6. If you do, you agree to reimburse us for all claims, losses, costs and damages we incur because the check or other item does not meet applicable standards or causes duplicate payments.
We will use reasonable efforts to make the mobile check deposit service available for your use in the Super App, but we will not assume responsibility for any technical or other difficulties or any resulting damages that you may incur from this service.
Ineligible Items for Deposit
. You agree that you will not deposit or attempt to deposit the following types of checks or other items, each of which are ineligible for deposit to your Super Pay Account:
A third-party check that is made payable to another party and then endorsed to you
A check payable to two or more persons jointly
An item that contains evidence of alteration or fraud
An item with respect to which you are aware of any facts or circumstances that may impair the collectability of the item
A substitute check or check previously converted to a substitute check
A check payable on sight or draft
An item that is drawn on a foreign financial institution or which is denominated in foreign currency
A remotely created check
An expired, post-dated, or stale-dated check
A check that is marked “non-negotiable”
An item that has been re-deposited or returned for any reason
An item that is incomplete or contains blank or invalid fields
A duplicate item
Travelers checks and savings bonds
An image of a check that does not comply with the requirements established from time to time by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, the rules of any clearing house, or applicable law.
Cash
Representations and Warranties for Mobile Check Deposits
. By depositing or attempting to deposit any check using the Mobile Check Deposit feature, you represent, warrant, and covenant to us that:
Each image of a check transmitted to us is a true and accurate depiction of the front and back of the original check, without any alteration, and the drawer of the check has no defense against the payment of the check.
Each check that you submit to us for deposit will not be resubmitted in any format to us or any other person or payment, and will not cause the same drawer’s account to be debited twice.
The amount, payee, drawer, paying bank, MICR (magnetic ink character recognition), signatures, and endorsement on the original check are legible, genuine, and accurate.
Other than the digital image of an original check that you remotely deposit through the Mobile Check Deposit service in the Super App, there is no other duplicate image of the original check.
Each original check was authorized by the drawer in the amount stated on the original check, and to the payee stated on the original check.
You have not knowingly failed to communicate any material information to us
You will retain possession of each original check deposited using the Mobile Check Deposit service for at least two weeks, or such other time period we request, and neither you nor any other party will submit the original check for payment.
You will not use the Mobile Check Deposit service for any illegal activity.
Files and images transmitted to us will contain no viruses or any features that may have an adverse impact on our network, data, or related systems.
You will notify us of any suspected errors regarding items deposited through the Mobile Check Deposit Service immediately, and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Statement on which the deposit first appears is sent. Unless you notify the bank within sixty (60) days, the Statement will be deemed correct and you are prohibited from bringing a claim against the Bank for the alleged error unless required by law.
You accept the risk that a check or image may be intercepted or misdirected during transmission and we bear no liability.
You agree to cooperate with any investigation of the validity of any item you present for deposit and provide all documents we request.
A breach of any of these representations, warranties, or covenants is ground for the immediate termination of your access to the Mobile Check Deposit service, refusal to deposit any item that would cause such a breach, an immediate reversal of a transaction or credit to your Super Pay Account, and any other action we deem appropriate, subject to applicable law.
Early Access to Direct Deposits
. At our sole discretion, we may make funds available for certain direct deposits (for example, payroll payments) as soon as the payor notifies us that the payment has been initiated. This means we can make your money available to you up to 2 days before we receive the funds from the payor and would otherwise make them available to you. Even after we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you remain responsible if any deposit to your account is returned, rejected or otherwise uncollected. We cannot guarantee you early access to any direct deposit. Early access to a direct deposit does not guarantee early access to any subsequent direct deposit. Availability of this benefit may change between your pay periods. Eligibility of each direct deposit for early access is established by us in sole discretion and we reserve the right to refuse to provide early access to any direct deposit for any reason. For example, eligibility may be dependent on our fraud and risk criteria, the timing of your payor’s initiation of the payment, the time when we receive notice that your payor has initiated a payment, and other restrictions, such as transaction limits on your Super Pay Account. These limitations may be based on our confidential fraud and security controls that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of your Super Pay Account, and may be modified at our sole discretion without notice to you. Any direct deposit that is not made available early will otherwise be made available according to our Funds Availability Policy.
Deposit Records and Receipts
. We and our service providers may rely on the account number on any record of a deposit you make, even if that account number is associated with a name that is different from the name you have provided. It is not our responsibility to detect any inconsistency between the account number you provide and the name. You may use the Super App or call us to confirm that we have received a deposit. If you make a deposit, we may provide a confirmation of your deposit, but the amount on your deposit confirmation may not reflect the amount of funds we actually receive. We may confirm the funds you deposit and, after review, may adjust your Deposit Account for any errors including any errors on your deposit request or similar records. If we give you a confirmation for a deposit that you then cancel, the confirmation is void and you may not claim those funds.
Our Right to Refuse Deposits
. We may refuse a deposit, or part of a deposit, at any time. We also may refuse a deposit after initially accepting it. We will not be liable to you for refusing a deposit, even if it causes us to decline any transactions you have already made.
When You Can Withdraw Funds You Have Deposited
. Please see the Funds Availability Policy for information about when deposited funds will be available for withdrawal. If funds from a deposit become available, that does not mean the item deposited is “good,” has “cleared,” or has been paid by the paying bank. It is possible that the item will be returned unpaid months after we have made the funds available and you have withdrawn them.
Our Right to Charge Back Deposited or Cashed Items
. If you make a deposit and (a) the sending bank returns it to us unpaid; (b) the sending bank demands that we repay them because the deposit was unauthorized; or (c) the sending bank or the originator of a transfer demands that we return the item because it was unauthorized, sent to the wrong account number or procured by fraud, we may pay the return or demand, and subtract the funds from your balance in the Deposit Account. If we have reason to believe that any of the events in the previous sentence has occurred or may occur or that the item should not have been paid or may not be paid for any other reason, we may place a hold on the funds or move them to a bank-managed administrative account until we determine who is entitled to them.
All Deposits Are Credited Subject to Final Settlement in Cash or Credits
. We have the right to forward all deposited items to correspondents including all Federal Reserve Banks, and we will not be liable for default or neglect of any correspondents for loss in transit, and no correspondent will be liable except for its own negligence. You specifically authorize us or our correspondents including the Federal Reserve Banks to handle such items in accordance with provisions of Regulation J (12 CFR Part 210), as revised or amended from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board. In the event we are subject to local clearinghouse rules, you specifically authorize us to handle such items in accordance with the rules and regulations of the clearinghouse. If we permit you to withdraw funds from your Deposit Account before final settlement has been made for any deposited item, and final settlement is not made, we have the right to charge your Deposit Account or obtain a refund from you. In addition, we may charge back any deposited item at any time before final settlement for whatever reason. We will not be liable for any damages resulting from the exercise of these rights. Except as may be attributable to our lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care, we will not be liable for dishonor resulting from any reversal of credit, return of deposited items or for any damages resulting from any of those actions.
Withdrawals and Transfers
Available Balance
. You may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the Available Balance in your Deposit Account at any time, provided that the withdrawal will not cause you to exceed the Spending Limit(s) and any other limitations in this Agreement or limits you set on the Deposit Account by using the Super App. We determine your
Available Balance
by taking your previous day’s balance, plus any pending transactions that credit your Deposit Account (excluding pending returns), such as ACH direct deposits, and subtracting (a) pending charges such as, electronic payments, according to the Processing Order (defined in Section I.B.9 below) (b) amount of deposits that are not yet available for withdrawal under our Funds Availability Policy, and (c) any holds on your balance, such as holds on funds to comply with court orders or other legal requirements, or as authorized by the Security Agreement. We reserve the right to use a different method in certain states if required by law.
Withdrawal Rules
. When you initiate a withdrawal of funds from your Deposit Account, you authorize us to make the transaction selected. Withdrawals may be made in U.S. dollars by using the Super App to authorize a transfer of funds to a Linked External Account, to make payments on your Card, to make a P2P transfer to another Super.com user, or to make a transfer to another type of account or payee we may permit from time to time. Withdrawals to a Linked External Account and P2P transfers are processed as ACH transactions. Please see the
Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement
for more information. We may subtract from your Deposit Account balance the amount of any withdrawal, P2P Transfer, or other debit transaction that you or a person you authorized, initiated or approved. We may require you or any person you authorize to provide us with identification, documentation or information that is acceptable to us before allowing the transaction. You may not make or authorize any withdrawal in an amount that exceeds the applicable Spending Limit. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request by any method on forms not approved by us, or that we do not specifically permit for your Deposit Account, or that does not include all information we require, or that is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which is greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on your Deposit Account until your identity is verified. We reserve the right to establish (and change) maximum dollar limits for withdrawal transactions from time to time. Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later.
Cutoff Time
. Online requests to transfer funds to or from your Deposit Account must be received by us by 2:00 PM Eastern Time on a Business Day to be initiated on that Business Day. Online transfer requests received by us after 2:00 PM Eastern Time or on a day that is not a Business Day generally will be initiated on the next Business Day.
Right to Require Advance Notice of Withdrawals
. We reserve the right to require seven days’ notice in writing before each withdrawal.
Account Numbers on Fund Transfers
. If you instruct us to send a fund transfer, such as an ACH transfer, we, our service providers, and every other bank involved in the transfer may rely on any bank number or account number you provide. If the fund transfer instruction gives both a bank number or account number and a name, and the name identifies a different person from the bank or account owner identified by number, we and other banks that handle the fund transfer may still rely exclusively on the number. We have no duty to detect any inconsistency between the bank number or account number and the name.
Withdrawal Authority
. Any person who signs to open your Deposit Account or has authority to make withdrawals may, acting alone, withdraw or transfer all or any part of your Deposit Account balance at any time, subject to the limits set forth in this Agreement. Each of you (until we receive written notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person who signs or has authority to make withdrawals to endorse any item payable to you or your order for deposit to your Deposit Account or any other transaction with us.
Rules for ACH Transfers
. This Agreement is subject to Article 4A of the
Uniform Commercial Code – Fund Transfers
, as adopted in the state in which you have your Deposit Account with us. If you originate a fund transfer and you identify by name and number a beneficiary financial institution, an intermediary financial institution or a beneficiary, we and every receiving or beneficiary financial institution may rely on the identifying number to make payment. We may rely on the number even if it identifies a financial institution, person or account other than the one named. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association rules, such as the NACHA Rules. These rules provide, among other things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional until final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank or payment is otherwise made as provided in Article 4A-403(a) of the
Uniform Commercial Code
. If we do not receive such payment, we are entitled to a refund from you in the amount credited to your Deposit Account and the party originating such payment will not be considered to have paid the amount so credited. If we receive a payment order to credit your Deposit Account, we are not required to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.
Multiple Signatures
. We are not required to comply with any multiple-signature requirement, even if you have otherwise instructed us to do so.
Processing Order
. The following Processing Order
dictates the order in which we will process your transactions on your Deposit Account each Business Day. All credit transactions are processed first. Debits or withdrawals (such as ACH transactions) will be processed in the order in which they are received by us. The processing order of these items is important because if there is not enough money in your Deposit Account to pay for the items in the order they are processed in accordance with the processing order, we may decline the transaction, or it may cause an overdraft on your Deposit Account.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts
. Our general practice is to decline to pay any transaction that would cause an overdraft on your Deposit Account (
i.e.,
your Available Balance or ledger balance in your Deposit Account is less than the amount of that item plus all other items received but not yet paid) (
Overdraft
). Even if we have paid these items before, we are not required to do it in the future. We can change our practice of paying these items on your Deposit Account without notice to you. We may determine the amount of Available Balance for the purpose of deciding whether to return an item for insufficient funds at any time between the time we receive the item and when we return the item or send a notice in lieu of return. This may not occur until the merchant presents the transaction for payment, which may be several days after you authorize a transaction. We need only look at your Available Balance in your Super Pay Account once to decide if the item would cause an Overdraft or negative Available Balance, but if we choose to make a subsequent determination, the Available Balance at the subsequent time will determine whether there are insufficient available funds. It is your responsibility to avoid overdrawing your Deposit Account and maintain an Available Balance of at least $0.00 in your Super Pay Account.
Overdraft Fees
. You agree that we may charge fees for Overdrafts as set forth in the
Fee Schedule
.
Your Responsibility to Pay Overdrafts
. You are liable for any Deposit Account shortage resulting from charges or Overdrafts, whether caused by you or any other person to whom you provide access to your Super Pay Account. If we pay a transaction that causes an Overdraft or negative Available Balance, you must immediately pay the amount of any Overdraft and restore the Available Balance to at least $0.00. You have no right to defer such payments, and you are liable regardless of whether you signed the item or benefitted from the charge or Overdraft. If you fail to pay an Overdraft, we also may report you to consumer reporting agencies, close your Super Pay Account, or both. This could affect your ability to open accounts with us or other banks in the future. We may also apply funds in your Deposit Account to cure a negative Available Balance. You authorize us to use the money from any subsequent deposits to your Deposit Account to pay any Overdraft or apply the deposit to cure a negative Available Balance. Subsequent deposits include any federal or state benefit payments that you choose to deposit in your Deposit Account (including direct deposit of Social Security benefits), unless prohibited by law. You understand and agree that if you do not want your benefits applied in this way, you may change your direct deposit instructions at any time. We may still pursue collection of the amount you owe (including suing you) after it is charged off.
Waiver of Notices
. To the extent permitted by law, you waive any notice of non-payment, dishonor or protest regarding any items credited to or charged against your Deposit Account. For example, if you authorize a transaction and it is returned unpaid or we receive a notice of nonpayment, we do not have to notify you unless required by federal Regulation CC or other law.
Person to Person Transfers.
You may use your Super Pay Account to make person-to-person transfers (
P2P Transfers
) to other Super.com users.
Payment Authorization
. When you authorize a P2P Transfer, you authorize us to debit your Deposit Account for the amount you request to send, plus applicable fees if any, on or after the date of your authorization. We will send that amount (less fees, if any) to your designated recipient. By authorizing a P2P Transfer, you also authorize us to initiate any other transactions necessary to correct errors or reverse payments that are rejected or returned. You may not use an external bank account or any other payment method to fund a P2P Transfer. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have a sufficient Available Balance in your Deposit Account necessary to complete any payments initiated through the P2P Transfer service, and that the transaction will not cause you to exceed any Spending Limit. You agree to reimburse us for any fees, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of insufficient or unavailable funds in connection with any P2P Transfer you initiate.
Restrictions on P2P Transfers to Super.com Users Without Super Pay Account.
If you send a P2P Transfer to a recipient who does not have a Super Pay Account, you authorize us to hold the funds you send on behalf of your recipient, and we will issue promotional credit (
Credit
) to the recipient in lieu of cash. You understand that the recipient cannot redeem the Credit for cash unless and until the recipient opens a Super Pay Account. To send a P2P Transfer, you must provide the recipient’s valid mobile telephone number, which is capable of receiving SMS or “text messages.” If the recipient does not have a username or log-in for Super (
User Account
), the recipient will receive an SMS message notifying them of your P2P Transfer, with instructions for opening a User Account or Super Pay Account and claiming the Credit. Once the recipient has a User Account, the recipient will receive Credit in the amount of the P2P Transfer sent from your Super Pay Account. A User Account is not a Super Pay Account and your recipient may not use a User Account to redeem the Credit for cash. If the recipient opens a Super Pay Account, the Credit will be automatically redeemed for cash and deposited in their Super Pay Account. Credit has no cash value until and unless we redeem the Credit for cash, and credit it to a Deposit Account. Credit is issued solely for promotional purposes and is not FDIC-insured. Credit expires 5 years after the date it is issued, if it is not used or redeemed for cash. If the recipient fails to claim the Credit or their User Account is inactive for an extended period of time, it may be deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under applicable state law. See Super Pay Service Terms for more information.
Transaction Limits
. You may not make P2P Transfers that would cause you to exceed any transaction limits set forth in provision of this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Spending Limit applicable to your Deposit Account. We may reject or reverse any transaction that would cause you or the recipient of the P2P Transfer to exceed limits applicable to their Super Pay Account or User Account, or if we determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Transfer was invalid for any reason. The P2P Transfer service may not be used to conduct business, commercial or merchant transactions. We reserve the right to change these transaction limitations at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice to you, unless required by law.
Stop Payment
. All P2P Transfer requests may be processed as soon as we receive them, and we may be unable to stop the P2P Transfer. Our ability to stop a P2P Transfer once you have initiated it will depend on when you notify us of your desire to stop the transaction, and whether we have begun to process the P2P Transfer or have a reasonable opportunity to act on your request to stop the payment. You may contact
support@super.com
to initiate a Stop Payment request.
Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks
. P2P Transfers may be invalidated or reversed by us if, among other reasons, we send cash or Credit to you or your recipient in error, the funding transaction is declined or reversed, the P2P Transfer was unauthorized or unfunded, or the P2P Transfer was made for activities or reasons that violate this Agreement, the Super Pay Service Terms or any other agreement you have with us. If a P2P Transfer is invalidated for any reason, you may be liable to us for the full amount of the P2P Transfer, and we may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer (plus applicable fees, if any) from you. We may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer from the sender or recipient of the P2P Transfer in our sole discretion (subject to applicable law). When recovering the amount of an invalidated P2P Transfer from you, we may apply any funds sent to you in a subsequent P2P Transfer, from your Deposit Account or any incoming deposit to your Deposit Account, engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you, place a limitation or restriction on your Super Pay Account, or take any other action authorized by this Agreement, Super Pay Service Terms or any other agreement you have with us.
P2P Public Profile
. You may create a profile that is viewable and searchable by others in order to make P2P Transfers. The profile may include a picture, personal information, and transaction information. You are responsible for the content that you upload or add to the profile. The content that you upload or add to the profile will be used, shared, and stored in accordance with the Super.com Privacy Policy.
P2P Requests
. You may use the P2P Transfer service to request payments from your friends and family. When you do so, the Super App will automatically generate a draft text message on your smartphone’s texting feature, to send to the intended recipient. The text message will contain a unique link which the recipient can use to access a payments portal and make a payment to your Deposit Account, using an accepted payment method. The Super App does not automatically send the text message, and requires the person making the request to send the auto-generated message, using the recipient’s valid mobile phone number. The message may be edited, but the unique link may not be changed. If the person who receives the request successfully makes a payment using the unique link, the amount of the payment received will be deposited as cash into your Deposit Account, less applicable fees, if any. The recipient of the message is not required to respond to the request for payment, may choose to send a different amount of money than the amount requested, or choose not to respond or send you any money.
YOU MAY NEVER REQUEST A PAYMENT FROM ANYONE YOU DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY OR MAKE ANY UNSOLICITED REQUESTS FOR MONEY.
Your mobile or data carrier may charge a fee to send and receive these text messages. We are not responsible for these fees.
Other Restrictions
. The P2P Transfer service is subject to all other terms and restrictions set forth in the Super Pay Service Terms, which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the Service Terms and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control.
ADDITIONAL TERMS.
This section applies to all features of your Super Pay Account.
Communications, Statements, Notices of Errors, and Other Notices
Delivery of Notices
. You agree that we and our service providers may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, pre recorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Super Pay Account. Any legal disclosures, notices and communications and other Super Pay Account-related correspondence that we mail to you will be sent via U.S. Mail to the last mailing address shown in our records for your Super Pay Account. Notices will be deemed to have been delivered on the day we mailed it to you, or made it available electronically. We are not responsible for items lost in, or not delivered by, mail or e-mail. Some notices may only be available electronically or in paper form. Notice to any owner of your Super Pay Account is notice to all owners.
Notices You Send Us
. Any written notice you give us is effective after we actually receive and act on it, and it must be given to us according to the specific delivery instructions provided elsewhere, if any. We must receive it in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If the notice is regarding a check or other item, you must give us sufficient information to be able to identify the item, including the item number, amount, date and payee.
Electronic Communication
. Your Super Pay Account is an electronic account. We may send communications electronically, such as by email or text message, rather than through U.S. mail or other means, unless the law says otherwise. If you give us your email address, you agree that we may send servicing messages (such as fraud alerts and hold alerts) related to your Super Pay Account to that address. You may be required to agree to communicate with us by electronic means in order to open a Super Pay Account. If you revoke your consent to electronic communications, we may declare you to be in default of this Agreement, close your Super Pay Account or take other actions described in your
Super Pay Secured Charge Card Agreement
and the Consent to Electronic Communications.
Telephone Communication
. We may record and/or monitor any of our telephone conversations with you. If we do record, we do not have to keep the recordings, unless the law says we must. When you give us your mobile number, we have your permission to contact you at that number about all of your MRV accounts. Your consent allows us and our service providers to use text messaging, artificial or prerecorded voice messages and automatic dialing technology for informational and service calls, but not for telemarketing or sales calls. This communication may include contact from companies working on our behalf to service your Super Pay Account. Message and data rates may apply. You may change these preferences by calling 1 (877) 376-2710 on Monday – Friday between 8AM and 7PM EST or emailing
support@super.com
.
Change in Contact Information
. We require you to provide an email address, mobile telephone number, and physical street address if your mailing address is a P.O. box. You are responsible for promptly notifying us of any change to any such contact information or your name. In some instances, we may request additional information for verification purposes. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you have told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding when sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (
USPS
) or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.
Communications Equipment and Services
. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, mobile, broadband, computer, hardware, software, equipment and services needed to access and use your Super Pay Account online; view, save and/or print your Super Pay Account documents online; receive any messages or documents you have consented to receive electronically; and for paying all related charges. We are not required to act on any instruction or message from you provided by fax, SMS/text, or telephone voice mail, message service or answering machine. Whenever this Agreement or applicable law requires or allows you to give us written notice, we will not consider SMS/text or fax to be written notice.
Closing and Restricting Your Super Pay Account.
You May Close Your Super Pay Account
. You may request to close your Super Pay Account at any time for any reason. However, we are not required to close your Super Pay Account at your request if you have pending transactions, your Deposit Account is overdrawn, your Deposit Account balance is securing an outstanding Super Pay Card Balance, or your Deposit Account is subject to legal process (such as a garnishment, attachment, execution, levy or similar order) or fraud investigation. In those cases, we will restrict your Super Pay Account against all future withdrawals and other transactions, other than under legal process, until pending transactions are paid or returned, the balance on your Deposit Account is no longer negative, there is no outstanding Super Pay Card Balance on any of your Card(s), all investigations have been successfully completed to our satisfaction with no adverse findings, and any legal restriction on your Super Pay Account has been released.
We May Close Your Super Pay Account.
We may also close your Super Pay Account at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without prior notice to you. We will have no liability for any action we take under this section.
Rules for Closing Your Super Pay Account.
We may restrict your Super Pay Account in preparation for closing. As we do so, we will not pay any interest on your Deposit Account, and we may limit deposits to, or withdrawals from, your Deposit Account. We may prohibit further transactions on your Card. Items presented for payment may be dishonored. When you close your Super Pay Account, you are responsible for leaving enough money in your Deposit Account to cover any outstanding items to be paid from your Deposit Account. We may send you a written notice that we have closed your Super Pay Account. We will return the Available Balance in your Deposit Account less any outstanding unpaid Super Pay Card Balance, fees, claims, setoffs or other amounts you owe us, either electronically to a Linked External Account or by check sent to you by mail. This Agreement will survive the closing of your Super Pay Account and you are still responsible for obligations incurred prior to or in connection with the closing of your Super Pay Account. After your Super Pay Account is closed, we have no obligation to accept deposits or pay any outstanding transaction requests, but we may reopen your Deposit Account if we receive a deposit. This Agreement will survive the closing of your Super Pay Account and you are still responsible for obligations incurred prior to or in connection with the closing of your Super Pay Account.
Restricting Your Super Pay Account; Blocking and Delaying Transactions.
There are many reasons we may decline or prevent transactions to or from your Super Pay Account, but we generally do it to protect you or us, or to comply with legal requirements. We may decline or prevent any or all transactions to or from your Super Pay Account in our sole discretion, as permitted by applicable law. We may refuse, freeze, reverse or delay any specific withdrawal, payment or transfer of funds to or from your Deposit Account, or we may remove funds from your Deposit Account to hold them pending investigation, including in one or more of the following circumstances:
You maintain your Deposit Account at zero balance for at least 180 days;
You reside in or relocate outside of the U.S. or any U.S. territory where we offer the Super Pay Account;
You attempt to use your Super Pay Account for business purposes;
Your Super Pay Account is involved in any legal or administrative proceeding;
We receive conflicting information or instructions regarding Super Pay Account ownership, control or activity;
We suspect that you may be the victim of a fraud, scam or financial exploitation, even though you have authorized the transaction(s);
We suspect that any transaction may involve illegal activity, including violations of anti-money laundering laws and regulations, or may be fraudulent;
We are complying in our sole judgment with any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, including federal asset control and sanction rules and anti-money laundering rules, or with our policies adopted to assure that we comply with those laws, rules or regulations; or
We reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to avoid a loss or reduce risk to us.
Other Account Terms
Security
. It is your responsibility to protect the devices on which you access your Super Pay Account, your Card, the username, password, biometrics or other data you use to log into the Super App (
Access Credentials
). Do not share this information with anyone. If you give another person permission to use this information, you may be held fully liable for any transactions they make with your Super Pay Account, even if that person exceeded the authority you gave them. Please notify us immediately if you believe your Super Pay Account has been accessed without your permission. See the
Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement
and your
Super Pay  Secured Charge Card Agreement
of this Agreement for more information about your rights and responsibility in the event of unauthorized use of your Super Pay Account.
Assignment of Agreement and Successors

This Agreement will be binding on your personal representative, executors, administrators and successors, and on our successors and assigns.
Power of Attorney
. A power of attorney is a document you sign that authorizes someone else, called the agent, to act on your behalf. If you sign a power of attorney, the agent can sign on your behalf and do anything you could do regarding your Super Pay Account, including withdrawing or spending all of the money in your Deposit Account. Do not sign a power of attorney unless you trust the agent to act in your best interest. If you choose to add an agent, you must provide a power of attorney form that we agree to accept. We may rely on a copy of an original power of attorney. We are not required to investigate the facts relating to any power of attorney provided to us on your behalf, including whether your signature on the power of attorney is authentic or whether the agent continues to have authority. We may follow or refuse to follow the agent’s instructions at any time, including if we suspect fraud or abuse on your Super Pay Account, unless applicable law requires otherwise. We may also refuse an agent’s request to become a joint owner or a beneficiary of a Super Pay Account, but we have no liability to anyone if we do so. We have no liability when we follow or refuse to follow any instructions from an agent, for example, if your agent misuses the authority you have given them.
Death or Incompetence.
We may continue to honor your transactions and instructions until: (a) we know of your death or adjudication of incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that we may pay or certify transactions made on or before the date of death or adjudication of incompetence for up to 10 days after your death or adjudication of incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the Super Pay Account.
No Waiver
. If we fail to exercise any right, that does not mean that we waive that right or any other right, and we may still enforce all of our rights in the future.
Headings and Rules of Construction
. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience or reference only and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this Agreement should be construed so the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.
Changes to this Agreement
. We may change the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including fees and features of your Super Pay Account, at any time. We will notify you in advance of any such change when required by applicable law. If we have notified you of a change to this Agreement and you continue to use your Super Pay Account after the effective date of the change, you have agreed to the change. Notices will be made available on our Super App and website, or delivered electronically using the most recent contact information we have on file for you.
Legal Actions Affecting Your Super Pay Account.
If we are served with a subpoena, restraining order, writ of attachment or execution, levy, garnishment, search warrant, or similar order relating to your Super Pay Account (
Legal Action
), we will comply with that Legal Action. Or, in our discretion, we may freeze the assets in your Deposit Account and not allow any payments out of your Deposit Account, or use of the Card for obligations secured by your Deposit Account, until a final court determination regarding the legal action. We may do these things even if the legal action involves less than all of your funds in your Deposit Account. In these cases, we will not have any liability to you if there are insufficient funds to pay your items because we have withdrawn funds from your Deposit Account or in any way restricted access to your funds in accordance with the legal action. Any fees or expenses we incur in responding to any legal action (including attorneys' fees and our internal expenses) may be charged against your Super Pay Account. The
Fee Schedule
may specify additional fees that we may charge for certain legal actions.
Illegal Activities
. You agree not to use your Super Pay Account or permit anyone else to use your Super Pay Account for any illegal activity. We may refuse any gambling transaction, whether lawful or not.
Inactive and Unclaimed Accounts
. Each state has laws that govern when accounts are considered inactive or abandoned, and when we are required to send a customer’s funds to the state. We encourage you to make sure your Super Pay Account remains active by signing in to the Super App or making transactions. After a specified period of time determined by the law of the state of your residence (as shown in our records), if we are not able to locate you, we will be required to deliver your Deposit Account to the state as abandoned property. You will then need to apply to the state for return of your funds. If your Super Pay Account is or has been inactive, we may, in our discretion, refuse to honor requests for withdrawals or other transactions on your Super Pay Account until after we have verified that you have authorized the request.
Reporting to Consumer Reporting Agency
;
Disputes
. At our option, we may report information about you or your Super Pay Account and your performance under this Agreement to a consumer reporting agency. We may permit you to opt in or opt out of this reporting.

You may also submit a dispute directly to us by writing to us at
support@super.com
. Provide your name, address and phone number; your Super Pay Account number; the specific information you are disputing; an explanation of why it is inaccurate or incomplete; and any supporting documentation.
Rules Governing Your Super Pay Account.
Except as otherwise provided in the
Arbitration Agreement
, Super Pay , this Agreement, your Super Pay Account and all accounts and the services provided to you, any disputes relating to those accounts and services are governed by Federal Law and, when not superseded by Federal Law, the law of the state where your account is located. Here is how we determine where your account is located.
If you applied for an account in person at one of our banking offices, then the account is located in the state where you applied.
If you applied for the account digitally, or through other remote means, and your address as recorded in our records was in a state where we had a branch at the time, then the account is located in that state which for joint accounts, will be based on the address of the owner whose name was listed first.
In all other cases, your account will be governed by Missouri law.
Changes in these laws may change the terms and conditions of your Super Pay Account. We will notify you of any changes as required by law. Except as otherwise provided in the
Arbitration Agreement
, if any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. If this Agreement conflicts with any statements made by one of our employees or by a third-party service provider, this Agreement will govern.
Fees
. You agree to the terms of this Agreement and the
Fee Schedule
. You authorize us to deduct these charges, without notice to you, directly from the balance of your Deposit Account as accrued. You will pay any additional reasonable charges for services you request which are not covered by this Agreement.
Attorneys’ Fees Resulting from Collection or Dispute
. You will be liable for our costs as well as for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by law, whether incurred as a result of collection or in any other dispute involving your Super Pay Account. This includes you or a third party claiming an interest in your Super Pay Account. This also includes any action that you or a third party takes regarding the Super Pay Account that causes us, in good faith, to seek the advice of an attorney, whether or not we become involved in the dispute. All costs and attorneys’ fees can be deducted from your Deposit Account balance when they are incurred, without notice to you.
Limitation of Liability
. You agree that we, our service providers, agents, officers, directors, and employees (and the same of our service providers, subsidiaries and affiliates themselves) (collectively, the
Indemnified Parties
) will not be liable for anything we do when following your instructions. In addition, the Indemnified Parties will not be liable if any such Indemnified Party does not follow your instructions if we reasonably believe that your instructions would expose us to potential loss or civil or criminal liability, or conflict with customary banking practices. To the extent you are entitled to relief under this Agreement, the total liability of the Indemnified Parties to you will not exceed $500, except as otherwise required by applicable law. THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION AND EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF WE FAIL TO STOP PAYMENT ON AN ITEM, OR PAY AN ITEM BEARING AN UNAUTHORIZED SIGNATURE, FORGED SIGNATURE, OR FORGED ENDORSEMENT OR ALTERATION, OUR LIABILITY, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FACE AMOUNT OF THE ITEM. This section will survive termination of your Super Pay Account and termination of this Agreement.
Indemnification
. You agree to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against losses arising in connection with the services provided under this Agreement, except for losses arising out of our own gross negligence or willful misconduct. You further agree to hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from losses arising out of actions taken or omitted in good faith by any Indemnified Party in reliance upon instructions from you. The Indemnified Parties are not responsible for any actions or omissions by any third party. If you give us instructions that we believe may expose us to potential liability, we may refuse to follow your instructions and we will not be liable to you if we refuse to follow your instructions. If we do choose to follow your instructions, we may ask you for certain protections such as a surety bond or an indemnity agreement in a form that is satisfactory to us. This section will survive termination of your Super Pay Account and termination of this Agreement.
Filing a Lawsuit or Arbitration
. You must file any lawsuit or arbitration against the Indemnified Parties within two years after the cause of action arises, unless federal or state law or an applicable agreement provides for a shorter time. This limit is in addition to limits on notice as a condition to making a claim. If applicable state law does not permit contractual shortening of the time during which a lawsuit must be filed to a period as short as two years, you and we agree to the shortest permitted time under that state’s laws. We abide by applicable federal and state record retention laws and may dispose of any records that we retained or preserved for the period set forth in these laws. Any action against us or another Indemnified Party must be brought within the period that the law requires us to preserve records, unless applicable law or this Agreement provides a shorter limitation period or applicable law requires a longer limitation period. This section is subject to Section II.C.28, which may require you to submit your claims to arbitration. This section will survive termination of your Super Pay Account and termination of this Agreement.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
Location of Legal Proceedings
. If you file any lawsuit or other legal proceeding against an Indemnified Party that is connected in any way to your Super Pay Account or services, you agree to do so in an appropriate court in the State of Missouri. If we file any lawsuit or legal proceeding that is connected in any way to your Super Pay Account or this Agreement, you consent to jurisdiction and venue in an appropriate court in the State of Missouri. If any party chooses to have disputes resolved by arbitration, the
Arbitration Agreement
governs the process and location of the arbitration proceedings.
Pre
-
Judgment Interest Rate
. If either you or we are awarded a judgment against the other in connection with your Super Pay Account, the rate of interest earned before judgment on the judgment amount will be the rate of interest your Deposit Account earned during that period unless state law requires a different rate.
Unlawful Internet Gambling Notice
. Restricted transactions as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG are prohibited from being processed through this Super Pay Account or relationship. Restricted transactions generally include those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful Internet gambling.
Severability
. Any provision of this Agreement that limits the Bank’s liability does not negate the Bank’s duty (if any) under applicable law to act in good faith and with ordinary care. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to limit the Bank’s liability in a way prohibited by applicable law, or to be otherwise unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such provision with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified.
Joint, Trust, Fiduciary and Custodial Accounts
. You acknowledge that if your account is set up as a joint, trust, fiduciary or custodial account, it is your sole responsibility to determine the legal effects of opening and maintaining an account of this nature.
Joint Account With/Without Right of Survivorship
. If this account is noted as a joint account with right of survivorship, on the death of one party to a joint account, all sums in the account on the death vest in and belong to the surviving party(ies) as his or her separate property and estate. In the event this account is designated as a joint account without right of survivorship and we receive written notice of death of any person named on the account, we may freeze the account until we have received satisfactory evidence as to the disposition of the account. If the account is between spouses, the account shall be considered held as a tenancy by the entirety unless otherwise noted.
Wisconsin residents:  If one owner of a marital account dies, the survivor is entitled to 50% of the account funds and the estate of the deceased is entitled to the other 50%.  If a marital account contains a payable on death designation, the beneficiary is entitled to the deceased spouse’s 50% share.  We will have no responsibility to determine respective interests of the owner and the payable on death beneficiary.
Florida residents:  A Florida joint account owned solely by two spouses is a “tenants by the entirety” account unless the signature card or application materials designate otherwise.  We are not required to determine whether an account is a tenants by the entirety account before responding to a garnishment or other legal process.  We may assert our right of setoff or security interest in a tenants by the entirety account in order to collect debts of either owner.
Pay on Death or In Trust For Account
. The type of account ownership may determine how your funds are paid if you die, even if your Will states otherwise. Please consult your estate planning advisor or attorney about your choices. If this account is designated as a Pay on Death account, such account shall, during the lifetime of the person(s) first named on the account as the depositor(s), be the property of and under the sole control of such person(s). Depositor(s) shall be entitled to cancel, change, give away, or otherwise deal with the account as if no other person was named on the account. At the death of all depositors, the account shall become the property of the person(s) named as the "Pay on Death" person(s). This account is governed by the choice of law provisions set forth herein in Section II.C.12 unless otherwise required by law. We are authorized to require proof of death and surrender of the evidence of the account prior to withdrawal after the death of all of the depositors. If there is more than one depositor who is a holder of the account, the depositors shall be joint tenants with right of survivorship. Any payment that we make on the account shall be entitled to full credit upon such payment without the necessity of determining whether any other person shall have an interest in the account, unless we have been served with process by a court of competent jurisdiction restricting payment on the account in accordance with the terms of such process. If the account is noted as an In Trust For account, you agree to perform all of your duties as trustee for the account as required by law. You may change the named beneficiary at any time. When the trustee makes a deposit and no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust other than this description shall have been given in writing to us, in the event of the death of the trustee, the deposit or any part of the deposit, together with the interest, may be paid to the beneficiary for whom the deposit was thus stated to be made to the extent permitted by law.
Representative Payee Accounts
. If you open an account as a representative payee for someone who receives social security payments, or as a legal custodian, spouse payee, or other custodian for someone who receives Veterans Administration payments, you agree not to permit any deposits to the account other than the designated payments. We are not required to determine whether you deposit other funds or whether any withdrawals or transfers from the account are for the support of the person for whose benefit the funds are paid.
Foreign Exchange Transactions
. The exchange rate applied to transactions that occur in a different currency will be selected by the network that processes the transaction. The network will select from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets or a rate mandated by the government that issues or controls the currency in that country on the date in which the transaction is processed. The date on which the transaction processes from which the exchange rate is applied may differ from the date you used your account. When the transaction is posted to your account, we will charge a foreign exchange rate adjustment fee on the transaction amount after conversion to U.S. dollars. The exchange rate we may use may include a spread, commission or other costs that we, our affiliates or vendors charge in providing for an exchange to you. The exchange rate may vary among customers depending on the type of transaction being conducted, the dollar amount, the currency involved, and the date and the time of the exchange. You should expect these rates will be less favorable than rates quoted on line or in publications.
Escheatment/Abandonment
. If your account is closed, we will return any balance, less any fees, claims, set-offs or other amounts which may be applied against your balance. Funds that cannot be returned or transferred may be considered abandoned under the jurisdiction in which you reside. Each state has its own laws that govern escheatment and when we are required to send a customer’s funds to that state.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
Agreement to Arbitrate
‍
This section is referred to as the
Arbitration Agreement
. If you have a dispute with the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, and are not able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process set forth in this section.
‍
Arbitration
‍
You agree that if you have a dispute or claim that has arisen or may arise between you and the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach), your Super Pay Account and services provided under this Agreement, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, and you are not able to resolve the dispute or claim informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute or claim will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and the Bank are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
‍
Parties Subject to this Arbitration Agreement
This Arbitration Agreement applies whenever there is a claim between you and us. If a third party, such as an Indemnified Party other than the Bank, is also involved in a claim between you and us, or if a dispute arises between you and an Indemnified Party other than the Bank relating to this Agreement or your Super Pay Account, then the claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party.
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A COVERED BORROWER UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE COVERED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT, IN WHICH CASE THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, PLEASE CONTACT US AT
support@super.com
.
‍
Exclusions
You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so failing will bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration.
‍
Your Right to Opt Out
If you do not want this Arbitration Agreement to apply to your Super Pay Account, you may opt out by sending us written notice of your decision within 30 days of the opening of your Super Pay Account. Such notice must clearly state that you wish to cancel or opt out of the Arbitration Agreement section of this Agreement. It should include your name, address, Super Pay Account number, and your signature and must be and must be emailed to
optout@super.com
. This is the sole and only method by which you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Your exercise of the right to opt-out will not affect any remaining terms of this Agreement and will not result in any adverse consequence to you or your Super Pay Account. You agree that our business records will be final and conclusive evidence with respect to whether you canceled or opted out of this Arbitration Agreement in a timely and proper fashion.
‍
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
‍
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE BANK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at
support@super.com
. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (Notice). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (Notice Address). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within 60 calendar days after the Notice is received, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank is entitled.
‍
Arbitration Procedures
‍
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (
AAA
) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the
AAA Rules
), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,
http://www.adr.org
. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration
. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
Costs of Arbitration
‍
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
Arbitration Fees
) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, the Bank will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
‍
Confidentiality
‍
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
Severability
‍
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non
-
Individualized Relief
section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Super Pay Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).

FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
PURPOSE
. The information here describes our policy of holding deposited items in a Deposit Account before funds are made available to you for withdrawal.
‍
DETERMINING THE AVAILABILITY OF YOUR DEPOSIT
. Our policy is to delay the availability of funds from your deposits. The length of the delay varies based on the type of deposit as set forth below. During the delay, you may not withdraw the funds, and we will not pay transactions from your Deposit Account using these funds.
The length of the delay is counted in Business Days from the day we receive your deposit.
If you make a deposit before
1:00 PM ET
on a Business Day, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after
1:00PM ET
or on a day that is not a Business Day, we will consider the deposit made on the next Business Day.
‍
Same Day Availability
. Electronic direct deposits (e.g., ACH, person-to-person transfers, and other EFTs your Deposit Account supports) will be available on the day we receive your deposit.
‍
Next Day Availability
. Funds from the following deposits are available on the first Business Day after the day we receive your deposit:
U.S. Treasury checks that are payable to you.
The first $225.00 of check deposits.
Cash deposits that are not made in person to an employee of MRV Banks.
Second Business Day
. Unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, all other funds from deposits will be made on the second Business Day after the day we receive your deposit.
Longer Delays May Apply
. Funds you deposited by check may be delayed for longer than two Business Days under the following circumstances:
We believe a check you deposited will not be paid;
You deposited checks totaling more than $5,000 in any one day;
You redeposited a check that has been returned unpaid;
You have overdrawn your Deposit Account repeatedly in the last six months; or
There is an emergency, such as failure of communications or our systems.
If we delay availability for one of these reasons, funds may not be available until the seventh Business Day after the day of your deposit. We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available.
‍
Special Rules for New Accounts
. If you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your Deposit Account is open.
Funds from electronic direct deposits to your Deposit Account will be available on the first Business Day after we receive the deposit.
Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers, and the first $5,000 of a day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's, and federal, state and local government checks] will be available on the first Business Day after the day of your deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions.
The excess over $5,000 will be available no later than the ninth Business Day after the day of your deposit.
Funds from all other check deposits will be available on the third Business Day after the day of your deposit.
Foreign Checks
. Checks drawn on financial institutions outside of the U.S. (foreign checks) cannot be processed the same as checks drawn on U.S. financial institutions. Foreign checks are exempt from the policies outlined in this disclosure. Generally, if your Deposit Account permits you to deposit foreign checks, the availability of funds from deposits of foreign checks will be delayed for the time it takes us to collect the funds from the financial institutions upon which they are drawn.
‍
Your Responsibility for Deposits
. Even if we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you are still responsible for deposits that are returned to us unpaid and for any other problems involving your deposit.
‍
ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER AGREEMENT
Electronic Fund Transfers: Your Rights and Responsibilities
This disclosure contains important information about your use of electronic fund transfer (EFT) services provided by the Bank in connection with your Super Pay Account. Whenever you accept or authorize EFTs to your Deposit Account, you agree to these terms and conditions, in addition to any other applicable limitations in this Agreement concerning deposits to and withdrawals from your Deposit Account. Please read this document carefully and retain it for future reference.
Business Days
. Our Business Days are every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST except Federal holidays on which banks in Missouri are legally authorized to be closed.
‍
Types of Available EFTs
Online ACH Transfers
‍
You may use the Super App and request ACH transfers between your Deposit Account and a Linked External Account.
‍
Limits on the Type, Frequency or Amount of EFTs
‍
Your Deposit Account may be subject to limitations on the amount or number of withdrawals that you may make from your Deposit Account, including EFTs. Please see Article IV of this Agreement and the
Truth in Savings Disclosures
. For security reasons, we may also, in our sole discretion, set limits on the dollar amounts of EFTs and on the number of EFTs that may be requested or initiated. To protect the security of the Bank or your Deposit Account, we may suspend your use of EFTs, as permitted by law.
‍
Managing Your Super Pay Account Balance
‍
You agree that the amount of any EFT debit transaction you authorize will not exceed the Available Balance in your Deposit Account used to make the transaction, or your Spending Limit. We do not have to allow any EFT that would create an overdraft in your Deposit Account. We may in our sole discretion choose to permit an EFT that would create an overdraft in your Deposit Account. If we are unable to complete an EFT or perform any other EFT service for any reason associated with your Deposit Account, the EFT or other service may not be completed and we will not notify you unless required by applicable law.
‍
Your Rights and Responsibilities
The use of EFT services described in this Agreement creates certain rights and responsibilities regarding these services as described below.
‍
Documentation of Your EFTs
Periodic Statements
‍
All EFT transactions will be reported on your periodic statement. See Section II.A.8 of this Agreement for more information.
‍
Direct Deposits
‍
If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your Deposit Account at least once every 60 days, the company making the deposit may tell you every time they send us the money. You may also call us at 1 (877) 376-2710 to find out whether or not the deposit has been made.
‍
Confirmation
‍
You may call us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or write to us at
support@super.com
to find out whether any EFT you request was successfully completed.
‍
Preauthorized and Other Regular (Automatic) Debits
Right to Stop Payment and Procedure for Doing So
If you have told us in advance to make regular payments out of your Deposit Account, you can stop any of the payments. Here is how:
‍
Call us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or write to us at Super Pay
support@super.com
, in time for us to receive your request three Business Days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you contact us to stop a payment, please have the following information ready: your Super Pay Account number, the date the transfer is to be made, to whom the transfer is being made, and the amount of the scheduled transfer. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call. Stop-payment orders may expire after six months from the date of your stop-payment request, and you may be required to renew it in order to ensure its continued effectiveness.
‍
Liability for Failure to Stop Payment of Preauthorized Transfer
If you order us to stop a preauthorized automatic debit three Business Days or more before the transfer is scheduled and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.
‍
Notice of Varying Amounts
If you have authorized regular payments out of your Deposit Account, and these regular payments may vary in amount, we or the person you are going to pay will tell you, 10 days before each payment, when it will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.
‍
Our Refusal to Pay a Preauthorized or Other Regular (Automatic) Debit
We reserve the right to refuse to pay a regular (automatic) debit, for example, if your Deposit Account has insufficient funds to cover such transfer or if we are unable to verify the ownership of or other information about the account to which the funds will be transferred. You may call us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or email us at
support@super.com
to request information about a refusal by us to pay a regular (automatic) debit.
‍
Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers
During your online Super Pay Account set-up, you will be invited to register your phone number and create Access Credentials to protect your Super Pay Account from unauthorized access. You are responsible for maintaining ownership of the mobile device associated with the phone number and security of your other Access Credentials.
‍
Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that any Access Credentials or device you use to access your Super Pay Account has been lost or stolen, that an EFT has been made without your permission, or that someone has transferred or may transfer money from your Deposit Account without your authorization
. You may tell us by calling us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or by writing to us as soon as possible at
support@super.com
(or such other address as we may provide to you from time to time).
Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down.
You could lose all the money in your Deposit Account. If you tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Access Credentials or device, your liability will be limited to $50 if someone accesses your Deposit Account without your authorization.
‍
If you DO NOT tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Access Credentials or device, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Access Credentials or device without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
‍
Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us AT ONCE. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
‍
If you grant authority to make transfers to another person who exceeds the authority granted, you are fully liable for any transfers until you notify us that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.
‍
In Case of Errors or Questions about your EFTs
Call us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or write us at
support@super.com
as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we send the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.
‍
(1) Tell us your name and your Super Pay Account number (if any).
(2) Describe the error or transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.
(3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.
We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your Deposit Account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes
us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your Deposit Account.
‍
For errors involving new Super Pay Accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new Super Pay Accounts, we may take up to 20 days to credit your Deposit Account for the amount you think is in error.
‍
We will tell you the results within three Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
‍
Our Liability for Failure to Make a Transfer
If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Deposit Account on time or in the correct amount according to this Agreement, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:
If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Deposit Account to make the transfer.
If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line of credit, if you have one.
If an automated teller machine where you are making a transfer does not have enough cash. If a system or terminal you use to make a transfer was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.
If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.
There may be other exceptions stated in this Agreement.
‍
Person to Person Money transmission
‍
The liability protections provided in this paragraph do not apply to transactions involving person to person money transmission services or similar payment transmission services.  Please be advised federal laws providing certain consumer protections with respect to fraudulent deposit account activities may not apply to transactions made using person to person money transmission services.  As such, customers are advised to use caution when transmitting money using person to person money transmission services.  You should only send money using such services to known and reliable recipients.
‍
Charges for Transfers or the Right to Make Transfers
We may assess a fee for each EFT, or stop-payment order. Please see the applicable
Fee Schedule
to determine the applicable amount. The circumstances under which such charges will be assessed, as well as the amount of the charge, are included in the current
Fee Schedule
.
‍
Confidentiality
We will disclose information to third parties about your Super Pay Account or the transfers you make:
‍
(1) Where it is necessary for completing transfers;
(2) In order to verify the existence and condition of your Super Pay Account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant;
(3) In order to comply with government agency or court orders;
(4) To persons authorized by law in the course of their official duties;
(5) To our employees, auditors, service providers, attorneys, or collection agents in the course of their duties;
(6) As disclosed in our Privacy Notice; and,
(7) If you give us your written permission.
‍
Amendments
We may change any provision of this
Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement
at our sole discretion. If we do, we will give you notice if and to the extent required by applicable law.
‍
Termination
‍
We reserve the right to terminate your use of any or all of our EFT services for any reason and at any time without notifying you. You also have the right to terminate your use of the EFT services described in this Agreement at any time by calling us or writing to us. If you call, we may require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 10 Business Days after you call. (Please note that e-mail, SMS/text or online notification will not meet the notice requirements of this section.) If you terminate your use of our EFT services and you have arranged for automatic (regular) transfers involving third parties, you are required to inform any third parties that the transfers will cease. Any termination of your use of our EFT services, whether initiated by you or us, will not affect any of your or our rights and obligations under this Agreement that have arisen before the effective date of such termination.

Super.com Card and Deposit Account Need to Know
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SUPER.COM SECURED CHARGE CARD AND THE SUPER.COM DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
‍
THIS IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN KEY TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SUPER.COM CHARGE CARD (“CARD”) AND THE SUPER.COM DEPOSIT ACCOUNT (“DEPOSIT ACCOUNT”) OFFERED BY REPUBLIC BANK & TRUST COMPANY (“REPUBLIC BANK”). YOU CAN GET THE COMPLETE TERMS AT SUPER.COM/LEGAL AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT SUPER.COM/SUPPORT.
‍
How it Works:
‍
The Super.com Card is a secured charge card available to you if you are a Super+ Member and you have a Super.com Deposit Account. Because the Card is a charge card, you are required to pay off your Card Balance each month.
Your Card credit limit is $5,000 and your card is secured by your Deposit Account. The amount available for your use (“Available Credit”) depends on how much money you have available in your Deposit Account. You must first add funds to your Deposit Account to make a purchase with your Card
When you use your Card for purchases or an ATM Cash Advance, the amount of that transaction will reduce your Available Balance and Available Credit. Although funds in your Deposit Account are used to repay your outstanding Card balance, Card transactions are credit transactions and do not debit your Deposit Account.
The Deposit Account can be funded with direct deposits, ACH transfers from an external bank account, transfers from an external debit card, Person-to-Person Transfers from other Super.com users, or Super+ Membership earnings. Funds in your Deposit Account are held at Republic Bank and are FDIC insured.
You can withdraw available funds from your Deposit Account by ACH transfer to an external bank account or Person-to-Person Transfer to other Super.com users. You may use the Bank Account and Routing information for your Deposit Account to have external merchants debit the account for bill payments. ACH withdrawals are subject to the limits and fees in the “What it Costs” section below.
You can use your virtual or physical (if you request one) Card to make purchases everywhere Mastercard is accepted, earn cash back rewards, and take cash advances via an ATM. When making purchases with the Card, Super+ Members receive 10% cashback on all hotel bookings made through Super.com and 1% cashback on everything else.
When you access your Card or Deposit Account on the Super.com App or website, you can find your balance information and your Bank Account and Routing numbers, access FAQs, view your credit score, access your monthly statement, and update your account information.
You have the option to have Republic Bank report your Card activity, including payments, to the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax). This may help build your credit; however, once you opt in to credit reporting, you cannot opt-out.
Information about your Card and Deposit Accounts will be provided to you electronically. It is important for you to keep your contact information, including your email address, current.
‍
What it Costs:
Super.com Card
The Super.com Card has no monthly or annual account maintenance fees, no interest charges, no statement fees, and no late fees. You are, however, required to be a Super+ Member to be eligible for the Card, which costs $15.00/month.
If you obtain an ATM Cash Advance using an ATM outside of the MoneyPass network, you will incur a $2.50 fee from Republic Bank, as well as any fees that the ATM operator may impose. There are no ATM Cash Advance fees if you use a MoneyPass ATM.
Expedited delivery of a replacement Card costs $25.
Any currency exchange fees are determined by Mastercard.
Super.com Deposit Account
The Super.com Deposit Account has no statement fees, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, or stop payment fees.
You can initiate one (1) free ACH withdrawal from your Deposit Account per calendar month. Any ACH withdrawal thereafter in the same month will incur a fee of 1.5%, with a maximum fee of $5 assessed per withdrawal. ACH withdrawals are limited to only funds that have been deposited to your Deposit Account from direct deposit, ACH transfer, or external debit card.
A $5.00 Check Fee will be assessed if you request a check when you close your Deposit Account.
‍
Payments:
The Card is a charge card, meaning the balance must be paid in full each month. A Statement will be made available to you online monthly with information about your balance and the Payment Due. This information is also available on the Super.com website or the Super.com App.
You must make Card payments from your Deposit Account. You can set up automatic recurring payments (AutoPay) or make one-time manual payments.
With Autopay, you authorize Republic Bank to debit the Payment Due on the Auto Payment Date shown in your Statement from your Deposit Account. The Auto Payment Date will be 10 days before your Payment Due Date. If you have elected for us to report your Card information to the credit bureaus, by debiting your Payment Due before your Payment Due Date, we will report a lower credit utilization to the credit bureau.
If you do not enable Autopay, you will need to manually log into your Deposit Account to pay your Payment Due on or before the Payment Due Date shown in your Statement. If you do not make your Payment Due by the Payment Due Date, Republic Bank will exercise its security interest and use the funds we have secured in your Deposit Account to satisfy your Payment Due.

‍
THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
AS DESCRIBED BELOW IN SECTION XII.
BINDING CONTRACT.
This Super.com Deposit Account Agreement, including the Fee Schedule and other Deposit Account opening documents for your Deposit Account, are part of the binding contract between you and us (collectively, the “Deposit Agreement”) for your Deposit Account. They contain the terms of our agreement with you. Please read all of these documents carefully. The Deposit Agreement also summarizes certain laws and regulations that apply to common transactions, provides some disclosures for deposit accounts required by applicable law, and establishes terms that cover some transactions or situations that the law either does not cover or allows us to change by this contract. In order to obtain and maintain a Deposit Account, you must also agree to and comply with the Terms of Use and Service Terms required by Super.com and its affiliates. When you complete our Deposit Account opening process, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and understand the terms of the Deposit Agreement and you agree to be governed by these terms.

You may obtain additional copies of the Deposit Agreement at the Super.com website (the “Site”) at Super.com/legal or in the Super.com mobile application (the “Super.com App”). Our deposit relationship with you is that of creditor. The Deposit Agreement and the deposit relationship do not create a fiduciary, quasi-fiduciary, or special relationship between us regardless of how you title your Deposit Account, or whether you act in a fiduciary or similar capacity with respect to funds deposited with us. We owe you only a duty of ordinary care. Our internal policies and procedures are solely for our own purposes and do not impose on us a higher standard of care than otherwise would apply by law without such policies or procedures.

governing your Super.com Card for more information. You will not be able to make deposits to your Super.com Deposit Account at branch locations, by telephone, at the point of sale, or at ATMs.
Processing Order
. The Processing Order
set forth in this section dictates the order in which we will process your transactions on your Super.com Deposit Account each Business Day. When we receive deposits and Items, and make them available to you, depends on the nature of the deposit or Item and a number of other factors, as further described in
SECTION VII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
. Generally, all transactions are processed in the order in which they are received by us. When Items are presented at the same time (for example, ACH transactions), credits will be applied first, then debit transactions in the order of lowest to highest dollar amount. The processing order of these items is important because if there is not enough money available in your Deposit Account to secure the Items in the order they are processed we may decline the transaction.

FDIC Insurance
. Funds in your Super.com Deposit Account are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) through Republic Bank and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, up to the applicable limit. The amount of insurance coverage you have may depend on the balance in your Deposit Account and the ownership, type of, and balances held in any other accounts you have with us. For additional information, please visit the FDIC’s website at www.fdic.gov. You agree and acknowledge that your deposit may be aggregated with other deposits in one or more accounts of our choosing.
‍
Deposit Requirements
. Deposits must be made in U.S. Dollars. Deposits made by ACH are subject to the
Nacha Operating Rules and Operating Guideline
and the rules of any regional clearing houses we may use from time to time (collectively, the “ACH Rules”). Before final settlement of any deposit, we act only as your agent. We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items we accept for deposit (including items drawn “on us”). You authorize us to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in attempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond an applicable deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect or that we select in our sole discretion on final collection in U.S. dollars. We will treat and record all transactions received after the Cutoff Time (defined below) on a Business Day we are open or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next Business Day that we are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit.
‍
Early Access to Direct Deposits
. At our sole discretion, we may make funds available for certain direct deposits (for example, payroll payments) as soon as the payor notifies us that the payment has been initiated. This means we can make your money available to you up to two (2) days before we receive the funds from the payor and would otherwise make them available to you. Even after we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you remain responsible if any deposit to your Deposit Account is returned, rejected or otherwise uncollected. We cannot guarantee you early access to any direct deposit. Early access to a direct deposit does not guarantee early access to any subsequent direct deposit. Availability of this benefit may change between your pay periods. Eligibility of each direct deposit for early access is established by us in sole discretion and we reserve the right to refuse to provide early access to any direct deposit for any reason. For example, eligibility may be dependent on our fraud and risk criteria, the timing of your payor’s initiation of the payment, the time when we receive notice that your payor has initiated a payment, and other restrictions, such as transaction limits on your Super.com Deposit Account. These limitations may be based on our confidential fraud and security controls that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of your Super.com Deposit Account, and may be modified at our sole discretion without notice to you. Any direct deposit that is not made available early will otherwise be made available according to
SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
.
‍
Deposit Records and Receipts
. We and our service providers may rely on the Deposit Account Number on any record of a deposit you make, even if that Deposit Account Number is associated with a name that is different from the name you have provided. It is not our responsibility to detect any inconsistency between the Deposit Account Number you provide and the name. You may use the Super.com App or the Site or call us to confirm that we have received a deposit. If you make a deposit, we may provide a confirmation of your deposit, but the amount on your deposit confirmation may not reflect the amount of funds we actually receive. We may confirm the funds you deposit and, after review, may adjust your Deposit Account for any errors including any errors on your deposit request or similar records. If we give you a confirmation for a deposit that you then cancel, the confirmation is void and you may not claim those funds.
‍
Our Right to Refuse Deposits
. We may refuse a deposit, or part of a deposit, at any time. We also may refuse a deposit after initially accepting it. We will not be liable to you for refusing a deposit, even if it causes us to decline any transactions you have already made.
‍
When You Can Withdraw Funds You Have Deposited
. Please see
SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
for information about when deposited funds will be available for withdrawal. If funds from a deposit become available, that does not mean the item deposited is “good,” has “cleared,” or has been paid by the paying bank. It is possible that the item will be returned unpaid months after we have made the funds available and you have withdrawn them.
‍
Our Right to Charge Back Deposited or Cashed Items
. If you make a deposit and (a) the sending bank returns it to us unpaid; (b) the sending bank demands that we repay them because the deposit was unauthorized; or (c) the sending bank or the originator of a transfer demands that we return the Item because it was unauthorized, sent to the wrong account number or procured by fraud, we may pay the return on demand, and subtract the funds from your balance in the Super.com Deposit Account. If we have reason to believe that any of the events in the previous sentence has occurred or may occur or that the Item should not have been paid or may not be paid for any other reason, we may place a hold on the funds or move them to a Bank-managed administrative account until we determine who is entitled to them.
‍
All Deposits Are Credited Subject to Final Settlement in Cash or Credits
. We have the right to forward all deposited Items to correspondents including all Federal Reserve Banks, and we will not be liable for default or neglect of any correspondents for loss in transit, and no correspondent will be liable except for its own negligence. You specifically authorize us or our correspondents including the Federal Reserve Banks to handle such items in accordance with provisions of Regulation J (12 CFR Part 210), as revised or amended from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board. In the event we are subject to local clearinghouse rules, you specifically authorize us to handle such items in accordance with the rules and regulations of the clearinghouse. If we permit you to withdraw funds from your Deposit Account before final settlement has been made for any deposited item, and final settlement is not made, we have the right to charge your Deposit Account or obtain a refund from you. In addition, we may charge back any deposited Item at any time before final settlement for whatever reason. We will not be liable for any damages resulting from the exercise of these rights. Except as may be attributable to our lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care, we will not be liable for dishonor resulting from any reversal of credit, return of deposited Items or for any damages resulting from any of those actions.
‍
Withdrawal Rules.
When you initiate a withdrawal of funds from your Super.com Deposit Account, you authorize us to make the transaction selected. Withdrawals may be made in U.S. dollars by using the Super.com App or the Site to authorize a transfer of funds to a Linked External Account, to make payments on your Super.com Card, to make a P2P transfer to another Super.com user, or to make a transfer to another type of account or payee we may permit from time to time. Only funds deposited to your Super.com Deposit Account from direct deposit, a Linked External Account, or Linked Debit Card can be transferred from your Super.com Deposit Account to a Linked External Account. Please see Section IX.
ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS
for more information. We may subtract from your Deposit Account Balance the amount of any withdrawal, P2P Transfer, or other debit transaction that you or a person you authorized, initiated or approved. We may require you or any person you authorize to provide us with identification, documentation or information that is acceptable to us before allowing the transaction. You may not make or authorize any withdrawal in an amount that exceeds your Available Balance or any other limit we may impose on your Deposit Account from time to time. There are other limits on the amount, type, and frequency of transactions you may make on your Deposit Account. See
Section
X
. LIMITS
for details. We will disclose these limits and changes to these limits when required by applicable law. We may not disclose these limits, for example, if it is necessary to maintain the security of your Deposit Account or our systems. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request by any method on forms not approved by us, or that we do not specifically permit for your Super.com Deposit Account, or that does not include all information we require, or that is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which is greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on your Super.com Deposit Account until your identity is verified. We reserve the right to establish (and change) maximum dollar limits for withdrawal transactions from time to time. Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later.
‍
Permitted Withdrawals:
Withdrawals from your Super.com Deposit Account may be made using one of the following methods:
Linked External Account
. You may authorize us to initiate ACH transfers from your Super.com Deposit Account to a Linked External Account. Only funds deposited to your Super.com Deposit Account from direct deposit, a Linked External Account, or a Linked Debit Card are available for transfer to a Linked External Account. Use the Super.com App or the Site to set up, review, change or cancel your scheduled transfers.
Payments to Super.com Card:
You must make required payments to your Super.com Card using funds in your Super.com Deposit Account. Please refer to your
Super.com Charge Card Agreement
for details.
Person-to-Person Transfer with Super.com Users
. You can send ACH transfers to another Super.com user with an Deposit Account, using the person-to-person transfer services (“P2P Transfer”) provided in the Super.com App or the Site pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
Other
. We permit you to make withdrawals by other means we make available from time to time.
Available Balance
. You may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the Available Balance in your Deposit Account at any time, provided that the withdrawal will not cause you to exceed the limits specified in
SECTION X
. LIMITS
or limitations you set on the Super.com Deposit Account by using the Super.com App or the Site. Your Available Balance reflects the funds in your Deposit Account that are immediately available for use. The Available Balance includes any pending transactions that credit your Deposit Account (excluding pending returns), such as ACH direct deposits, but does not include (a) pending charges on your Super.com Deposit Account such as, electronic payments, according to the Processing Order, (b) amount of deposits that are not yet available for withdrawal under
SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
, (c) the outstanding unpaid balance on your Super.com Card, and (d) any Holds on your balance, such as Holds on funds to comply with court orders or other legal requirements. We reserve the right to use a different method in certain states if required by law.
‍
The difference between one-time and recurring transactions.
One-time transactions represent any single transaction, while recurring transactions represent pre-authorized scheduled payments you have authorized by providing your Deposit Account information (such as account and bank routing number) to a merchant for goods or services. We rely on the merchant to code transactions appropriately as recurring or non-recurring.
Cutoff Time
. Online requests to transfer funds to or from your Deposit Account must be received by us by 2:30 PM Eastern Time on a Business Day to be initiated on that Business Day. Online transfer requests received by us after 2:30 PM Eastern Time or on a day that is not a Business Day generally will be initiated on the next Business Day.
‍
Deposit Account Numbers on Fund Transfers
. If you instruct us to send a fund transfer, such as an ACH transfer, we, our service providers, and every other bank involved in the transfer may rely on any bank routing number or Deposit Account number you provide. If the fund transfer instruction gives both a bank routing number or number and a name, and the name identifies a different person from the bank or account owner identified by number, we and other banks that handle the fund transfer may still rely exclusively on the number. We have no duty to detect any inconsistency between the bank routing number or Deposit Account number and the name.
‍
Rules for ACH Transfers
. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association rules, such as the Nacha Rules. These rules provide, among other things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional until final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank or payment is otherwise made. If we receive a payment order to credit your Super.com Deposit Account, we are not required to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.
PERSON TO PERSON TRANSFERS.
‍
You may use your Super.com Deposit Account to make person-to-person transfers to other Super.com users.
‍
Payment Authorization
. When you authorize a P2P Transfer, you authorize us to debit your Deposit Account for the amount you request to send on or after the date of your authorization. We will send that amount to your designated recipient. By authorizing a P2P Transfer, you also authorize us to initiate any other transactions necessary to correct errors or reverse payments that are rejected or returned. You may not use an external bank account or any other payment method to fund a P2P Transfer. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have sufficient funds in your Deposit Account necessary to complete any payments initiated through the P2P Transfer service, and that the transaction will not cause you to exceed your balance or any other limits imposed on your Super.com Deposit Account. You agree to reimburse us for any fees, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of insufficient or unavailable funds in connection with any P2P Transfer you initiate.
‍
Restrictions on P2P Transfers to Super.com Users Without a Super.com Deposit Account.
We do not permit a P2P Transfer to a recipient who does not have a Super.com Deposit Account. To send a P2P Transfer, you must provide the recipient’s valid mobile telephone number, which is capable of receiving SMS or “text messages”.
‍
Transaction Limits
. You may not make any transaction that would cause you to exceed any transaction limits set forth in
SECTION X
. LIMITS
. We may reject or reverse any transaction that would cause you or the recipient of the P2P Transfer to exceed your Available Balance, or other limits applicable to their Super.com Deposit Account or User Account, or if we determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Transfer was invalid for any reason. The P2P Transfer service may not be used to conduct business, commercial or merchant transactions. We reserve the right to change these transaction limitations at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice to you, unless required by law.
Stop Payment
. P2P Transfer requests are likely to be processed as soon as we receive them, and therefore, we may be unable to stop P2P Transaction requests. It is your responsibility to confirm the details of your P2P Transfer request prior to providing authorization to us for the P2P Transfer. If you would like to make a P2P Stop Payment request, understanding that we may not be able to satisfy this request, please contact finproductssupport@super.com.
‍
Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks
. P2P Transfers may be invalidated or reversed by us if, among other reasons, we send cash or credit to you or your recipient in error, the funding transaction is declined or reversed, the P2P Transfer was unauthorized or unfunded, or the P2P Transfer was made for activities or reasons that violate this Agreement, the Super.com Terms of Use or any other agreement you have with us. If a P2P Transfer is invalidated for any reason, you may be liable to us for the full amount of the P2P Transfer, and we may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer (plus applicable fees, if any) from you. We may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer from the sender or recipient of the P2P Transfer in our sole discretion (subject to applicable law). When recovering the amount of an invalidated P2P Transfer from you, we may apply any funds sent to you in a subsequent P2P Transfer, from your Super.com Deposit Account or any incoming deposit to your Deposit Account, engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you, place a limitation or restriction on your Super.com Deposit Account, or take any other action authorized by the Agreement, or any other agreement you have with us.
‍
P2P Public Profile
. You may create a profile that is viewable and searchable by others to make P2P Transfers. The profile may include a picture, personal information, and transaction information. You are responsible for the content that you upload or add to the profile. The content that you upload or add to the profile will be used, shared, and stored in accordance with the Super.com Privacy Policy.
‍
P2P Requests
. You may use the P2P Transfer service to request payments from your friends and family. When you do so, the Super.com App or the Site will automatically generate a draft text message on your smartphone’s texting feature, to send to the intended recipient. The text message will contain a unique link which the recipient can use to access a payments portal and make a payment to your Super.com Deposit Account, using an accepted payment method. The Super.com App or the Site does not automatically send the text message and requires the person making the request to send the auto-generated message, using the recipient’s valid mobile phone number. The message may be edited, but the unique link may not be changed. If the person who receives the request successfully makes a payment using the unique link, the amount of the payment received will be deposited as cash into your Deposit Account. The recipient of the message is not required to respond to the request for payment, may choose to send a different amount of money than the amount requested, or choose not to respond or send you any money.
YOU MAY NEVER REQUEST A PAYMENT FROM ANYONE YOU DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY OR MAKE ANY UNSOLICITED REQUESTS FOR MONEY.
Your and your recipient’s mobile or data carrier may charge a fee to send and receive these text messages. We are not responsible for these fees.

You further agree to hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from losses arising out of actions taken or omitted in good faith by any Indemnified Party in reliance upon instructions from you. The Indemnified Parties are not responsible for any actions or omissions by any third party. If you give us instructions that we believe may expose us to potential liability, we may refuse to follow your instructions and we will not be liable to you if we refuse to follow your instructions. If we do choose to follow your instructions, we may ask you for certain protections such as a surety bond or an indemnity agreement in a form that is satisfactory to us. This section will survive termination of your Super.com Deposit Account and termination of this Agreement.

Filing a Lawsuit or Arbitration
. You must file any lawsuit or arbitration against the Indemnified Parties within two years after the cause of action arises, unless federal or state law or an applicable agreement provides for a shorter time. This limit is in addition to limits on notice as a condition to making a claim. If applicable state law does not permit contractual shortening of the time during which a lawsuit must be filed to a period as short as two years, you and we agree to the shortest permitted time under that state’s laws. We abide by applicable federal and state record retention laws and may dispose of any records that we retained or preserved for the period set forth in these laws. Any action against us or another Indemnified Party must be brought within the period that the law requires us to preserve records, unless applicable law or this Agreement provides a shorter limitation period or applicable law requires a longer limitation period.

-
Judgment Interest Rate
. If either you or we are awarded a judgment against the other in connection with your Super.com Deposit Account, the rate of interest earned before judgment on the judgment amount will be the rate of interest your Deposit Account earned during that period unless state law requires a different rate.

Unlawful Internet Gambling Notice
. Restricted transactions, as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG, are prohibited from being processed through this Super.com Deposit Account or relationship. Restricted transactions generally include those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful Internet gambling.
‍
Severability
. Any provision of this Agreement that limits the Bank’s liability does not negate the Bank’s duty (if any) under applicable law to act in good faith and with ordinary care. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to limit the Bank’s liability in a way prohibited by applicable law, or to be otherwise unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such provision with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified.
‍
Death or Incompetence.
We may continue to honor your instructions until: (a) we know of your death or adjudication of incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that we may pay or certify transactions made on or before the date of death or adjudication of incompetence for up to ten (10) days after your death or adjudication of incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the Super.com Deposit Account.
‍
Power of Attorney
. A power of attorney is a document you sign authorizing someone else, called your agent, to act on your behalf. If you sign a power of attorney, the agent can sign on your behalf and do anything you could do regarding your Super.com Deposit Account, including withdrawing or spending all of the money in your Deposit Account. Do not sign a power of attorney unless you trust the agent to act in your best interest. If you choose to add an agent, you must provide a power of attorney form that we agree to accept. We may rely on a copy of an original power of attorney. We are not required to investigate the facts relating to any power of attorney provided to us on your behalf, including whether your signature on the power of attorney is authentic or whether the agent continues to have authority. We may follow or refuse to follow the agent’s instructions at any time, including if we suspect fraud or abuse on your Super.com Deposit Account, unless applicable law requires otherwise. We may also refuse an agent’s request to become a joint owner or a beneficiary of a Super.com Deposit Account, but we have no liability to anyone if we do so. We have no liability when we follow or refuse to follow any instructions from an agent, for example, if your agent misuses the authority you have given them.
‍
Representative Payee Accounts
. If you open an Deposit Account as a representative payee for someone who receives social security payments, or as a legal custodian, spouse payee, or other custodian for someone who receives Veterans Administration payments, you agree not to permit any deposits to the account other than the designated payments. We are not required to determine whether you deposit other funds or whether any withdrawals or transfers from the account are for the support of the person for whose benefit the funds are paid.
‍
International and Foreign Exchange Transactions
. We generally do not permit international transactions or transactions in foreign currency on your Super.com Deposit Account. All transactions will be processed in U.S. dollars. If we permit you to make an international transaction or transaction in foreign currency, any applicable exchange rate applied to transactions that occur in a different currency will be selected by us, our service provider, or by the network that processes the transaction. We, our service provider, or the network will select from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets or a rate mandated by the government that issues or controls the currency in that country on the date in which the transaction is processed. The date on which the transaction processes from which the exchange rate is applied may differ from the date you used your Deposit Account. The exchange rate we may use may include a spread, commission or other costs that we, our affiliates or vendors charge in providing for an exchange to you. The exchange rate may vary among customers depending on the type of transaction being conducted, the dollar amount, the currency involved, and the date and the time of the exchange. You should expect these rates will be less favorable than rates quoted online or in publications.
‍
Escheatment/Abandonment
. If your Deposit Account is closed, we will return any balance, less any fees, claims, set-offs, or other amounts which may be applied against your balance. Funds that cannot be returned or transferred may be considered abandoned under the jurisdiction in which you reside. Each state has its own laws that govern escheatment and when we are required to send a customer’s funds to that state.

DETERMINING THE AVAILABILITY OF YOUR DEPOSIT

If you make a deposit before 2:30 PM Eastern Time on a Business Day, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after 2:30PM Eastern Time on a Business Day, or, on a day that is not a Business Day, we will consider the deposit made on the next Business Day. Funds are available in your Super.com Deposit Account as described below.

Please read this document carefully and retain it for future reference.

For security reasons, your Super.com Deposit Account is subject to limits on the number, amount, frequency, and type of deposits and withdrawals. To protect the security of your Super.com Deposit Account, others’ accounts, and our systems, we may or may not disclose some or any of these limits or any changes to these limits unless required by applicable law. We may change these limits from time to time at our sole discretion with or without notice. We will notify you of any limits or changes to the limits as required by applicable law. In our discretion, we may from time to time permit you to make transactions in excess of these limits, but permission to exceed a transaction limit on one or more occasion(s) does not grant or guarantee future right or permission to exceed the transaction limits.

Managing Your Super.com Deposit Account Balance
.
You agree that the amount of any EFT transaction you authorize to debit your Deposit Account will not exceed the Available Balance in your Deposit Account used to make the transaction, or any other limits imposed on your Super.com Deposit Account. We may in our sole discretion choose to permit an EFT that would create an overdraft in your Deposit Account.

You may choose instead to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.
‍
Our Refusal to Pay a Preauthorized or Other Regular (Automatic) Debit.
We reserve the right to refuse to pay a regular (automatic) debit, for example, if your Deposit Account has insufficient funds to cover such transfer or if we are unable to verify the ownership of or other information about the account to which the funds will be transferred.

You are responsible for maintaining ownership of the mobile device associated with the phone number and security of your other Access Devices.

. You may tell us by calling us at +1 (844) 461-2577 or by writing to us as soon as possible at finproductssupport@super.com (or such other address as we may provide to you from time to time).
Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down.
You could lose all the money in your Deposit Account. If you tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Access Device or device, your liability will be limited to fifty dollars ($50) if someone accesses your Deposit Account without your permission.
If you DO NOT tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Access Device , and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Access Device or device without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as five hundred dollars ($500).
Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us AT ONCE. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was delivered to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
If you grant authority to make transfers to another person who exceeds the authority granted, you are fully liable for any transfers until you notify us that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.

If we need more time, however, we may take up to forty-five (45) days to investigate your complaint or question.

If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) Business Days, we may not credit your Deposit Account.
For errors involving new Super.com Deposit Accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to ninety (90) days to investigate your complaint or question.

Right of Setoff/Security Interest
‍
We may take or setoff funds in any or all of your accounts with us for direct, indirect and acquired obligations that you owe us, regardless of the source of funds in an Account. This provision does not apply to IRA or tax-qualified retirement accounts, to consumer credit card obligations (except to the extent the credit card issuer lawfully exercises a security interest in your account or its proceeds securing repayment of the credit card obligations ), or where otherwise prohibited by law. Your accounts include both accounts you own individually and accounts you own jointly with others. Our setoff rights are in addition to other rights we have under this Agreement to take or charge funds in your Deposit Account for obligations you owe us. If the law imposes conditions or limits on our ability to take or setoff funds in your accounts, to the extent that you may do so by contract, you waive those conditions and limits and you authorize us to apply funds in any or all of your accounts with us to obligations you owe us. Some government payments may be protected from attachment, levy or other legal process under federal or state law. If such protections apply, to the extent that you may do so by contract, you waive these protections and agree that we may take or setoff funds, including federal and state benefit payments, from your accounts to pay fees, and other obligations you owe us.We may use funds held in your joint accounts to repay obligations on which any account owner is liable, whether jointly with another or individually. We may use funds held in your individual accounts to repay your obligations to us, whether owed by you individually or jointly with another, including: obligations owed by you arising out of another joint account of which you are a joint owner, even if the obligations are not directly incurred by you; obligations on which you are secondarily liable; and any amounts for which we become liable to any governmental agency or department or any company as a result of recurring payments credited to any of your accounts after the death, legal incapacity or other termination of entitlement of the intended recipient of such funds. If you are a sole proprietor, we may charge any of your personal or business accounts.If we take or setoff funds from a time deposit account, we may charge an early withdrawal penalty on the funds withdrawn. We may take or setoff funds from your account before we pay Checks or other Items drawn on the account. We are not liable to you for dishonoring Items where our action results in your account not having enough money to pay Checks and other Items.If you owe a debt to us or any of our affiliates (either now or in the future), you grant us a security interest in all your accounts to secure the debt. Debts include any fees you owe, as well as amounts owed us by another person or entity if you have guaranteed that you will pay their debts. If the debt is due or overdue, we may use the funds in any of your accounts to pay all or part of the debt. If your account is a joint account, we may use the funds in the joint account to pay the debt of any a ccount owner. Our security interest will be governed by Uniform Commercial Code Article 9, whether Article 9 applies by its terms or not. We do not have to give you any prior notice to apply the funds. You expressly agree that our rights extend to any electronically deposited federal or state benefit payments (including Social Security benefits). If you don’t want your benefits applied in this way, you may change your direct deposit instructions at any time with the person or organization paying the benefits. If any federal benefits or other payments are deposited to your Deposit Account after you become ineligible to receive them, we may set off against any of your accounts to recover the payments if we’re obligated to return funds to the payor. This security interest is in addition to our right of setoff against your Account. This section does not limit or reduce our rights under applicable law to charge or setoff funds in your Account with us for direct, indirect and acquired obligations you owe us.

You agree that if you have a dispute, claim, or controversy (collectively, “Claim”) that has arisen or may arise between you and the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach), your Super.com Deposit Account and services provided under this Agreement, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, including any transaction or attempted transaction no matter the method or means, and you are not able to resolve the Claim informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the Claim will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
. “Claim” has the broadest possible meaning, and includes initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims. Among other things, it includes Claims based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud, constitutional law, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for injunctive or declaratory relief).
‍
Parties Subject to this Arbitration Agreement

Arbitration Agreement
applies whenever there is a Claim between you (including your heirs, successors, representatives and beneficiaries) and us. If a third party, such as an Indemnified Party other than the Bank, is also involved in a Claim between you and us, or if a dispute arises between you and an Indemnified Party other than the Bank relating to this Agreement or your Super.com Deposit Account (including any additional, updated, or substitute account for the same accountholder(s)), then the Claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, in accordance with this
Arbitration Agreement
, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party.

‍
Exclusions
You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so failing will bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration. Further, this
Arbitration Agreement
does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. In addition, the following will not be the subject of this
Arbitration Agreement
: (a) the exercising of any self-help rights, including set-off; (b) any action in court by that is limited to preventing the other party from using a self-help remedy, so long as it is prosecuted individually, and does not involve a request for damages or monetary relief of any kind; or (c) any other claims where arbitration is prohibited by law. Further, nothing herein shall prevent either you or us from applying to any court of competent jurisdiction for emergency provisional relief, such as a temporary restraining order, a temporary protective order, an attachment or any other pre-judgment remedies.

Arbitration Agreement
in a timely and proper fashion.

ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
‍
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
‍
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at finproductssupport@super.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the Claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received at the Notice Address, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank or Indemnified Party is entitled.
‍
Arbitration Procedures
‍
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances or by Zoom or video/telephonic conference. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
Costs of Arbitration
‍
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) or less, at your request, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. You will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees, except that the arbitrator shall be entitled to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party in the arbitration if permitted by applicable law.
‍
Governing Law
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
involves interstate commerce and shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) to the fullest extent possible, notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, regardless of the origin or nature of the Claims at issue. The arbitrator must apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and claims of privilege recognized at law. Any Claims and defenses that can be asserted in court can be asserted in the arbitration. The arbitrator may award any remedy provided by the substantive law that would apply if the action were pending in court, including, without limitation, punitive damages (which shall be governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the courts) and injunctive, equitable and declaratory relief. The arbitrator shall follow the law and shall not be entitled to make errors of law. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the award.
‍
Arbitration Result and Right of Appeal
‍
Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Except as provided in applicable statutes, the arbitrator’s award is not subject to review by the court and it cannot be appealed, provided, however, that either party may appeal to any court with jurisdiction to the extent the arbitrator makes an error of law.
‍
Rules of Interpretation.
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
shall survive the closing of the Super.com Deposit Account, any legal proceeding and any bankruptcy to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this
Arbitration Agreement
, on the one hand, and the applicable arbitration rules or the other provisions of this Agreement, on the other hand, this
Arbitration Agreement
shall govern to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
‍
Confidentiality
‍
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
‍
Severability
‍
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to Claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Super.com Deposit Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).

How We Will Calculate Your Balance.
If we charge interest on your Card Balance, we will use the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” method to calculate the balance. To get the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” we take the beginning balance on the Card each day of the billing cycle, add any new purchases and any fees, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us a daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for each day in the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance (including new purchases).

‍
Preauthorizations.
If you use your Card at an automated fuel dispenser (“pay at the pump”), the merchant may pre-authorize the transaction amount up to seventy five dollars ($75.00) or more. If your Card is declined even though you have sufficient Available Credit, pay for your purchase inside with the cashier. If you use your Card at a restaurant, a hotel, or for similar purchases, the merchant may pre-authorize the transaction amount for the purchase amount plus up to twenty percent (20%) or more to ensure there are sufficient funds available to cover tips or incidental expenses incurred. Any pre-authorization amount will place a “hold” on your Available Credit in that amount until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of your purchase. Once the final payment amount is received, the pre-authorization amount on hold will be removed. It may take up to seven (7) Business Days or more for the hold to be removed. During the hold period, you will not have access to the pre-authorization amount. If you authorize a transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of Available Credit for up to thirty (30) calendar days or more.
‍
‍
Declined Transactions.
We may decline to authorize any transaction for any reason at our sole discretion. We are not responsible for any losses you incur if we do not authorize a transaction.

We are not liable for any losses that may result when our services are unavailable due to reasons beyond our control, subject to applicable law.
‍
‍

ATM transactions are treated as cash advance transactions which draw from the line of credit associated with your Card Account. It is not a withdrawal of cash from your Super.com Deposit Account. It is an extension of credit that must be repaid in accordance with this Charge Card Agreement. Any cash advance from an ATM terminal will be subject to any limitations set forth herein and the fees disclosed in the Truth in Lending Disclosures above, as well as any daily limits imposed by the ATM owner. You should not write your PIN on your Super.com Card or keep your PIN with your Super.com Card. Never share your PIN with anyone. When entering your PIN, be sure it cannot be observed by others, and do not enter your PIN into any terminal that appears to be modified or suspicious. If you believe that anyone has gained unauthorized access to your PIN, call us immediately.

LIMITS ON YOUR SUPER.COM CARD AND CARD ACCOUNT
‍
‍
Your Super.com Card has limits that are designed to help you spend no more than you are able to repay. The following limits apply to your use of your Card Account. You may not make any transactions that would cause you to exceed any of these limits. We will never authorize a transaction on your Card in an amount that exceeds the Available Balance in your Super.com Deposit Account. The Available Balance is the most up-to-date record of the amount of money immediately available for use or withdrawal in your Super.com Deposit Account that secures your obligations under this Charge Card Agreement. The Available Balance in your Super.Com Deposit Account, at any given time, is generally equal to the amount deposited into your Super.com Account less your Card Balance. Please see the Deposit Agreement governing your Super.com Deposit Account for more information on how we calculate your Available Balance and how funds are made available to you. This limit is designed to help you spend no more than you are able to repay using the funds in your Super.com Deposit Account. We will never authorize a transaction on your Super.com Card in an amount that exceeds your Available Credit. At any given time, your Available Credit is equal to the lesser of (a) the Available Balance in your Super.com Deposit Account or (b) the Credit Limit minus the unpaid Payment Due on the Super.com Card.
Your Credit Limit is five thousand dollars ($5,000)
. However, your Available Credit can change at any time; for example, when you make a deposit to your Super.com Deposit Account, make a transaction on your Card Account, or repay your Card Balance.
‍
‍
Keeping Track of Your Limits.
You can use the Super.com App, the Site, or contact customer service to view limit and balance information about our Super.com Card. While we do our best to provide the most up-to-date information about your Card Account, there may be some delay in reflecting new transactions, for reasons outside our control, such as network interruptions or delays by merchants in posting transactions, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information in the Super.com App, on the Super.com website, or by phone. You are responsible for keeping track of your Super.com Card Balance, Credit Limit, and Available Credit. Our general practice is to decline transactions that may cause you to exceed your Credit Limit or Available Credit. If we do honor these transactions, you are responsible for paying us back in full immediately, and these limits will not increase. We may increase or decrease your Credit Limit or Available Credit at any time, in our sole discretion. We are not required to extend credit up to your maximum Credit Limit, if it would cause you to exceed your Available Credit
‍
.
Effect of Payment on Credit Limit and Available Credit.
When we receive a payment and apply it to your Card Account from the Super.com Deposit Account associated with your Card Account, your Available Balance in the Super.com Deposit Account will be reduced by the amount of your payment, and your Available Credit on the Super.com Card will not increase.
‍
‍
Exceeding Your Limits.
If you make a transaction that causes you to exceed the Credit Limit or Available Credit on your Card Account, you agree to immediately make a payment on your Card or make a deposit to your Super.com Account such that you no longer exceed your Credit Limit or Available Credit. Our general practice is to decline any transaction that would cause you to exceed any limit applicable to your Super.com Card. Even if we have permitted you to exceed a limit before, we are not required to do it in the future. We determine the amount of your Available Balance for the purpose of deciding whether a transaction will cause you to exceed a limit only once per transaction, which determination may occur at any time between the time you authorize the transaction and when we decline the transaction or send a notice of the declined transaction.
‍
‍
Other Limits.
For security reasons, there are limits on the number, amount, frequency, and type of transactions you can make using your Super.com Card. Similarly, there are limits on your ability to use your Super.com Card with certain merchants or terminals. To protect the security of your Super.com Card, others’ accounts, and our systems, we may or may not disclose some or any of these limits or any changes to these limits unless required by applicable law. We may change these limits from time to time at our sole discretion with or without notice. We will notify you of any limits or changes to the limits as required by applicable law. In our discretion, we may from time to time permit you to make transactions in excess of these limits, but permission to exceed a transaction limit on one or more occasion(s) does not grant or guarantee future right or permission to exceed the transaction limits. Your rights under this Charge Card Agreement to make purchases, initiate transfers, and complete other transactions with your Super.com Card or Card Account are subject to this paragraph.
‍
‍
PURCHASE ASSURANCE
You may enable the Purchase Assurance feature at any time within the Super.com App or on the Site. This feature will not be available unless you have enabled it. If you attempt to make a purchase with your Super.com Card that exceeds the Available Credit applicable to your Card, and you have attached an external debit card (“
Linked Debit Card
”) to your Super.com Deposit Account, Super.com may, as a convenience to you and in its sole discretion, transfer the funds into your Super.com Deposit Account from your Linked Debit Card to cover the purchase (“
Purchase Assurance
”). When you access the Purchase Assurance feature, Super.com will transfer the amount necessary for you to make your purchase to your Super.com Deposit Account from your Linked Debit Card on file with us. Once you have elected to enable Purchase Assurance, you may subsequently revoke your authorization in the Super.com App or on the Site, or by calling our Customer Support Team at +1 (844) 461-2577 at least three (3) Business Days before the date of any Super.com Card transaction you make which would access the Purchase Assurance feature. There will be no fee for the first three (3) Purchase Assurance transfers in any given calendar month, and every transaction thereafter will generally be declined, however we will not charge a fee and we are not liable if we do not decline it. Purchase Assurance only is available when enabled and up to the amount of funds that are available in your Linked Debit Card. If you attempt to make a purchase which exceeds the amount of funds available in your Linked Debit Card, the transaction will be declined. By electing to enable Purchase Assurance, you authorize us to debit and/or credit your Linked Debit Card we have on file for you, every day, when you use the Purchase Assurance feature to complete a purchase using your Super.com Card, on or promptly after each date you authorize the Super.com Card transaction. The amount of each debit will be the amount needed to complete the transaction(s) you make on your Super.com Card; meaning, Super.com will transfer the difference of the transaction amount and your Available Credit. You acknowledge that, as applicable, the electronic authorization contained in this Section represents your written authorization for debit card transactions as provided herein and will remain in full force and effect until you notify us that you wish to revoke this authorization as described above. NOTE: Purchase Assurance entails transferring the difference of your Available Credit and the transaction amount in order to complete a Super.com Card purchase transaction. By way of example, if you have enrolled in Purchase Assurance and you currently have $10 of Available Credit on your Super.com Card, and you initiate a Super.com Card purchase transaction for $17, a transfer of $7 will be initiated from your Linked Debit Card to your Super.com Deposit Account at or around the time that the transaction is authorized in order to approve the Super.com Card purchase transaction.
‍
‍
PAYMENTS, INTEREST AND FEES
‍
Your Promise to Pay
. You promise to pay us all amounts due on your Super.com Card by each Payment Due Date set forth on each Statement. Amounts due on your Super.com Card will include amounts where you may not have signed a purchase slip or other document for the transaction. We will treat transactions made without presenting a physical Super.com Card (such as transactions completed by mail, telephone, Internet, or mobile device) the same as if you used the Super.com Card in person. If you let someone else use your Super.com Card, you are responsible for all transactions that person makes, even if that person’s use exceeds their authority to use your Card Account or Super.com Card, whether or not you have notified us that the person will be using your Card Account. If you are responsible for paying any Payment Due, we may refuse to release you from liability until all of the Cards and other credit devices outstanding under the Card Account have been returned to us and you repay us the total Payment Due owed to us under the terms of this Charge Card Agreement.
‍
‍
Prepayment
. You may pay all or any part of your total outstanding Card Balance at any time without a prepayment penalty. If you overpay, or if there is a credit balance on your Card Account, we will not pay interest on such amounts.
Fees
. We will charge fees as disclosed in the Truth in Lending Disclosures, including “Fees” above, subsequent disclosures, Statements, and any change in terms or notices. If you miss a required payment by the Payment Due Date, we will exercise our security interest in the funds in your Super.com Deposit Account, and we may terminate your Super.com Card and your Super.com Deposit Account. See the Security Agreement below for more details.
‍
‍
Other Fees
. Unless prohibited by law, we also may charge you other fees from time to time for services you request that are otherwise not captured here. If a fee applies to your Card Account, we will tell you the amount of the fee at the time you request the service.
‍
‍
Payment Methods
. You are permitted only to make payments to your Super.com Card from your Super.com Deposit Account. You must use one of the following payment methods:
Preauthorized Automatic Payments (“Autopay”)
. When you sign up, or by using the Super.com App or Site, you may elect to make payments for your Super.com Card using Autopay. Upon selecting Autopay, you authorize us to make recurring debits from your Super.com Deposit Account on each Auto Payment Date to satisfy the Payment Due set forth on each Statement. We will not debit more than the Payment Due. However, the amount we debit may be less than the Payment Due because payments, returned purchases, and other credits can reduce the Payment Due if they post to the Card Account between the Statement Date and the Auto Payment Date. You also authorize us to debit or credit your selected payment method as needed to correct any errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
‍
One-Time Transfer
. You may use the Super.com App or Site to authorize us to make a one-time transfer to us from your Super.com Deposit Account to pay the amount of the Payment Due as set forth on your Statement.

‍
We may permit additional payment methods from time to time. We may reject any payment not made in accordance with this section.You must make payments in U.S. dollars in a form acceptable to us. We do not accept cash payments through the mail or by check. When making a payment, you must follow the instructions in this section and any additional instructions shown on your Statement. If you do not follow our payment instructions, we may not accept your payment, or there may be a delay in crediting your Card Account. If you make a one-time payment after the cut-off time of 2:30pm Eastern Time on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, it will be initiated as of the next Business Day. Our Business Days are Monday through Friday, except for federal holidays. We may accept and process payments without losing any of our rights under this Charge Card Agreement.
‍
‍
How We Apply Your Payments
. Payments are first applied to any past-due amount, then to your current Payment Due. We may adjust your Available Balance, Available Credit, or Credit Limit as reasonably necessary to correct errors, process returned and reversed payments, and address other similar issues.
‍
‍
Credit Balances
. We may reject and return any payment that creates or adds to a credit balance on your Super.com Card Account. Any credit balance we allow will not be available until we confirm that your payment has cleared. We may reduce the amount of any credit balance by any new charges. You may write to the address provided on your Statement to request a refund of any available credit balance.
‍
‍
Non-Payment
. In addition to any other rights we may have or actions we may take under this Charge Card Agreement, if you fail to pay your Payment Due on the Payment Due Date, we may exercise the Security Interest in the Collateral under the
Security Agreement

Security Agreement
section below.

TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND/OR WITH MERCHANTS LOCATED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

The conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date that appears on your Statement. We do not adjust the currency exchange rate or charge any currency conversion fees. However, we, Mastercard, or our respective service providers may earn money on the currency conversion.
‍
‍
STATEMENTS AND RECEIPTS
We generally will send or make available to you one Statement for your Card Account at the end of each billing cycle. The Statement will show the activity on your Card Account during the billing cycle and will tell you the New Balance, the Payment Due, and the Payment Due Date of your next payment. All Transactions that post to your Card Account after the closing date of your Statement will appear on your next Statement. Please review each Statement carefully. Preservation of your rights under federal law regarding resolution of billing errors depends upon your timely recognition of potential errors, as explained below in the “Your Billing Rights” section of this Charge Card Agreement. Under certain circumstances, the law may not require us to send or make available to you a Statement, or may prohibit us from doing so. If an event of default occurs under this Charge Card Agreement, we may, in our sole discretion, stop sending you Statements if we deem your Card Account uncollectible or if we institute delinquency collection proceedings.You may obtain receipts to maintain a record of your transactions. You may need a receipt in order to verify a transaction with us or the merchant.

Prohibition and Waiver of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
‍
‍
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE BANK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
‍
Prohibition and Waiver of Court and Jury Trials
FOR CLAIMS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY DECIDE THE CLAIM. ALSO, YOUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM US MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN AN ARBITRATION THAN IN A LAWSUIT. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at finproductssupport@super.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“
Notice
”). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (“
Notice Address
”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the Claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received at the Notice Address, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank or Indemnified Party is entitled.
‍
‍
Arbitration Procedures
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“
AAA
”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Charge Card Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Charge Card Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances or by Zoom or video/telephonic conference. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
‍
Costs of Arbitration
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “
Arbitration Fees
”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) or less, at your request, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. You will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees, except that the arbitrator shall be entitled to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party in the arbitration if permitted by applicable law.
‍
‍
Governing Law
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
involves interstate commerce and shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (the “
FAA
”) to the fullest extent possible, notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, regardless of the origin or nature of the Claims at issue. The arbitrator must apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and claims of privilege recognized at law. Any Claims and defenses that can be asserted in court can be asserted in the arbitration. The arbitrator may award any remedy provided by the substantive law that would apply if the action were pending in court, including, without limitation, punitive damages (which shall be governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the courts) and injunctive, equitable and declaratory relief. The arbitrator shall follow the law and shall not be entitled to make errors of law. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the award.
‍
‍
Arbitration Result and Right of Appeal
‍
Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Except as provided in applicable statutes, the arbitrator’s award is not subject to review by the court and it cannot be appealed, provided, however, that either party may appeal to any court with jurisdiction to the extent the arbitrator makes an error of law.
‍
‍
Rules of Interpretation.
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
shall survive the closing of the Card Account, any legal proceeding and any bankruptcy to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this
Arbitration Agreement
, on the one hand, and the applicable arbitration rules or the other provisions of the Charge Card Agreement, on the other hand, this
Arbitration Agreement
shall govern to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
‍
‍
Confidentiality
‍
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
‍
Severability
‍
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to Claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
Notwithstanding any provision in this Charge Card Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Card Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Charge Card Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Charge Card Agreement).

Super.com Cashback Addendum
This Addendum to the Super.com Secured Credit Card Agreement (this “Addendum”) pertaining to the Super.com Card cashback rewards program (the “Super.com Cashback Program” or the “Program”) is between you and Republic Bank & Trust Company, Member FDIC (“Bank,” or “Republic Bank” and, together with the Bank’s agents, successors, assignees and third-party service providers, “we”, “us,” and “our”).
‍
1. General.
Unless separately defined herein, terms in this Addendum shall have the same meaning as defined in your Super.com Secured Charge Card Agreement (the “Agreement”). The Agreement governs use of the Super.com Card and the Super.com Account, and the Agreement controls with respect to any matters involving the Super.com Card and the Super.com Account; provided, this Addendum will govern in any matter relating exclusively to the Super.com Cashback Program.
‍
‍
For any Super+ Member, the Super.com Account will be automatically enrolled in the Super.com Cashback Program when a Super.com Card is activated or the Super.com Account is used. By activating a Super.com Card or using the Super.com Account, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Addendum. At the sole discretion of Bank, if an enrolled Super.com Card is found to be used in a prohibited manner, Bank may terminate your Program enrollment.
‍
‍
2. How to Earn Super.com Cashback.
“Super.com Cashback” rewards are earned by Super+ Members when purchases are made with your Super.com Card anywhere Mastercard credit cards are accepted in accordance with the following:
‍
The Super.com Account will earn 10% cashback for every dollar spent on hotel booking purchases on the Site or in the Super.com App. Such purchases must be made with your Super.com Card, and Super.com must be the Merchant of Record; and
‍
The Super.com Account will earn 1% cashback for every dollar spent with your Super.com Card on all other credit purchases.
‍
3. Purchase Limitations and Adjustments
. A “purchase” is a charge for goods or services. The following transactions are not considered purchases for purposes of the Super.com Cashback Program and will not earn Super.com Cashback rewards: balance transfers, cash advances, cash-like items, taxes, peer-to-peer transfers, finance charges, unauthorized or fraudulent transactions, and fees of any kind. We reserve the right to determine whether a particular transaction is a qualifying transaction for purposes of what constitutes a purchase for the Program. If a refund or credit to the Super.com Card is initiated in connection with any purchase on which Super.com Cashback rewards were earned, your Super.com Cashback balance will be reduced by the number of Super.com Cashback rewards previously earned in connection with such returned or refunded purchase.
‍
Super.com Cashback will be earned in accordance with the applicable merchant’s categorization of purchases. Please note that merchants self-select the category in which purchases will be identified, and some merchants may be owned by other companies. Therefore, purchase transactions may not be categorized in the manner you expect. We are not responsible for any merchant’s categorization of a purchase.
‍
Purchases that are conducted through online or third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, virtual wallets or similar technology may not be eligible for cashback if the technology does not provide sufficient transaction details for cashback qualification.
‍
Each purchase made on a Super.com Card is eligible for only a single Super.com Cashback reward. Super.com Cashback rewards cannot be combined.
‍
‍
4. Special Offer for New Accounts.
We may offer promotional cashback for new accounts. Individual offers cannot be combined with any other offer or promotion of the Super.com Cashback Program. You will be eligible for only one offer per User Account during the offer period. Some restrictions will apply. The terms for a promotional offer will vary by promotional campaign and can be changed or discontinued at any time without notice. Republic Bank is not associated with any special cashback offers.
‍
‍
5. Terms
.
‍
For so long as you remain a Super+ Member, Super.com Cashback rewards earned will be deposited into the Cardholder’s virtual cashback rewards wallet (the “Rewards Wallet”) daily. Super.com Cashback rewards will be applied to the Super.com Card only after the purchase has fully posted to the cardholder’s Super.com Card. If a purchase remains pending and does not post until after the end of the cardholder’s current billing period, the Cardholder’s Super.com Cashback rewards will be deposited into their Super.com Account at the end of the billing period following the purchase’s full posting to their Super.com Card.
In the event a purchase is returned, canceled or voided after the Super.com Cashback rewards have been deposited into the Cardholder’s Reward Wallet and the Cardholder stops using their Super.com Card or ceases to be a Super+ Member and thus stops accruing Super.com Cashback rewards, Super.com will recover the Super.com Cashback rewards by the following methods: Super.com will first attempt to debit the amount from the Cardholder’s Rewards Wallet (assuming there is an adequate amount within the Rewards Wallet), or if the first option fails and there is an insufficient balance in the Cardholder’s Rewards Wallet, Super.com will debit the previously awarded Super.com Cashback rewards associated with the returned, canceled or voided purchase from the Cardholder’s Super.com Account.
The Cardholder must transfer their cashback from their Rewards Wallet to the Digital Wallet in order for the Super.com Cashback rewards to be available for purchases, subject to the following redemption limitations: $200 daily,  $250 weekly, and $1000 monthly. Negative balances may not be carried in the Rewards Wallet. There is no cap or expiration on Super.com Cashback rewards so long as you remain a Super+ Member and have a Super.com Account. However, should your Super.com Account be closed for any reason, your Cashback rewards will be forfeited. The Cardholder may use the cashback for: (i) Purchases; (ii) Cash Withdrawals; or (iii) Balance Payments.
No Cardholder may access their Rewards Wallet or the Super.com Cashback rewards if their Super.com Card possesses a delinquent status. The Cardholder will be granted renewed access to their Rewards Wallet once their Super.com Card’s delinquency is cured and your Super.com Card is current.
It is your responsibility to regularly monitor your Rewards Wallet and Digital Wallet to ensure that every earning of Cashback rewards and every redemption of such rewards is proper and accurate. It is also your obligation to timely report each and every suspected improper, unauthorized, or inaccurate Cashback rewards earnings, transfer from your Rewards Wallet, or redemption from your Digital Wallet. Timely reporting means no more than sixty (60) days after Cashback rewards earnings are posted to the Rewards Wallet or redemptions are made from your Digital Wallet, respectively.
‍
6. Other Limitations
. We reserve the right to interpret the Program rules and policies, including the provisions of this Addendum, in our sole discretion and will be the final authority on the Super.com Cashback Program. This Addendum, including the percentages of cashback and terms applicable to cashback are subject to change at any time for any reason, at our sole discretion. It is your responsibility to check this Addendum from time to time to understand the cashback rewards applicable to your use of your Super.com Account. Unless or until the Super.com Cashback rewards are redeemed in accordance with this Addendum, you have no right, title, or interest in the earned Super.com Cashback rewards.
‍
‍
7. Termination; Notice of Changes
. We may modify, restrict, cancel, suspend, or terminate the Program at any time without compensation or prior notice to you, except as required by law. In the event the Super.com Cashback Program, your participation in the Program, or the Super.com Account is terminated or canceled by us, earned, but not redeemed Super.com Cashback rewards will be forfeited, except as required by law. All material changes to the Super.com Cashback Program will be reflected in this Addendum and will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Addendum to the Site. You waive any right to receive specific notice of such changes, subject to applicable law.
‍
‍
8. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability
. The Super.com Cashback Program is provided without representation or warranty of any kind, either express or implied, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Neither we, Card Services, nor any other service provider will be liable for any damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, direct, indirect, special, consequential, incidental, punitive damages or any other losses or expenses arising in connection with participation in the Program. You agree to release, discharge and hold harmless us, Super.com, and any other service providers from any and all claims of any sort, type, kind or nature that you may have arising out of or in any way relating to your participation in the Super.com Cashback Program or with respect to any Super.com Cashback rewards, including (but not limited to) claims for or due to personal injury, property damage, accident, sickness, delay, cancellation, postponement, inconvenience, penalty, fines, fees, refunds or other irregularities that may occur, are related to, or that may be caused by or arise out of participation in the Program.

You and Super.com agree that, prior to initiating an arbitration or other legal proceeding, you and Super.com will attempt to negotiate an informal resolution of the Dispute. To begin this process, and before initiating any arbitration or legal proceeding against Super.com, you must send a Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) to the attention of Super.com’s Legal Department at
legalrequests@super.com
. For purposes of these Terms, initiating an arbitration means filing an arbitration demand (“Demand”).
‍
Your Notice to Super.com must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name, address, and the email address associated with your Super.com User Account; (2) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (3) a description of the relief you want, including any money damages you request; and (4) your signature verifying the accuracy of the Notice and, if you are represented by counsel, authorizing Super.com to disclose information about you to your attorney.
‍
After receipt of your Notice, you and Super.com shall engage in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of sixty (60) days, which both sides may extend by written agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Period”). During the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, neither you nor Super.com may initiate an arbitration or other legal proceeding. If the Dispute is not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, you may initiate an individual arbitration as provided below.
‍
Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. Any arbitration must be initiated with and conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) pursuant to its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (together, the “NAM Rules”), except as modified by these Terms. The NAM Rules are available at
www.NAMADR.org
. In any instance where the applicable NAM Rules and these Terms are inconsistent, these Terms shall control. An arbitration Demand filed with NAM must include a certification signed by the filing party verifying compliance with the Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification requirements and other requirements set out in this Section. If NAM fails or declines to conduct the arbitration for any reason, we will mutually select a different arbitration administrator. If we cannot agree, a court will appoint the arbitration administrator. Any arbitration hearing will take place in or nearest to the county or municipality where you live, unless you and Super.com agree to a different location or to a virtual hearing. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement, except that only a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in these Terms (and not an arbitrator) shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver set forth in these Terms or the Mass Filing procedures set forth in the Sections below are unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable.
‍
MASS FILING PROCEDURES.
YOU AND SUPER.COM AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF US IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A MASS ARBITRATION.
Super.com’s receipt of one or more Notice(s) of substantially similar claims brought by or on behalf of twenty-five (25) or more claimants (including you) within a sixty (60) day period (“Mass Filing”) shall be subject to the additional procedures set forth below. Claims included in a Mass Filing, if not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, may proceed only in accordance with the procedures set out below, and subject to the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM Mass Filing Rules”, available at
https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/
”) to the extent not contrary to these Terms. If a court determines that any part of this Section is not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim may only proceed individually in court consistent with the remaining Terms.
‍
A. First (Bellwether) Batch. The first batch of up to fifty (50) Demands are the Bellwether Arbitrations. If your claim is included in the Bellwether Arbitrations, you and Super.com shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the initial pre-hearing conference.
‍
‍B. Stay of Filing of Other Claims. If your claim is not among those selected for the Bellwether Arbitrations, your claim cannot be filed until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed in a later stage of this process. No arbitration fees will be assessed on you or Super.com in connection with your claim unless and until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed with NAM.
‍
‍C. Mediation. After the Bellwether Arbitrations are completed, if your claim remains unresolved, you and Super.com agree to mediate your claim along with any other unresolved claims included in the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”). The mediator will be selected according to the procedure set forth in the NAM Rules, and Super.com will pay the mediator’s fees. The Global Mediation shall be completed within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the selection of a mediator, unless extended by written agreement between you and Super.com.
‍
‍D. Election To Proceed in Court. If Global Mediation is not successful in resolving your claim, and one hundred (100) or more claims included in the Mass Filing remain unresolved, you or Super.com may opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim resolved in court consistent with these Terms. You or Super.com must exercise this election within forty-five (45) days of the completion of Global Mediation.
‍
‍E. Sequential Arbitration of Remaining Batches. If neither you nor Super.com opt out of arbitration, another batch of no greater than fifty (50) individuals’ claims will be selected from the Mass Filing, with twenty-five (25) claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than fifty) selected by counsel for claimants and twenty-five (25) claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than fifty) selected by Super.com. If your claim is included in this next batch of fifty (50) claims, your claim will be filed with NAM, and you and Super.com shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the initial pre-hearing conference. The process of batching up to fifty (50) individual claims at a time will continue until the parties resolve all claims included in the Mass Filing. No unbatched claim can proceed to be filed as a Demand until the previous batch has been resolved.
‍
Tolling. For any claim subject to these Mass Filing procedures, any statute of limitations applicable to your claim shall be tolled from the date the Informal Dispute Resolution Period begins until the earlier of (1) the date your arbitration Demand is filed, or (2) the date you or Super.com opts out of arbitration pursuant to these Terms.
‍
Location of Arbitration. Any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, in (a) the county, parish, or province in which you reside; (b) the State of Delaware; (c) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator; or (d) by telephone or videoconference.
‍
Arbitration Costs. Payment of all arbitration filing fees and costs will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules. If you prevail on your claim in arbitration, Super.com will reimburse you for any portion of the arbitration filing fees you paid that exceeded the amount you would have paid to file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to these Terms. If Super.com prevails on your claim in arbitration, and the arbitrator finds that your claim was frivolous or filed in bad faith, the arbitrator may award Super.com reimbursement from you of Super.com’s arbitration filing fees and costs.
‍
‍Offer of Settlement. Super.com may, but is not obligated to, make a written offer to settle your claim at least fourteen (14) days before the arbitration hearing date. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If an award is issued in your favor but is less than Super.com’s settlement offer, the arbitrator may order you to pay the arbitration costs incurred by Super.com after its offer was made, unless otherwise prohibited by the underlying law governing your claim.
‍
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
YOU AND SUPER.COM AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS (WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLAIMANT, OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THIS ALSO MEANS THAT YOU AND SUPER.COM MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY THIRD PARTY.  NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PROVISION OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE IN THESE TERMS, YOU OR SUPER.COM MAY PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-WIDE SETTLEMENT. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND SUPER.COM WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
‍
Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding what is stated in Paragraph 5 of these Terms of Use, if Super.com changes any terms of this Section after the date you first accepted these Terms or any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use, you may reject the new changes to this Section by sending us written notice to
legalrequests@super.com
within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the later of (1) the “Last Updated” date of the Terms of Use you seek to reject or (2) the date of Super.com’s email to you notifying you of such change. Even if you reject a change, you will remain subject to the last version of the Terms of Use you had accepted.
‍
‍Severability. If any portion of this Section is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Section and all other Terms of Use shall continue to be enforceable and valid.

Renewal
UNLESS YOU CANCEL, BY DEFAULT (AND WITH PRIOR NOTICE TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE AGREED UPON MONTHLY OR ANNUAL TERM, AND THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOU AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL TO YOUR LINKED PAYMENT METHOD. UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR NOT AUTO RENEW BASED ON THE PROCESS IN THE MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION SECTION, YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.
Payment
Your Super+ Membership fee will be automatically charged to your linked payment method in USD currency. Super+ Membership fees are payable monthly or annually in advance. When you purchase your Super+ Membership, you'll be charged the membership fee for your first billing cycle on the date of purchase, which activates the monthly or annual renewable Super+ Membership. Unless you cancel, you'll be charged based on the billing date and billing cycle indicated on your “My Account” page when logged into the Site or in the Super.com App. In certain circumstances, your billing date may change; for instance, if we are unable to successfully charge your card for the Super+ Membership fee on a given day (e.g., a Federal holiday or technical failures). If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment for your Super+ Membership fee, Super.com may automatically retry your selected payment method for the full amount or some portion thereof periodically over the course of your billing cycle to help you get back to enjoying the benefits of your membership, and/or may attempt to charge another payment method that we have on file. If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you continue to be declined, you must provide us a new eligible payment method promptly or your Super+ Membership will be canceled effective immediately. Super.com is not responsible for any fees charged by the cardholder's bank including, but not limited to, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, interest charges, foreign exchange fees, cross border fees, and other penalties levied by the cardholder's bank. If you provide us with a new eligible payment method and are successfully charged, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
Cancellation
You may cancel your Super+ Membership any time by calling our Customer Support team at 1 (844) 461-2577. You can also find this information on the Site or the Super.com App if you visit “My Account”. Additionally, if you are a resident of California or New York you may cancel your membership by visiting “My Account” and selecting “Cancel my membership”. If you would like to cancel your Super+ Membership, in order to not be charged on your upcoming billing date as indicated in your “My Account” page on the Super.com App, you must notify Super.com at least three (3) business days before the applicable billing date. If we do not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled billing date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so, and the cancellation will apply for the following billing cycle. All payments are non-refundable and non-transferable, and will not be refunded on a pro-rata basis for any cancellation. In the event of the termination of a Super+ Membership, including free trials or promotional memberships, all associated benefits shall terminate immediately. However, any earned Super+ credits shall be retained.
Limitation of Liability
IN ADDITION TO OTHER LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THESE TERMS OF USE, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE LAST MEMBERSHIP FEE YOU PAID. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND WILL SURVIVE CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP.
REFERRAL PROGRAM
We may offer users the opportunity to participate in programs rewarding users for referring their friends and family members to Super.com (each a “Referral Program”).
‍
We may provide you the opportunity to receive a promotional reward (“Reward”) for taking specific actions, like referring a friend to Super.com. Rewards may be issued as Promotional Credit to your User Account, or by other means we select from time to time. In order to earn Rewards through referrals, you will need to follow the instructions specific to that rewards program. Typically, we will provide you with a unique referral code to share with friends and family that they must enter when they sign up for a User Account or use a particular Service. The amount of Rewards you might earn for a referral, and the amount of cash (if any) for which a Reward may be redeemed, may vary from time to time in our sole discretion. We may offer temporary promotions pursuant to which you may earn a certain amount of Rewards for referrals made during the specified promotional period, and these promotions may be subject to additional terms and conditions that you are required to accept and that are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference. Unless otherwise specified by the terms of a promotion, you may only earn one Reward per User Account opened by a friend you referred to, even if you referred two or more friends who each become owners of the same User Account. You may not earn any Rewards if your User Account is past due, canceled, has a returned payment outstanding, or is otherwise in default. Rewards are issued solely for loyalty, awards, and promotional purposes. You may not use your Rewards for a business or commercial purpose. Rewards have no cash value until and unless Super.com credits your User Account. Rewards are not your property and you cannot transfer Rewards to any other person. Rewards cannot be transferred by operation of law. Rewards remain the property of Super.com until Super.com credits them to your User Account. Super.com reserves the right to decline to credit your User Account for Rewards earned at any time and for any reason, subject to applicable law. If we, in our sole discretion, determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or fraud in connection with earning Rewards or that you attempt to do so, we may take any action, including: (i) revoking any Rewards; (ii) temporarily suspending your ability to earn Rewards or receive a credit for Rewards previously earned; (iii) terminating your participation in the Rewards Program; and/or (iv) canceling your User Account.
‍
We may add to, terminate, and/or change the Referral Program at any time with or without notice to you. You acknowledge that in the event we make these changes, you may no longer be able to earn Rewards. If you or we close your User Account for any reason, we may immediately require you to forfeit all of your ability to earn Rewards. There is no fee to participate in the Referral Program. You are responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes as a result of earning Rewards.
CARD LINKED OFFERS
If you register a payment card in connection with any of the Services, Super.com will collect and/or receive data from third parties relating to transactions with the registered payment card. Transaction data may include limited redemption information for cardholder’s qualifying purchase, such as cardholder ID and associated transaction date/time, transaction amount, and merchant ID. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in other terms or privacy policies, transaction data may be used to monitor transactions on your registered payment card(s) to identify qualifying purchases, determine program eligibility, and operate and analyze the effectiveness of the card link program. Specifically when you register and link a payment card, Mastercard may: (1) monitor activity on your linked payment card(s) to identify qualifying transactions, and may share such transaction details with Super.com to enable your card linked offer(s) and otherwise facilitate your participation in Super.com's program, as set forth in Service Terms and Privacy Policy; and (2) may retrieve and analyze up to thirteen (13) months of prior transaction data history for your enrolled card for the purpose of targeting and assigning marketing offers to you. You may opt-out of transaction monitoring or the program on the payment card(s) you entered at any time through the Site or the Super.com App or by contacting our Customer Advocates. In certain circumstances, we reserve the right to initiate a clawback of cashback granted to users for specific offers previously opted into and for which cashback has already been received.

By using the Super.com Services you are agreeing that we may share some of your personal data with third parties, including our partners. The use of shared data is subject to the applicable third party’s privacy policy.

Personal Data Choices You Have
The personal data that we collect is yours, and so you have choices available to you around what we collect and how it is used. Some of these choices can be communicated to Super.com (such as requesting access to or deletion of your information), and others should be communicated to other parties you engage with (such as in your phone settings for whether or not you share location information, etc.).
‍
You can always choose not to provide personal information such as your name, phone number, shipping address, email address, payment details, etc. However, this may mean that you are unable to complete a hotel booking or purchase products.
‍
Managing Your Information
You may access and update some of your information through your Account settings. If your account is tied to a third-party application, like Facebook or WhatsApp, you can change your settings and remove permission for the app on the third party’s website. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date.
‍
Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information
‍
You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information about you.
‍
Data Access and Portability
‍
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request certain copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
‍
Data Retention and Erasure
‍
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. In certain jurisdictions, you can request to have all your personal information deleted entirely. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
‍
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a Super.com User Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that User Account to prevent that person from opening a new account in the future.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Super.com may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
We may retain some copies of your information (e.g., log records) in our database, but they will be disassociated from personal identifiers.
Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing
If we are processing your personal information based on your consent you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your User Account settings or by sending a communication to Super.com specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant (under Objection to Processing) and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Super.com override your own.
‍
Objection to Processing
‍
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Super.com not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interests. If you object to such processing, Super.com will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
‍
Filing a Request

To request access to, correction of, restriction of, or deletion of any of your personal data and information that we have collected, you can contact us at

Super+ Membership Service Terms
Last Updated: January 7, 2025
IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ THESE TERMS
These Service Terms (these “
Service Terms
”) for the Super+ membership services (“
Super+ Membership
” and, each individual with a Super+ Membership, a “
Super+ Member
”) are between you and Snapcommerce Holdings, Inc. DBA Super.com and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates (“
Super.com,
” “
we
,” and “
our
”). These Service Terms  govern your and our respective rights and obligations. Please note that your use of the Super.com website (the “
Site
”), the Super.com mobile app (the “
Super.com App
”), and Super+ Membership services are also governed by the Super.com Terms of Use (the “
Terms of Use
”), as well as the Service Terms for any specific products and services used in connection with your Super+ Membership, including, without limitation, the Super.com Privacy Policy, the Service Terms and any related agreements relating to the Super.com Travel Services, the Super.com Financial Services (i.e., the Super.com Deposit Account and Super.com Card), and the Super.com Earnings Services (collectively, the “
Additional Terms
”). The Terms of Use and the Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into these Service Terms. If you sign up for a Super+ Membership, you accept these Service Terms, as well as all other terms, conditions, limitations and requirements set forth on our Site or the Super.com Mobile App.
THE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS WELL AS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION, WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST SUPER.COM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW AND WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. READ CAREFULLY, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT, IF APPLICABLE, TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND THAT YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY IN ANY FORUM, AS DESCRIBED IN THE TERMS OF USE.
We may modify these Service Terms for any reason and at any time by posting a new version. Modifications to these Service Terms do not affect any rights or obligations that arose prior to the modifications, but your continued use of the Super+ Membership following the posting of modified Service Terms will be subject to the Service Terms in effect at the time of your use.
Please review these Service Terms periodically for changes.
If you object to any provision of these Service Terms or any subsequent modifications to these Service Terms your only recourse is to immediately terminate use of the Super+ Membership.
Membership Cancellation
You may cancel your Super+ Membership any time by calling our Customer Support team at
1
(877) 376-2710
. You can also find this information on the Site or the Super.com App if you visit “My Account”. Additionally, if you are a resident of California or New York you may cancel your membership by visiting “My Account” and selecting “Cancel my membership”. If you would like to cancel your Super+ Membership, in order to not be charged on your upcoming billing date as indicated in your “My Account” page on the Super.com App, you must notify Super.com at least three (3) business days before the applicable billing date. If we do not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled billing date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so, and the cancellation will apply for the following billing cycle. All payments are non-refundable and non-transferable, and will not be refunded on a pro-rata basis for any cancellation.
In the event of the termination of a Super+ Membership, including free trials or promotional memberships, all associated benefits shall terminate immediately.
Membership Fees, Payment, and Renewal
Fees
Your Super+ Membership fee (your “
Membership Fee
”) is stated in the “My Account” section of the Super.com App. The current Super+ Membership Fee is $15 per month. From time to time, we may change the Membership Fee and/or offer different membership terms. The Super+ Membership fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Service Terms.
Renewal
UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE SERVICE TERMS, YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY (BY DEFAULT AND WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) RENEW FOR THE AGREED UPON MONTHLY OR ANNUAL TERM, AND THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOU AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL TO YOUR LINKED PAYMENT METHOD. UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR NOT AUTO RENEW BASED ON THE PROCESS IN THE MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION SECTION, YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR SUPER+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY LINKED PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.
Payment
Your Super+ Membership Fee will be automatically charged to your linked payment method in USD currency. If all linked payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment for your Super+ Membership Fee, Super.com may automatically retry your selected payment method to help you get back to enjoying the benefits of your membership, and/or may attempt to charge another payment method that we have on file. If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you continue to be declined, you must provide us a new eligible payment method promptly or your Super+ Membership will be canceled effective immediately. Super.com is not responsible for any fees charged by your bank in connection with our attempts to receive payment, including, without limitation, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, interest charges, foreign exchange fees, cross border fees, and other penalties levied by your bank. If you provide us with a new eligible payment method and are successfully charged, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
Billing Cycle
Super+ Membership Fees are payable monthly or annually in advance. When you purchase your Super+ Membership, you'll be charged the Membership Fee for your first billing cycle on the date of purchase, which activates the monthly or annual renewable Super+ Membership. Unless you cancel, you'll be charged based on the billing date and billing cycle indicated on your “My Account” page when logged into the Site or in the Super.com App. In certain circumstances, your billing date may change; for instance, if we are unable to successfully charge your card for the Super+ Membership fee on a given day (e.g., a Federal holiday or technical failures). Super.com may change the monthly or annual fee charged for membership at any time, but any such fee change will not apply to current Super+ Members until such time as their current memberships expire and their memberships are renewed for another term. Where the fee has increased, Super.com will notify you of the relevant fee increase prior to the renewal of your Super+ Membership.
Membership Credit
As a Super+ Member, you will earn Super+ credits (“
Super+ Credits
”
)
to a percentage of every dollar you spend on hotel booking purchases on Super.com, where Super.com is the merchant of record (“
MOR
”). The amount of Super+ Credits will be provided to you at the time of purchase. Super+ Credits shall be accrued and duly recorded in your Super+ Membership account on the later of the following dates: (1) forty-five (45) days from the date of hotel purchase or (2) the date of hotel check-in (“
Earned Date
”). Subject to our sole discretion, Super+ Credits may be granted at an earlier date in cases of promotional or limited offers.
Super+ Members may use Super+ Credits towards Super.com Travel bookings. Super.com must be the MOR for Super+ Credits to be applied toward a hotel booking at the time of purchase. Super+ Members with a Super.com Card (as defined below) can also redeem the Super+ Credits to their Super.com Deposit Account (as defined below), where they can be used towards everyday purchases on the Super.com Card.
PLEASE NOTE: Super+ Credits are rounded up to the nearest penny when the credits amount has a fractional cent at or above five/tenths ($0.005) and down to the nearest penny when below this amount. For example, if the amount of Super+ Credits calculated for a purchase was $3.2549, the Super+ Credits earned would be $3.25. However, if the amount of Super+ Credits calculated for a purchase was $3.2550, the Super+ Credits earned would be $3.26.
If you cancel a reservation made using Super+ Credits within the hotel supplier’s cancellation window, we will return the Super+ Credits to your account within 24 hours of your cancellation. If you cancel a reservation made using Super+ Credits outside of the hotel supplier’s cancellation window, the Super+ Credits will not be returned to your account.
There is a $100 daily, $250 weekly, and $1,000 monthly Super+ Credits redemption limit, when you redeem your Super+ Credits into your Super.com Account. Credits earned by Super+ Members generally expire 12 months after the Earned Date. However, some promotional or other credits may have varying expiration dates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Service Terms, the expiration date of Super+ Credits stated at the time they are offered or earned will control. In order to use them, you must redeem Super+ Credits within 12 months or the stated time period. If you do not redeem your Super+ Credits during their applicable period, your Super+ Credits will expire and will not be reissued.
Other Terms & Limitations
Super+ Credits cannot be used as a form of payment for your Super+ Membership Fee, and no Super+ Credits will be earned for the payment of the Super+ Membership Fee.
Super+ Credits have no cash value, and, except as expressly provided herein, cannot be redeemed for cash, other reward programs, or credits in another currency.
Super+ Credits may be earned and redeemed on transactions made in any currency of payment, but cashback shall be disbursed in the form of USD.
Super+ Credits are non-transferable.
Membership Benefits
The following is a description of Super+ Membership benefits, which are subject to change from time to time at our sole discretion.
Super.com Financial Services
One of the financial products/services offered via our Site or the Super.com App is the Super.com Secured Credit Card (the “
Super.com Card

Access to the Super.com Card is subject to (1) Super.com Deposit Account creation and (2) passing the Super.com Card identification and verification check described in the Super.com Financial Services Service Terms. If you do not pass the identification and verification check, you will maintain access to your Super+ Membership and benefits; however, you will not have use of the Super.com Card and related benefits. If you are approved for a Super.com Deposit Account, Bank Partner may limit or deny (or instruct us to limit or deny) your access to your Super.com Deposit Account and the related services for any reason, subject to applicable law.

Supplementary Cash Advance
Republic Bank and Trust Company is not affiliated with this Service.
In connection with your Super+ Membership, Super.com offers a supplementary cash advance service (“
Supplementary Advance
”). There is no guarantee that you will qualify for a Supplementary Advance. Whether you qualify for a Supplementary Advance and for what amount is determined by a series of factors that may include, among other things, whether you have established a direct deposit into your Super.com Account or linked your Super.com Account to an external bank account or debit card (your “
Payment Method
”), and an analysis of your deposits and transaction history. We reserve the right to adjust Supplementary Advance amounts and our eligibility criteria at any time. Supplementary Advances are not loans, and we do not charge interest for Supplementary Advances, nor do we report repayment (or the failure to repay) or the timing of repayment to any credit bureau.
You may request a Supplementary Advance through our Site or on the Super.com App. You must have a Super.com User Account to request a Supplementary Advance. You may choose to provide tips or other gratuities in appreciation of Supplementary Advances (each a “
Gratuity
”). Options for Gratuities and any other optional fee which may be associated with a Supplementary Advance (collectively “
Voluntary Fees
”) will be presented to you prior to completing a request for a Supplementary Advance. Voluntary Fees are payable on the repayment date for the applicable Supplementary Advance (each a “
Repayment Date
”). In no way does your choice of Voluntary Fees alter your eligibility to receive a Supplementary Advance or the amount of any Supplementary Advance you are eligible to receive.
Our default is to automatically debit your Payment Method on your Repayment Date in an amount equal to the given Supplementary Advance and any associated Voluntary Fees. Super.com has no legal or contractual claim against you for failing to repay a Supplementary Advance, but Super.com will not provide you further Supplementary Advances (i) while any amount of a Supplementary Advance, including any Voluntary Fees associated with such Supplementary Advance, remains unpaid, (ii) if you have a history of late repayment of Supplementary Advances, or (iii) if you otherwise become ineligible for Supplementary Advances under our then-current eligibility criteria. With respect to a failure to repay a Supplementary Advance, Super.com will not engage in any debt collection activities, place the amount owed with or sell to a third party, or report you to a consumer reporting agency. Super.com does not waive any rights regarding fraudulent activity, and Super.com will pursue instances of fraud. Voluntary Fees paid are not refundable.
You may opt-out of our automatic debit of your Payment Method for a given Supplementary Advance by indicating so to a Super.com customer service representative at 1 (877) 376-2710 at least three (3) business days before the applicable Repayment Date.
If you do not have adequate funds in your Payment Method on the applicable Repayment Date and have not opted out of automatic repayment for a Supplementary Advance, we will continue to debit your Payment Method for that Supplementary Advance until it has been repaid.
We are not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, insufficient fund charges, or any other bank fees that result from your failure to maintain a sufficient balance on your Payment Method. We will monitor your balances where possible and attempt to ensure you have sufficient funds before debiting them, but we make no warranties that an overdraft of your Payment Method will not occur when you have inadequate funds to repay a Supplementary Advance on its Repayment Date.
‍
You authorize us to electronically debit your Payment Method on the Repayment Date for the Payment Amount in connection with each and every Supplementary Advance and all Voluntary Fees. As applicable, you also authorize Super.com to electronically debit and credit your Payment Method to correct erroneous debits and credits. You acknowledge that, as applicable, the electronic authorization contained in this section represents your written authorization for automated clearinghouse and debit card transactions as provided herein and will remain in full force and effect until you notify Super.com that you wish to revoke this authorization by indicating so to a Super.com customer service representative at
1 (877) 376-2710
. You must notify Super.com at least three (3) business days before the applicable Repayment Date in order to cancel this authorization for a given Supplementary Advance. When you call, please include the name and telephone number associated with your Super.com User Account. Failure to provide correct and complete information may make it impossible for Super.com to stop withdrawal of the preauthorized transaction.
‍
You agree to indemnify and hold Super.com harmless from and against any loss incurred as a result of its withdrawal of a preauthorized debit transaction from your Payment Method if any of the information relied upon in your request to stop payment is incorrect or incomplete. If you have followed the instructions in this section to notify Super.com of your desire to revoke your authorization at least three (3) business days before the Repayment Date, Super.com will be liable for your losses or damages directly caused by our failure to stop any preauthorized transaction. If we do not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled Repayment Date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so. You warrant and represent to Super.com that you have the right to authorize us to charge and credit your Payment Method for payments due to us in connection with a Supplementary Advance.
‍
If you have a Payment Method that is a joint account, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to (a) bind the absent account holder; and (b) enter into this Agreement independently. You agree to indemnify and hold Super.com harmless from any claims by any other owner of the Payment Method. You further acknowledge and agree that you are subject to the Consent to Electronic Communications disclosures in the Terms of Use as well as the Super.com Deposit Account and Secured Credit Card Consent to Electronic Communications.

ADDITIONAL TERMS - HOTEL BOOKINGS
SUPPLIER RULES AND RESTRICTIONS
Super.com works with several hotel suppliers. When a hotel room is reserved through the Travel Services with a hotel supplier, the terms and conditions of that particular hotel supplier will also apply to your reservation. Without limitation, when the hotel supplier is Travelscape LLC or Vacationspot, SL - you are bound to additional terms and conditions located at
http://developer.ean.com/terms/en/
.
If you violate any part of the hotel suppliers’ terms and conditions, we have the right to cancel your reservation and to make changes accordingly. You will be responsible for all fees that arise from making such changes should it be applicable. If you have used credits towards such a reservation, the credits will be forfeited and not returned to your account.
You acknowledge that some hotel suppliers may require you to agree to and sign their additional terms and conditions (including a liability waiver) prior to your stay at the hotel property or otherwise participating in the hotel services they offer. You understand that any violation of any such hotel supplier’s additional terms and conditions may result in cancellation of your reservation, you being denied access to the hotel property and/or other services, you forfeit any monies paid in connection with your reservation, and/or your Super.com User Account being debited for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.
‍
PRICES
The prices for the hotel services will be as quoted on the Travel Services from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect reservations already accepted. Despite our best efforts, some of the hotel services listed on the Travel Services may be incorrectly priced. We reserve the right to correct any pricing errors on the Travel Services and in such an event, we may (if available and at our discretion) cancel the reservation or offer you the opportunity to keep your pending reservation at the correct price.
We also reserve the right to cancel, to terminate or not to process reservations (including accepted reservations) where the price or other material information on the Travel Services is inaccurate. We are under no obligation to fulfill orders placed at an incorrect (lower) price, even after you have been sent confirmation of your order.
The price quoted on the Travel Services may include, where applicable, fees, tax recovery charges and taxes on Super.com’s services. Except with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, Super.com does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel reservations are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that Super.com pays to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room.
The hotel suppliers invoice Super.com for certain charges, including tax amounts, and are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by Super.com to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability and other related factors in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers.
In addition, your statement may include a transaction fee charged by your card issuer to process the transaction. We are not associated with these additional fees and will not be held liable for any fees relating to the transaction.
Fees for any additional services you elect or tips you pay post booking are non-refundable except as otherwise stated at the time such fees are charged or collected.
‍
PREPAID OR PAY AT HOTEL
You acknowledge that some reservations require prepayment, and some reservations can be paid later at the hotel property. If you select a prepaid reservation, you will be charged the full amount for the reservation immediately following the submission and acceptance of your reservation. Where you are using Program credits for your reservation (in whole or in part), your account will be debited the applicable credits immediately following the submission and acceptance of your reservation. Program credits may only be applied for prepaid reservations.
If you select a pay later rate, you will pay the hotel supplier upon arrival in their preferred currency for the full amount. You understand that tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between making your reservation and your stay at the hotel property, which means the amount you will pay the hotel supplier may differ from the amount reflected in your reservation.
Transaction fees may apply when making a reservation for a hotel property in a foreign country or in a foreign currency. These fees will be applied to the cardholder’s account by the card issuing bank, independent from Super.com. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rates applied to your order, please contact your credit card issuer.
‍
PROMOTIONS, DISCOUNTS, & CREDITS
Promotions, discounts, or credits will be applicable exclusively for bookings made on Super.com’s website and only when reserving accommodations where Super.com functions as the merchant of record.
‍
SPECIAL REQUESTS
We will do our best to pass on your special requests to the hotel supplier - but we cannot guarantee that the hotel supplier will be able to honor any special requests that you make. You must contact the hotel supplier directly to confirm the availability of any extra items or special requests. It is also your responsibility to verify that the hotel supplier can satisfy any special needs (such as accessibility features) that you may have.
‍
HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS
We act solely as an intermediary between you and the hotel for the purpose of facilitating hotel accommodation bookings. We do not own, operate, or control the hotels or their services. Therefore, we disclaim any responsibility for the state, quality, condition, or suitability of the hotel, hotel room, or hotel service provided to you. We may provide information about third-party services, such as hotels and their amenities, through our platform. However, we do not endorse or warrant the accuracy, reliability, or suitability of such information. You are advised to conduct your own research and due diligence before making any booking decisions.
In the event the hotel accommodation, hotel room, or hotel service fails to meet your expectations or satisfaction, we shall not be liable for any refunds, exchanges, compensation, or reimbursement. Any disputes or issues related to the hotel accommodations must be resolved directly between you and the hotel. We shall have no obligation to mediate or participate in such disputes.
‍
DATA-BACKED CLAIMS AND RELIANCE
We acknowledge that data-backed claims are based on available information and sources that are deemed reliable. However, we do not guarantee the absolute accuracy, completeness, or up-to-dateness of such claims. You understand and agree that any decisions or actions taken based on data-backed claims provided by us are at your own risk. We shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from the use of such claims, including but not limited to financial losses, business interruptions, or reputational harm. You are encouraged to independently verify any data-backed claims provided by us before making critical decisions. We shall not be responsible for any adverse outcomes resulting from the User's reliance solely on these claims without conducting appropriate due diligence.
‍
UNIFIED CREDITS
If you have a Super+ Membership and a Super.com Card, when you receive credits from
booking a hotel or flight on Super.com
, you will be able to use those credits across our two verticals, Financial Products & Earnings and Travel. This means that if you receive credits from Travel Services, these can be redeemed to your Super.com Deposit Account, where you can use it towards your everyday purchases on your Super.com Card anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Additionally, if you receive cash rewards from your Super.com Card these can be applied as credits to your hotel or flight bookings through the Travel Services. Please note there is a $100 daily, $250 weekly, and $1000 monthly redemption limit so you may not have access to your full cash rewards if you choose to redeem your credits or cash rewards into your Super.com Card. Additionally, unless stated otherwise, unredeemed credits remain available for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance.
‍
CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS
You can cancel your reservation on your email confirmation or by using our automated chat if you made the booking over text/chat via the Travel Services. However, cancellation fees may apply in accordance with the reservation terms and conditions. Each booking will have its own unique cancellation policy which can be found on the final booking step as well as in the confirmation email. If the policy is non-refundable, that means the booking is final sale and will not result in a refund if canceled.
You agree to pay any required cancellation fees when you confirm the booking. You also agree to pay any required change fees to modify your booking. Changes to your booking are not guaranteed and are subject to approval by hotel suppliers. Super.com is not liable for any rejected changes to a hotel booking and reserves the right to charge the modification fee regardless.
We are not responsible for the acts or omissions of any supplier or service provider. If a supplier or service provider is unable to honor your reservation, Super.com will not be liable for any costs incurred due to relocation. If you do not show for the initial part of your reservation but plan to check-in for subsequent dates in the reservation, you must confirm the reservation with Super.com no later than the original date of check-in to prevent cancellation of the whole booking. If you do not confirm the booking changes with Super.com the whole booking may be canceled and refunds will only be due to you in line with the cancellation policy of the particular property, as notified in the booking process.
‍
‍
LIMITED BOOKINGS GUARANTEE
‍
In the rare case that you are unable to check into a hotel with your Super.com reservation, we may provide you a full or partial refund ("
Limited Booking Guarantee
"). In addition to any specific terms set forth at the time the applicable reservation is offered, the following shall also apply:
For a Limited Booking Guarantee to apply you must contact Super.com immediately if you have difficulty checking in upon arrival. If you make your own arrangements without contacting Super.com you forfeit your rights to any Limited Booking Guarantee.

‍
CURRENCY CONVERTER AND FOREIGN TRAVEL
Currency rates are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as guidelines only. When paying in a different currency, the conversion rate is determined by your credit card issuing bank and Super.com can only provide you with an estimate. In addition, your statement may include a conversion or transaction fee (which may be in a foreign currency) charged by your card issuer to process the transaction. We are not associated with these additional fees and will not be held liable for any fees relating to varying exchange rates or card issuer fees.
Where your reservation is for a hotel property in a foreign jurisdiction, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that you have all necessary travel documents and that all foreign entry requirements are met. It is also your responsibility to make sure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip. We accept no liability if you are refused entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting through. By coordinating reservations for hotel services in international destinations, we do not make any representation or warranty that travel to such destinations are advisable or without risk. Super.com has no liability for any damages or losses that may result from your travel to any destination.
‍

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
‍
Using Your Card
The following rules apply to your use of your Card:
You must sign the Card when you receive it.
You must return the Card to us or destroy it if we ask you to.
You must take reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized use of your Card.
We are not responsible for any losses you incur if anyone refuses to accept your Card for any reason.
We may decline to authorize a transaction for any reason.
We are not responsible for any losses you incur if we do not authorize a transaction.
You must not use, or try to use, the Card for any illegal activity.
We are not liable for any losses that may result when our services are unavailable due to reasons beyond our control.
‍
Credit Limit and Available Credit
‍
Credit Limit
. We will assign a Credit Limit
to your Card Account. The Credit Limit will be based on your Deposit amount, but will not exceed $5,000. A Credit Limit is the maximum amount of credit we may extend to you when you use your Card Account. The total outstanding unpaid balance you owe on your Card Account (“Card Account Balance”) may never be greater than your Credit Limit. You are responsible for keeping track of your Card Account Balance. We may, at our discretion, refuse to extend credit for any reason including when pre-authorized charges or other holds might cause you to exceed your Credit Limit.
Available Credit
. Your Available Credit
is the amount of credit that is available for you to make transactions with your Card at any given time. Your Available Credit is equal to the Available Balance in your Deposit Account, minus the Spent Funds, up to your Credit Limit.
Rules
. You can use the Super App or contact customer service to view your Card Account Balance, Credit Limit, and Available Credit at any time. While we do our best to provide the most up-to-date information about your Card Account, there may be some delay in reflecting new transactions, for reasons outside our control such as network interruptions or delays by merchants in posting transactions and we cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information in the Super App or by phone. You are responsible for keeping track of your Card Account Balance, Credit Limit, and Available Credit. Our general practice is to decline transactions that may cause you to exceed your Credit Limit, Credit Limit or Available Credit. If we do honor these transactions, you are responsible for paying us back in full immediately, and these limits will not increase. We may increase or decrease your Credit Limit, Credit Limit, or Available Credit at any time, in our sole discretion. We are not required to extend credit up to your maximum Credit Limit, if it would cause you to exceed your Available Credit or your Credit Limit.
‍
‍
Using Your Card Account
Virtual Card.
We may permit you to obtain a virtual Card Account in the Super App or in a third-party wallet service and use the virtual Card Account to make transactions from time to time. Your use of a virtual Card Account is subject to additional terms and conditions which you must accept when you obtain or access a virtual Card Account. These additional terms and conditions are incorporated by reference herein. You may not be able to use a virtual Card Account at an ATM or any terminal that does not have the technology necessary to accept a virtual Card Account.
Point of Sale Purchases
. You may use your Card to make purchases at points-of-sale.
Cash Advances
. You may use your Card to obtain cash advances at ATMs. Obtaining a cash advance at an ATM is a loan and does not debit your Deposit Account. Interest, finance charges, and other fees may apply, as shown in the Truth in Lending Disclosure or any Fee Schedule we provide.
‍
Using a PIN
. We may give you a personal identification number (“PIN”) that you may use to make transactions on your Card. For security reasons, you may have to provide the PIN before you are able to use the Card. Keep your PIN secure. Do not write it down, give it to anyone, or keep it with your Card. If you lose your Card or believe the confidentiality of your PIN has been compromised for any reason, you must contact us immediately.
Rewards
. Your Card may provide you with the opportunity to earn rewards. If it does, we will separately provide you with information and terms about the rewards.
Responsibility for Card Use
. You are liable for all transactions made with your Card or Super Pay Account, and all related fees or expenses incurred, by you and any other person that you permit to use or have access to your Super Pay Account, Card, or any other Access Credential.
Lost or Stolen Card
. If your Card is lost or stolen or if you think someone else may be using your Super Pay Account, Card, or Access Credentials without your permission, you must contact us immediately at
support@super.com
.
‍
Interest and Fees:
Interest and Fees
. We will charge fees as disclosed in the
Truth in Lending Disclosures
on Pages 2 of this Agreement, subsequent disclosures, Statements, any change in terms notices, and in the
Fee Schedule
provided with this Agreement. If you miss a required payment, make a late payment, or a payment is returned and you fail to successfully make the required payment by the Due date [we may terminate Card Account.
Balance Computation Method
. To get the “average daily balance,” we take the beginning balance on the Card each day of the Cycle, add any new purchases, and/or fees, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us a daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the Cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance.”
Expedited Delivery Fee
. We impose a $25.00 fee for the expedited delivery of your Card.
Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies
. If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, the payment network will convert it into a U.S. dollar amount. The Mastercard will use its own currency conversion procedures. The conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date that appears on your Statement. We do not adjust the currency exchange rate or charge any currency conversion fees. Foreign transactions are subject to the Foreign Transaction Fee set forth in the Truth in Lending Disclosures.
ATM Fees
. We charge a fee if you use an out-of-network ATM. An out-of-network third-party operator of the ATM may charge a separate fee for your use of the ATM. This fee may be charged to your Card and access your line of credit. You are responsible for paying all such fees.
‍
‍
Payments
Your Promise to Pay
. You promise to pay us all amounts due on your Card Account by each Due date set forth on your Statement. This includes amounts where you did not sign a purchase slip or other documents for the transaction. We will treat transactions made without presenting a physical Card (such as for mail, telephone, Internet, or mobile device purchases) the same as if you used the Card in person. If you let someone else use your Super Pay Account, you are responsible for all transactions that person makes.
Minimum Payment
. Each billing cycle, you must pay us the payment amount listed on your Statement by the Due date. Failure to make the minimum payment subject to the default provisions herein.
Payment Methods
. Your payment must be made in U.S. dollars from a U.S. deposit account. You must use one of the following payment methods:
Preauthorized Automatic Payments (“AutoPay”)
. When you sign up, or by using the Super App, you may elect to make payments for your Card using AutoPay. Upon selecting AutoPay, you authorize us to make recurring debits from your respective Deposit Accounts or ACH transfers from Linked External Accounts, on each Due date, in the amount of the payment due (or another amount you select), as set forth on each Statement. You also authorize us to debit or credit your selected payment method as needed to correct any errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues, to the extent permitted by law.
One-Time Transfer
. You may use the Super App to authorize us to make a one-time transfer to us from your Deposit Account or ACH transfers from a Linked External Account on or before each Due date. You also authorize us to debit or credit your selected payment method to correct any errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues, to the extent permitted by law. We may permit additional payment methods from time to time. We may reject any payment not made in accordance with this section.
Effect of Payment on Credit Limit
. When we receive a payment and apply it to your Card Account from a payment method other than a transfer from your Deposit Account or digital wallet, your Credit Limit on your Card Account will increase in an amount equivalent to your payment. We may delay the change in your Credit Limit until we confirm that your payment has cleared. This may happen even if we credit your payment. If you have elected to make payments from the Deposit Account associated with your Card Account, your Deposit Account balance and your Spent Funds will be reduced by the amount of your payment, and your Credit Limit on the Card will not increase.
Payment Processing
. We may accept and process payments without losing any of our rights. If your payment is returned unpaid for any reason, you authorize us to re-initiate the payment you authorized up to two additional times. We also reserve the right to add the returned payment amount back to your Card Account.
How We Apply Your Payments
. Payments are first applied to any past-due amount, then to your current minimum payment due. We may adjust your Card Account Balance, Deposit Account balance, or Credit Limit as reasonably necessary to correct errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues.
Credit Balances
. We may reject and return any payment that creates or adds to a credit balance on your Card Account. Any credit balance we allow will not be available until we confirm that your payment has cleared. We may reduce the amount of any credit balance by any new charges. You may write to the address provided on your Monthly Billing Statement to request a refund of any available credit balance.
Non-Payment. In addition to any other rights we may have or actions we may take under this Agreement, if you fail to pay your outstanding balance on the Due date, we may exercise the Security Interest in the Collateral under the Security Agreement.
‍
Military Lending Act Disclosure
: The Military Lending Act provides protections for Covered Borrowers, as defined in at 32 C.F.R. § 232.3(g). The following provisions of this Military Lending Act Disclosure section apply to Covered Borrowers. If you would like more information about whether you are a Covered Borrower, you may contact us at 1 (866) 602-3983.
Military Lending Act Notice: Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependents may not exceed an Annual Percentage Rate of 36%. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: (i) the costs associated with credit insurance premiums; (ii) fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; (iii) any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and (iv) any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account).
Oral Disclosures: In order to hear these important disclosures related to the Military Lending Act, you may call 1 (866) 602-3983.
Applicability of Binding Arbitration: The Binding Arbitration section of this Agreement does not apply to Covered Borrowers.
‍
Credit Limit
. You may not spend more than the amount you have in your Deposit Account with your Card or with transactions on your Deposit Account. We refer to this limit as the Credit Limit. The Spent Funds
is a portion of the Available Balance in your Deposit Account in an amount equal to your total Card Account Balance. The Credit Limit on your Deposit Account may never exceed the Credit Limit or the Available Credit. If you make a transaction that causes you to exceed the Credit Limit on your Card Account, you agree to immediately make a payment on your Card or make a deposit to your Deposit Account such that you no longer exceed your Credit Limit. Our general practice is to decline any transaction that would cause you to exceed any applicable Credit Limit. Even if we have permitted you to exceed your Credit Limit before, we are not required to do it in the future. We may determine the amount of Available Balance, Spent Funds, and Card Account Balance for the purpose of deciding whether a transaction will cause you to exceed a Credit Limit only once, and at any time between the time you authorize the transaction and when we decline the transaction or send a notice of the declined transaction.
The Super App
. You can access your Card Account through the Super mobile application (Super App). You may log in to the Super App at any time to view and update information about your Card Account and initiate online transactions. Your use of the Super App is subject to the Super Pay Service Terms.
Other Transaction Limits
. For security reasons, there are limits on the number, amount, frequency, and type of transactions you can make using your Card or Super Pay Account. Similarly, there are limits on your ability to use your Card with certain merchants or terminals. To protect the security of your Super Pay Account, others’ accounts and systems, we may or may not disclose some or all of these limits and any changes to these limits, unless required by law. We may change these limits from time to time at our sole discretion. We will notify you of any limits or changes to these limits if required by applicable law. In our discretion, we may permit you to make transactions in excess of these limits, but our permission to do so on one occasion does not guarantee that we will allow a transaction in excess of the limits in the future. Your rights under this Agreement to make purchases, deposit funds, make ATM transactions, transfers, and other transactions with your Card or Super Pay Account are subject to this paragraph.
‍
Security; Locking Your Card Account
. CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR Card Account OR Card HAS BEEN LOST, STOLEN, OR ACCESSED OR USED BY ANY UNAUTHORIZED PERSON. You may ask us to lock any Card, and we may take other action we deem necessary to protect the security of your Super Pay Account or our systems. Locking a Card Account may not prevent all unauthorized transactions and will not prevent transactions that have already been initiated.
Governing Law.
This Agreement and your Card Account, and any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) at any time arising from or relating to your Card Account, this Agreement or any transferred balances, are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, by the laws of Missouri (without regard to internal principles of conflict of laws).
Communication with You.
We may contact you from time to time regarding your Card Account. We (and our affiliates, agents and contractors) may contact you in any manner we choose to the extent allowed by applicable law. For example, we may contact you:
(1) by mail, telephone, email, or text message;

You also agree that we may contact you using phone numbers, addresses and email addresses we obtain from public and nonpublic databases we may lawfully access; provided, that we will only do so in compliance with applicable law.

Some of the legal purposes for calls and messages include: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; transactions on or servicing of your Card Account; collecting on your Card Account; and providing you information about certain products, services and promotions.
Amendment or Modification.

‍
You must notify us of any potential errors
in writing
or electronically. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
‍
‍
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
Within 30 days of receiving your notice, we must tell you that we received your notice. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
Within 90 days of receiving your notice, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
The charge in question may remain on your monthly billing statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
If we made a mistake:
You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
If we do not believe there was a mistake:
You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
‍
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
‍
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
‍
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases
.
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these is necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
You must have used your Card Account for the purchase. Purchases made with cash withdrawals from an ATM do not qualify.
You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.
‍
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
‍
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
‍
Agreement to Arbitrate
‍
This section is referred to as the
Arbitration Agreement
. If you have a dispute with the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, and are not able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process set forth in this section.
‍
Arbitration
‍
You agree that if you have a dispute or claim that has arisen or may arise between you and the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach), your Super Pay Account and services provided under this Agreement, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, and you are not able to resolve the dispute or claim informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute or claim will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and the Bank are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
‍
‍
Parties Subject to this Arbitration Agreement
This Arbitration Agreement applies whenever there is a claim between you and us. If a third party, such as an Indemnified Party other than the Bank, is also involved in a claim between you and us, or if a dispute arises between you and an Indemnified Party other than the Bank relating to this Agreement or your Super Pay Account, then the claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party.
‍
‍
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A COVERED BORROWER UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE COVERED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT, IN WHICH CASE THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, PLEASE CONTACT US AT
support@super.com
.
‍
Exclusions
You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so failing will bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration.
‍
Your Right to Opt Out
If you do not want this Arbitration Agreement to apply to your Super Pay Account, you may opt out by sending us written notice of your decision within 30 days of the opening of your Super Pay Account. Such notice must clearly state that you wish to cancel or opt out of the Arbitration Agreement section of this Agreement. It should include your name, address, Super Pay Account number, and your signature and must be and must be emailed to
optout@livesuper.com
. This is the sole and only method by which you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Your exercise of the right to opt-out will not affect any remaining terms of this Agreement and will not result in any adverse consequence to you or your Super Pay Account. You agree that our business records will be final and conclusive evidence with respect to whether you canceled or opted out of this Arbitration Agreement in a timely and proper fashion.
‍
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE BANK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
‍
‍
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at
support@super.com
. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (
Notice
). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (
Notice Address
). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within 60 calendar days after the Notice is received, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank is entitled.
‍
‍
Arbitration Procedures
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (
AAA
) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the
AAA Rules
), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration
. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
‍
Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
‍
Costs of Arbitration
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
Arbitration Fees
) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, the Bank will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
‍
‍
Confidentiality
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
‍
Severability
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non
-
Individualized Relief
section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Super Pay Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).
‍
SECURITY AGREEMENT
‍
Our Security Interest in Your Deposit Account
. You hereby grant to us, as of the date you enter into this Agreement, a security interest in all right, title and interest in any Deposit Account you have with us, and all funds deposited therein, now owned or hereinafter acquired (collectively, the
Collateral
), to secure your performance under this Agreement, including your duty to pay us for all obligations you owe us under this Agreement, present or hereinafter occurring, when payments are due, for every transaction made with your Super Pay Account (
Security Interest
)
.
‍
‍
Our Right to Exercise the Security Interest
. You irrevocably and unconditionally relinquish possession and control over the Collateral, and you pledge and assign as security to us all of your right, title, and interest in it. You must take any action we request to perfect or protect our first lien position Security Interest in the Collateral. You waive the benefit of any homestead or other exemptions in the Collateral. The Security Interest will be governed by
Uniform Commercial Code - Article 9
(as adopted by the applicable state law) whether
Article 9
applies by its terms or not. We do not have to give you any prior notice to apply the funds in your Deposit Account or other Collateral or its proceeds to satisfy your obligations. You expressly agree that our rights under this Security Agreement extend to any electronically deposited federal or state benefit payments (including Social Security benefits) to the extent permitted by law. If you do not want your benefits applied in this way, you may change your direct deposit instructions at any time with the person or organization paying the benefits. In addition, you grant us a right of setoff to your Deposit Account to secure all amounts you owe us under this Agreement. This right of setoff does not apply to your Deposit Account if prohibited by law. You agree to hold us harmless from any claim arising as a result of our exercise of our right of setoff or Security Interest.
‍
‍
What Happens When You Spend Money
. When you make a transaction on a Card Account, an equivalent amount of funds in your Deposit Account will be classified as
Spent Funds
. The Spent Funds will remain in your Deposit Account. When you make a payment on your Card Account, an amount of the Spent Funds equal to the amount of the payment will no longer be classified as Spent Funds. You authorize us to limit your ability to withdraw or transfer all or part of the funds in your Deposit Account, up to the amount of funds classified as Spent Funds, as reasonably necessary to ensure that (1) your Card Account Balance and total of other transactions on your Deposit Account do not exceed the Available Balance in your Deposit Account at any given time; and (2) to preserve our rights under this Security Agreement.
‍
‍
YOU MAY LOSE FUNDS IN YOUR DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
. If you are in default of any obligation under this Agreement, or your Super App Account is closed for any reason, you authorize us to withdraw funds from your Deposit Account and apply such amounts to the outstanding Card Account Balance and any other amounts you owe us under this Agreement without sending you notice or demand for payment. We may do this in addition to the other rights we have under law or this Agreement. The application of your funds to the Card Account Balance and any other amounts you owe under this Agreement will not affect your obligation to pay us in full. You are responsible for the repayment of all amounts you owe us under this Agreement.
‍
‍
Legal Proceedings
. You represent that (a) there are no current lawsuits or bankruptcy proceedings that might affect our interest in your Deposit Account; and (b) you have not and will not attempt to transfer any interest in your Deposit Account to any other person or offer your Deposit Account as collateral or security for any other obligation. If any person seeks to attach your Deposit Account, for example by legal garnishment, you agree that we may deem all amounts you owe us, including any unpaid Card Account Balance, immediately payable and apply the funds in your Deposit Account as payment of those amounts. If we must hire an attorney to defend or enforce our rights under the Security Agreement, you will pay our reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs, unless prohibited by law.
‍
The application of Funds to your Card will not change your minimum payment amount. You are responsible for the repayment of any Obligation that is not satisﬁed by the application of Collateral. We may take up to 60 days to return any excess Collateral to you.
‍
If there is no activity with respect to your Account for a prescribed period of time (generally five (5) years), the Collateral may be presumed to have been abandoned and will escheat to and become the property of the State of Missouri or another applicable state. We will notify you if required by law prior to escheating any Collateral held under this Agreement.
‍
If you become a debtor in any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code, you agree that you will recognize us as a perfected secured creditor with respect to the Security Account and that you will declare the Funds held as a security deposit as exempt property pursuant to the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or applicable State exemption laws.
‍
We may amend the terms and conditions applicable to your Security Account separately from the remainder of this Agreement at any time with reasonable written notice to you if required by applicable law.
‍
No Warranties
. We are not responsible for any claim you may have regarding the purchase of goods or services made with your Card Account beyond your rights described in this section and on your Statement.
‍
Events of Default
. You will be in default if:
You fail to make any payment required under the terms of this Agreement when it is due;
Any required payment you make is rejected, not paid or cannot be processed;
You exceed your credit limit;
You file or become the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;
You are unable or unwilling to repay your obligations, including upon death or legally declared incapacity;
We determine that you made a false, incomplete or misleading statement to us, or you otherwise tried to defraud us;
You do not comply with any term of this Agreement or any other agreement with us;
You relocate outside the United States with a non-U.S. mailing address; or
We receive a garnishment, attachment or other levy upon your Deposit Account, or the Deposit Account is subject to any other legal proceeding.
If you are in default, we may take certain actions with respect to your Account. For example, depending on the default, we may take the following actions, without notifying you, unless the law says that we must give you notice:
(Close or suspend Card Account;
Reduce your credit limit;
Demand that you immediately pay the total balance owing on your Card Account;
Continue to charge you interest and fees (as set forth in the
Truth in Lending Disclosures
) as long as your Card Account Balance remains outstanding; and/or
File a lawsuit against you, or pursue another action that is not prohibited by law. If we file a lawsuit, you agree to pay our court costs, expenses and attorney fees, unless the law does not allow us to collect these amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your Account is 180 days past due, is part of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or is otherwise charged off, the total balance on your Account is immediately due and payable.

MRV Banks Account Agreement
GENERAL AGREEMENT
. You understand the following Digital Deposit Account Agreement ("Agreement") governs your account with us. Your account is also governed by other applicable documents, such as the Truth In Savings Account Disclosure and Privacy Policy, and where applicable, the Funds Availability Policy and Electronic Fund Transfer (Agreement and) Disclosure ("Disclosures"), which are incorporated by reference. By providing a written or electronic signature on the Account Information document or other agreement to open your account, or by using any of our deposit account services, you and any identified account owners agree to the terms contained in this Account Agreement.
DIGITAL DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TERMS.
This section governs your use of your Deposit Account.
Deposits
Limited Deposit Account Access
. Your Deposit Account is only accessible through the Super App on your mobile device. You may only make withdrawals and transactions from your Deposit Account by initiating permitted transactions on the Super App. You will not be able to make withdrawals or deposits on your Deposit Account at branch locations, by telephone, at the point of sale, or at ATMs.
You may not use your Card to debit your Deposit Account.
FDIC Insurance
. Funds in your Deposit Account are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (
FDIC
) through MRV Banks and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, up to the applicable limit. The amount of insurance coverage you have may depend on the balance in your Deposit Account and the ownership, type of, and balances held in any other accounts you have with us. For additional information, please visit the FDIC’s website at www.fdic.gov. You agree and acknowledge that your deposit may be aggregated with other deposits in one or more accounts of our choosing. However, in no event with the aggregate deposits exceed the FDIC insurance limits.
Deposit Requirements
. Deposits must be made in U.S. Dollars. Deposits made by ACH are subject to the
NACHA Operating Rules and Operating Guidelines
and the rules of any regional clearing houses we may use from time to time (collectively, the
ACH Rules
). Before final settlement of any deposit, we act only as your agent. We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items we accept for deposit (including items drawn “on us”). You authorize us to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in attempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond an applicable deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection in U.S. dollars. We will treat and record all transactions received after the Cutoff Time (defined below) on a Business Day we are open, or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next Business Day that we are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit.
Permitted Deposits
. Deposits to your Deposit Account may be made using one of the following payment methods:
External Debit Card
. You may use the Super App to authorize us to charge a debit card issued by an external U.S. bank and deposit the funds in your Deposit Account. You are responsible for any fees charged by the issuing bank for using your debit card.
Linked External Account
. You may authorize us to initiate ACH transfers from a Linked External Account to your Deposit Account. Use the Super App to set up, review, change or cancel your scheduled transfers.
Person-to-Person Transfer with Super.com Users
. You can receive transfers to your Deposit Account initiated by another Super.com user, using the person-to-person transfer services (
P2P Transfer
) provided in the Super App pursuant to Section IV.D below.
Cash Deposit at Retailer
. When and where available, you may load funds into your Deposit Account by tendering cash at a retailer participating in a network that supports Super Pay Accounts. When you present cash for deposit to a participating retailer you will use the Super App to present a barcode to a participating retailer. There are limits on the amount and frequency of deposits you may make using this method, and we reserve the right to make changes to such limits as needed. Security and fraud screenings may delay the availability of your deposit. If cash deposit is made available via the Super App and you make a cash deposit, you agree to the participating retailer’s Service Terms and Conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference. Cash deposits may only be made to your Super Pay Account by you. You understand and agree that cash transactions are not subject to certain consumer and fraud protections afforded to electronic transactions and fraudulent transactions or errors may result in a loss of your funds. You may find a participating retail location in the Super App. Subject to availability. Participating retail locations may change.
Direct Deposit
. You can direct a third party, such as an employer, to electronically deposit your paycheck, retirement benefits, or other income to your Deposit Account by ACH or wire transfer. Direct deposits may not be initiated in the Super App.
Mobile Check Deposit.
You may load funds into your Deposit Account by submitting an electronic image of a paper check (“Mobile Check”) using a “Mobile Check Deposit'' feature within the Super App, when available. You must provide all the requested permissions for the Super App to be able to capture images and to create and transmit the Mobile Check.
Other
. We may permit you to make deposits by other means we make available from time to time.
Rules for Mobile Check Deposit
. We may accept a check for deposit to your Deposit Account that is payable to you. We reserve the right to decline acceptance of a Mobile Check, at our discretion. We cannot guarantee that checks you ask us to deposit are valid, and we may return or reverse a deposit we later learn is fraudulent, counterfeit or otherwise invalid. Even if we accept your Mobile Check within the Super App, we reserve the right to decline acceptance at a later time, so it is important that you retain your original paper check in a secure location for at least forty-five (45) days. You must destroy the original paper check after forty-five (45) days and no later than sixty (60) days, unless we have contacted you about our ability to accept the Mobile Check and requested that you retain the check for a longer period of time.
You agree to restrictively endorse any check you deposit as “FOR MOBILE DEPOSIT ONLY, TO MRV Banks” and with your signature. You must endorse checks in the designated area or the area that extends 1 ½ inches from the trailing edge of the back of the check. After you receive confirmation from us that we have received the image of the check, you agree to mark the front of the item as “VOID” to ensure it is not re-presented for payment. We may endorse and collect checks deposited to your Deposit Account without your endorsement, but we may require your personal endorsement, and the personal endorsement of any other person to whom the check is payable, prior to accepting a check for deposit. We may, but are not required to, refuse to deposit any check that bears the endorsement of any other person, or any nonconforming endorsement, we are not required to comply with any other instructions or conditions written on the check, and you agree to hold us harmless from any loss, delay, claim or damage which may result. We may require verification of any endorsement.
When we accept a check for deposit to your Deposit Account, we are acting as your agent in collecting the check and we are not responsible if the check is lost or delayed in the collection process. If a check is lost during the collection process, or if we receive a returned check, a copy of a returned check, or other notice that a check you deposited is returned, we may charge your Deposit Account for the amount of the check, even if this causes a negative balance in your Deposit Account or any Wallet. We reserve the right to charge a Returned Item Fee for any check that is returned unpaid for any reason. By depositing a check (including any remotely created check), you warrant and guarantee that the check is authorized according to the terms on its face by the person identified as the drawer. You agree to indemnify us from all loss, expense, and liability related to a claim that such check was not authorized by the person(s) on whose account it was drawn. We may reject the deposit of any check that is not drawn on a U.S. financial institution or denominated in any currency other than U.S. dollars.
You agree that the image you submit of any check you attempt to deposit will be legible. You agree that we may use the amount shown on the check image or otherwise specified by you to determine the amount of the check, and we may provisionally credit your Deposit Account for that amount. This amount is subject to our subsequent verification and we may adjust your account for any errors.
You agree that you will not deposit or attempt to deposit any ineligible item, as described below in Section I.A.6. If you do, you agree to reimburse us for all claims, losses, costs and damages we incur because the check or other item does not meet applicable standards or causes duplicate payments.
We will use reasonable efforts to make the mobile check deposit service available for your use in the Super App, but we will not assume responsibility for any technical or other difficulties or any resulting damages that you may incur from this service.
Ineligible Items for Deposit
. You agree that you will not deposit or attempt to deposit the following types of checks or other items, each of which are ineligible for deposit to your Super Pay Account:
A third-party check that is made payable to another party and then endorsed to you

Representations and Warranties for Mobile Check Deposits
. By depositing or attempting to deposit any check using the Mobile Check Deposit feature, you represent, warrant, and covenant to us that:
Each image of a check transmitted to us is a true and accurate depiction of the front and back of the original check, without any alteration, and the drawer of the check has no defense against the payment of the check.
Each check that you submit to us for deposit will not be resubmitted in any format to us or any other person or payment, and will not cause the same drawer’s account to be debited twice.
The amount, payee, drawer, paying bank, MICR (magnetic ink character recognition), signatures, and endorsement on the original check are legible, genuine, and accurate.
Other than the digital image of an original check that you remotely deposit through the Mobile Check Deposit service in the Super App, there is no other duplicate image of the original check.
Each original check was authorized by the drawer in the amount stated on the original check, and to the payee stated on the original check.
You have not knowingly failed to communicate any material information to us
You will retain possession of each original check deposited using the Mobile Check Deposit service for at least two weeks, or such other time period we request, and neither you nor any other party will submit the original check for payment.
You will not use the Mobile Check Deposit service for any illegal activity.
Files and images transmitted to us will contain no viruses or any features that may have an adverse impact on our network, data, or related systems.
You will notify us of any suspected errors regarding items deposited through the Mobile Check Deposit Service immediately, and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Statement on which the deposit first appears is sent. Unless you notify the bank within sixty (60) days, the Statement will be deemed correct and you are prohibited from bringing a claim against the Bank for the alleged error unless required by law.
You accept the risk that a check or image may be intercepted or misdirected during transmission and we bear no liability.
You agree to cooperate with any investigation of the validity of any item you present for deposit and provide all documents we request.
A breach of any of these representations, warranties, or covenants is ground for the immediate termination of your access to the Mobile Check Deposit service, refusal to deposit any item that would cause such a breach, an immediate reversal of a transaction or credit to your Super Pay Account, and any other action we deem appropriate, subject to applicable law.
Early Access to Direct Deposits
. At our sole discretion, we may make funds available for certain direct deposits (for example, payroll payments) as soon as the payor notifies us that the payment has been initiated. This means we can make your money available to you up to 2 days before we receive the funds from the payor and would otherwise make them available to you. Even after we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you remain responsible if any deposit to your account is returned, rejected or otherwise uncollected. We cannot guarantee you early access to any direct deposit. Early access to a direct deposit does not guarantee early access to any subsequent direct deposit. Availability of this benefit may change between your pay periods. Eligibility of each direct deposit for early access is established by us in sole discretion and we reserve the right to refuse to provide early access to any direct deposit for any reason. For example, eligibility may be dependent on our fraud and risk criteria, the timing of your payor’s initiation of the payment, the time when we receive notice that your payor has initiated a payment, and other restrictions, such as transaction limits on your Super Pay Account. These limitations may be based on our confidential fraud and security controls that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of your Super Pay Account, and may be modified at our sole discretion without notice to you. Any direct deposit that is not made available early will otherwise be made available according to our Funds Availability Policy.
Deposit Records and Receipts
. We and our service providers may rely on the account number on any record of a deposit you make, even if that account number is associated with a name that is different from the name you have provided. It is not our responsibility to detect any inconsistency between the account number you provide and the name. You may use the Super App or call us to confirm that we have received a deposit. If you make a deposit, we may provide a confirmation of your deposit, but the amount on your deposit confirmation may not reflect the amount of funds we actually receive. We may confirm the funds you deposit and, after review, may adjust your Deposit Account for any errors including any errors on your deposit request or similar records. If we give you a confirmation for a deposit that you then cancel, the confirmation is void and you may not claim those funds.
Our Right to Refuse Deposits
. We may refuse a deposit, or part of a deposit, at any time. We also may refuse a deposit after initially accepting it. We will not be liable to you for refusing a deposit, even if it causes us to decline any transactions you have already made.
When You Can Withdraw Funds You Have Deposited
. Please see the Funds Availability Policy for information about when deposited funds will be available for withdrawal. If funds from a deposit become available, that does not mean the item deposited is “good,” has “cleared,” or has been paid by the paying bank. It is possible that the item will be returned unpaid months after we have made the funds available and you have withdrawn them.
Our Right to Charge Back Deposited or Cashed Items
. If you make a deposit and (a) the sending bank returns it to us unpaid; (b) the sending bank demands that we repay them because the deposit was unauthorized; or (c) the sending bank or the originator of a transfer demands that we return the item because it was unauthorized, sent to the wrong account number or procured by fraud, we may pay the return or demand, and subtract the funds from your balance in the Deposit Account. If we have reason to believe that any of the events in the previous sentence has occurred or may occur or that the item should not have been paid or may not be paid for any other reason, we may place a hold on the funds or move them to a bank-managed administrative account until we determine who is entitled to them.
All Deposits Are Credited Subject to Final Settlement in Cash or Credits
. We have the right to forward all deposited items to correspondents including all Federal Reserve Banks, and we will not be liable for default or neglect of any correspondents for loss in transit, and no correspondent will be liable except for its own negligence. You specifically authorize us or our correspondents including the Federal Reserve Banks to handle such items in accordance with provisions of Regulation J (12 CFR Part 210), as revised or amended from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board. In the event we are subject to local clearinghouse rules, you specifically authorize us to handle such items in accordance with the rules and regulations of the clearinghouse. If we permit you to withdraw funds from your Deposit Account before final settlement has been made for any deposited item, and final settlement is not made, we have the right to charge your Deposit Account or obtain a refund from you. In addition, we may charge back any deposited item at any time before final settlement for whatever reason. We will not be liable for any damages resulting from the exercise of these rights. Except as may be attributable to our lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care, we will not be liable for dishonor resulting from any reversal of credit, return of deposited items or for any damages resulting from any of those actions.
Withdrawals and Transfers
Available Balance
. You may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the Available Balance in your Deposit Account at any time, provided that the withdrawal will not cause you to exceed the Spending Limit(s) and any other limitations in this Agreement or limits you set on the Deposit Account by using the Super App. We determine your
Available Balance
by taking your previous day’s balance, plus any pending transactions that credit your Deposit Account (excluding pending returns), such as ACH direct deposits, and subtracting (a) pending charges such as, electronic payments, according to the Processing Order (defined in Section I.B.9 below) (b) amount of deposits that are not yet available for withdrawal under our Funds Availability Policy, and (c) any holds on your balance, such as holds on funds to comply with court orders or other legal requirements, or as authorized by the Security Agreement. We reserve the right to use a different method in certain states if required by law.
Withdrawal Rules
. When you initiate a withdrawal of funds from your Deposit Account, you authorize us to make the transaction selected. Withdrawals may be made in U.S. dollars by using the Super App to authorize a transfer of funds to a Linked External Account, to make payments on your Card, to make a P2P transfer to another Super.com user, or to make a transfer to another type of account or payee we may permit from time to time. Withdrawals to a Linked External Account and P2P transfers are processed as ACH transactions. Please see the
Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement
for more information. We may subtract from your Deposit Account balance the amount of any withdrawal, P2P Transfer, or other debit transaction that you or a person you authorized, initiated or approved. We may require you or any person you authorize to provide us with identification, documentation or information that is acceptable to us before allowing the transaction. You may not make or authorize any withdrawal in an amount that exceeds the applicable Spending Limit. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request by any method on forms not approved by us, or that we do not specifically permit for your Deposit Account, or that does not include all information we require, or that is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which is greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on your Deposit Account until your identity is verified. We reserve the right to establish (and change) maximum dollar limits for withdrawal transactions from time to time. Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later.
Cutoff Time
. Online requests to transfer funds to or from your Deposit Account must be received by us by 2:00 PM Eastern Time on a Business Day to be initiated on that Business Day. Online transfer requests received by us after 2:00 PM Eastern Time or on a day that is not a Business Day generally will be initiated on the next Business Day.
Right to Require Advance Notice of Withdrawals
. We reserve the right to require seven days’ notice in writing before each withdrawal.
Account Numbers on Fund Transfers
. If you instruct us to send a fund transfer, such as an ACH transfer, we, our service providers, and every other bank involved in the transfer may rely on any bank number or account number you provide. If the fund transfer instruction gives both a bank number or account number and a name, and the name identifies a different person from the bank or account owner identified by number, we and other banks that handle the fund transfer may still rely exclusively on the number. We have no duty to detect any inconsistency between the bank number or account number and the name.
Withdrawal Authority
. Any person who signs to open your Deposit Account or has authority to make withdrawals may, acting alone, withdraw or transfer all or any part of your Deposit Account balance at any time, subject to the limits set forth in this Agreement. Each of you (until we receive written notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person who signs or has authority to make withdrawals to endorse any item payable to you or your order for deposit to your Deposit Account or any other transaction with us.
Rules for ACH Transfers
. This Agreement is subject to Article 4A of the
Uniform Commercial Code – Fund Transfers
, as adopted in the state in which you have your Deposit Account with us. If you originate a fund transfer and you identify by name and number a beneficiary financial institution, an intermediary financial institution or a beneficiary, we and every receiving or beneficiary financial institution may rely on the identifying number to make payment. We may rely on the number even if it identifies a financial institution, person or account other than the one named. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association rules, such as the NACHA Rules. These rules provide, among other things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional until final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank or payment is otherwise made as provided in Article 4A-403(a) of the
Uniform Commercial Code
. If we do not receive such payment, we are entitled to a refund from you in the amount credited to your Deposit Account and the party originating such payment will not be considered to have paid the amount so credited. If we receive a payment order to credit your Deposit Account, we are not required to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.
Multiple Signatures
. We are not required to comply with any multiple-signature requirement, even if you have otherwise instructed us to do so.
Processing Order
. The following Processing Order
dictates the order in which we will process your transactions on your Deposit Account each Business Day. All credit transactions are processed first. Debits or withdrawals (such as ACH transactions) will be processed in the order in which they are received by us. The processing order of these items is important because if there is not enough money in your Deposit Account to pay for the items in the order they are processed in accordance with the processing order, we may decline the transaction, or it may cause an overdraft on your Deposit Account.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts
. Our general practice is to decline to pay any transaction that would cause an overdraft on your Deposit Account (
i.e.,
your Available Balance or ledger balance in your Deposit Account is less than the amount of that item plus all other items received but not yet paid) (
Overdraft
). Even if we have paid these items before, we are not required to do it in the future. We can change our practice of paying these items on your Deposit Account without notice to you. We may determine the amount of Available Balance for the purpose of deciding whether to return an item for insufficient funds at any time between the time we receive the item and when we return the item or send a notice in lieu of return. This may not occur until the merchant presents the transaction for payment, which may be several days after you authorize a transaction. We need only look at your Available Balance in your Super Pay Account once to decide if the item would cause an Overdraft or negative Available Balance, but if we choose to make a subsequent determination, the Available Balance at the subsequent time will determine whether there are insufficient available funds. It is your responsibility to avoid overdrawing your Deposit Account and maintain an Available Balance of at least $0.00 in your Super Pay Account.
Overdraft Fees
. You agree that we may charge fees for Overdrafts as set forth in the
Fee Schedule
.
Your Responsibility to Pay Overdrafts
. You are liable for any Deposit Account shortage resulting from charges or Overdrafts, whether caused by you or any other person to whom you provide access to your Super Pay Account. If we pay a transaction that causes an Overdraft or negative Available Balance, you must immediately pay the amount of any Overdraft and restore the Available Balance to at least $0.00. You have no right to defer such payments, and you are liable regardless of whether you signed the item or benefitted from the charge or Overdraft. If you fail to pay an Overdraft, we also may report you to consumer reporting agencies, close your Super Pay Account, or both. This could affect your ability to open accounts with us or other banks in the future. We may also apply funds in your Deposit Account to cure a negative Available Balance. You authorize us to use the money from any subsequent deposits to your Deposit Account to pay any Overdraft or apply the deposit to cure a negative Available Balance. Subsequent deposits include any federal or state benefit payments that you choose to deposit in your Deposit Account (including direct deposit of Social Security benefits), unless prohibited by law. You understand and agree that if you do not want your benefits applied in this way, you may change your direct deposit instructions at any time. We may still pursue collection of the amount you owe (including suing you) after it is charged off.
Waiver of Notices
. To the extent permitted by law, you waive any notice of non-payment, dishonor or protest regarding any items credited to or charged against your Deposit Account. For example, if you authorize a transaction and it is returned unpaid or we receive a notice of nonpayment, we do not have to notify you unless required by federal Regulation CC or other law.
Person to Person Transfers.
You may use your Super Pay Account to make person-to-person transfers (
P2P Transfers
) to other Super.com users.
Payment Authorization
. When you authorize a P2P Transfer, you authorize us to debit your Deposit Account for the amount you request to send, plus applicable fees if any, on or after the date of your authorization. We will send that amount (less fees, if any) to your designated recipient. By authorizing a P2P Transfer, you also authorize us to initiate any other transactions necessary to correct errors or reverse payments that are rejected or returned. You may not use an external bank account or any other payment method to fund a P2P Transfer. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have a sufficient Available Balance in your Deposit Account necessary to complete any payments initiated through the P2P Transfer service, and that the transaction will not cause you to exceed any Spending Limit. You agree to reimburse us for any fees, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of insufficient or unavailable funds in connection with any P2P Transfer you initiate.
Restrictions on P2P Transfers to Super.com Users Without Super Pay Account.
If you send a P2P Transfer to a recipient who does not have a Super Pay Account, you authorize us to hold the funds you send on behalf of your recipient, and we will issue promotional credit (
Credit
) to the recipient in lieu of cash. You understand that the recipient cannot redeem the Credit for cash unless and until the recipient opens a Super Pay Account. To send a P2P Transfer, you must provide the recipient’s valid mobile telephone number, which is capable of receiving SMS or “text messages.” If the recipient does not have a username or log-in for Super (
User Account
), the recipient will receive an SMS message notifying them of your P2P Transfer, with instructions for opening a User Account or Super Pay Account and claiming the Credit. Once the recipient has a User Account, the recipient will receive Credit in the amount of the P2P Transfer sent from your Super Pay Account. A User Account is not a Super Pay Account and your recipient may not use a User Account to redeem the Credit for cash. If the recipient opens a Super Pay Account, the Credit will be automatically redeemed for cash and deposited in their Super Pay Account. Credit has no cash value until and unless we redeem the Credit for cash, and credit it to a Deposit Account. Credit is issued solely for promotional purposes and is not FDIC-insured. Credit expires 5 years after the date it is issued, if it is not used or redeemed for cash. If the recipient fails to claim the Credit or their User Account is inactive for an extended period of time, it may be deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under applicable state law. See Super Pay Service Terms for more information.
Transaction Limits
. You may not make P2P Transfers that would cause you to exceed any transaction limits set forth in provision of this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Spending Limit applicable to your Deposit Account. We may reject or reverse any transaction that would cause you or the recipient of the P2P Transfer to exceed limits applicable to their Super Pay Account or User Account, or if we determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Transfer was invalid for any reason. The P2P Transfer service may not be used to conduct business, commercial or merchant transactions. We reserve the right to change these transaction limitations at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice to you, unless required by law.
Stop Payment
. All P2P Transfer requests may be processed as soon as we receive them, and we may be unable to stop the P2P Transfer. Our ability to stop a P2P Transfer once you have initiated it will depend on when you notify us of your desire to stop the transaction, and whether we have begun to process the P2P Transfer or have a reasonable opportunity to act on your request to stop the payment. You may contact
support@super.com
to initiate a Stop Payment request.
Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks
. P2P Transfers may be invalidated or reversed by us if, among other reasons, we send cash or Credit to you or your recipient in error, the funding transaction is declined or reversed, the P2P Transfer was unauthorized or unfunded, or the P2P Transfer was made for activities or reasons that violate this Agreement, the Super Pay Service Terms or any other agreement you have with us. If a P2P Transfer is invalidated for any reason, you may be liable to us for the full amount of the P2P Transfer, and we may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer (plus applicable fees, if any) from you. We may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer from the sender or recipient of the P2P Transfer in our sole discretion (subject to applicable law). When recovering the amount of an invalidated P2P Transfer from you, we may apply any funds sent to you in a subsequent P2P Transfer, from your Deposit Account or any incoming deposit to your Deposit Account, engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you, place a limitation or restriction on your Super Pay Account, or take any other action authorized by this Agreement, Super Pay Service Terms or any other agreement you have with us.
P2P Public Profile
. You may create a profile that is viewable and searchable by others in order to make P2P Transfers. The profile may include a picture, personal information, and transaction information. You are responsible for the content that you upload or add to the profile. The content that you upload or add to the profile will be used, shared, and stored in accordance with the Super.com Privacy Policy.
P2P Requests
. You may use the P2P Transfer service to request payments from your friends and family. When you do so, the Super App will automatically generate a draft text message on your smartphone’s texting feature, to send to the intended recipient. The text message will contain a unique link which the recipient can use to access a payments portal and make a payment to your Deposit Account, using an accepted payment method. The Super App does not automatically send the text message, and requires the person making the request to send the auto-generated message, using the recipient’s valid mobile phone number. The message may be edited, but the unique link may not be changed. If the person who receives the request successfully makes a payment using the unique link, the amount of the payment received will be deposited as cash into your Deposit Account, less applicable fees, if any. The recipient of the message is not required to respond to the request for payment, may choose to send a different amount of money than the amount requested, or choose not to respond or send you any money.
YOU MAY NEVER REQUEST A PAYMENT FROM ANYONE YOU DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY OR MAKE ANY UNSOLICITED REQUESTS FOR MONEY.
Your mobile or data carrier may charge a fee to send and receive these text messages. We are not responsible for these fees.
Other Restrictions
. The P2P Transfer service is subject to all other terms and restrictions set forth in the Super Pay Service Terms, which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the Service Terms and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control.
ADDITIONAL TERMS.
This section applies to all features of your Super Pay Account.
Communications, Statements, Notices of Errors, and Other Notices
Delivery of Notices
. You agree that we and our service providers may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, pre recorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Super Pay Account. Any legal disclosures, notices and communications and other Super Pay Account-related correspondence that we mail to you will be sent via U.S. Mail to the last mailing address shown in our records for your Super Pay Account. Notices will be deemed to have been delivered on the day we mailed it to you, or made it available electronically. We are not responsible for items lost in, or not delivered by, mail or e-mail. Some notices may only be available electronically or in paper form. Notice to any owner of your Super Pay Account is notice to all owners.
Notices You Send Us
. Any written notice you give us is effective after we actually receive and act on it, and it must be given to us according to the specific delivery instructions provided elsewhere, if any. We must receive it in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If the notice is regarding a check or other item, you must give us sufficient information to be able to identify the item, including the item number, amount, date and payee.
Electronic Communication
. Your Super Pay Account is an electronic account. We may send communications electronically, such as by email or text message, rather than through U.S. mail or other means, unless the law says otherwise. If you give us your email address, you agree that we may send servicing messages (such as fraud alerts and hold alerts) related to your Super Pay Account to that address. You may be required to agree to communicate with us by electronic means in order to open a Super Pay Account. If you revoke your consent to electronic communications, we may declare you to be in default of this Agreement, close your Super Pay Account or take other actions described in your
Super Pay Secured Charge Card Agreement
and the Consent to Electronic Communications.
Telephone Communication
. We may record and/or monitor any of our telephone conversations with you. If we do record, we do not have to keep the recordings, unless the law says we must. When you give us your mobile number, we have your permission to contact you at that number about all of your MRV accounts. Your consent allows us and our service providers to use text messaging, artificial or prerecorded voice messages and automatic dialing technology for informational and service calls, but not for telemarketing or sales calls. This communication may include contact from companies working on our behalf to service your Super Pay Account. Message and data rates may apply. You may change these preferences by calling 1 (877) 376-2710 on Monday – Friday between 8AM and 7PM EST or emailing
support@super.com
.
Change in Contact Information
. We require you to provide an email address, mobile telephone number, and physical street address if your mailing address is a P.O. box. You are responsible for promptly notifying us of any change to any such contact information or your name. In some instances, we may request additional information for verification purposes. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you have told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding when sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (
USPS
) or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.
Communications Equipment and Services
. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, mobile, broadband, computer, hardware, software, equipment and services needed to access and use your Super Pay Account online; view, save and/or print your Super Pay Account documents online; receive any messages or documents you have consented to receive electronically; and for paying all related charges. We are not required to act on any instruction or message from you provided by fax, SMS/text, or telephone voice mail, message service or answering machine. Whenever this Agreement or applicable law requires or allows you to give us written notice, we will not consider SMS/text or fax to be written notice.
Closing and Restricting Your Super Pay Account.
You May Close Your Super Pay Account
. You may request to close your Super Pay Account at any time for any reason. However, we are not required to close your Super Pay Account at your request if you have pending transactions, your Deposit Account is overdrawn, your Deposit Account balance is securing an outstanding Super Pay Card Balance, or your Deposit Account is subject to legal process (such as a garnishment, attachment, execution, levy or similar order) or fraud investigation. In those cases, we will restrict your Super Pay Account against all future withdrawals and other transactions, other than under legal process, until pending transactions are paid or returned, the balance on your Deposit Account is no longer negative, there is no outstanding Super Pay Card Balance on any of your Card(s), all investigations have been successfully completed to our satisfaction with no adverse findings, and any legal restriction on your Super Pay Account has been released.
We May Close Your Super Pay Account.
We may also close your Super Pay Account at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without prior notice to you. We will have no liability for any action we take under this section.
Rules for Closing Your Super Pay Account.
We may restrict your Super Pay Account in preparation for closing. As we do so, we will not pay any interest on your Deposit Account, and we may limit deposits to, or withdrawals from, your Deposit Account. We may prohibit further transactions on your Card. Items presented for payment may be dishonored. When you close your Super Pay Account, you are responsible for leaving enough money in your Deposit Account to cover any outstanding items to be paid from your Deposit Account. We may send you a written notice that we have closed your Super Pay Account. We will return the Available Balance in your Deposit Account less any outstanding unpaid Super Pay Card Balance, fees, claims, setoffs or other amounts you owe us, either electronically to a Linked External Account or by check sent to you by mail. This Agreement will survive the closing of your Super Pay Account and you are still responsible for obligations incurred prior to or in connection with the closing of your Super Pay Account. After your Super Pay Account is closed, we have no obligation to accept deposits or pay any outstanding transaction requests, but we may reopen your Deposit Account if we receive a deposit. This Agreement will survive the closing of your Super Pay Account and you are still responsible for obligations incurred prior to or in connection with the closing of your Super Pay Account.
Restricting Your Super Pay Account; Blocking and Delaying Transactions.
There are many reasons we may decline or prevent transactions to or from your Super Pay Account, but we generally do it to protect you or us, or to comply with legal requirements. We may decline or prevent any or all transactions to or from your Super Pay Account in our sole discretion, as permitted by applicable law. We may refuse, freeze, reverse or delay any specific withdrawal, payment or transfer of funds to or from your Deposit Account, or we may remove funds from your Deposit Account to hold them pending investigation, including in one or more of the following circumstances:
You maintain your Deposit Account at zero balance for at least 180 days;
You reside in or relocate outside of the U.S. or any U.S. territory where we offer the Super Pay Account;
You attempt to use your Super Pay Account for business purposes;
Your Super Pay Account is involved in any legal or administrative proceeding;
We receive conflicting information or instructions regarding Super Pay Account ownership, control or activity;
We suspect that you may be the victim of a fraud, scam or financial exploitation, even though you have authorized the transaction(s);
We suspect that any transaction may involve illegal activity, including violations of anti-money laundering laws and regulations, or may be fraudulent;
We are complying in our sole judgment with any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, including federal asset control and sanction rules and anti-money laundering rules, or with our policies adopted to assure that we comply with those laws, rules or regulations; or
We reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to avoid a loss or reduce risk to us.
Other Account Terms
Security
. It is your responsibility to protect the devices on which you access your Super Pay Account, your Card, the username, password, biometrics or other data you use to log into the Super App (
Access Credentials
). Do not share this information with anyone. If you give another person permission to use this information, you may be held fully liable for any transactions they make with your Super Pay Account, even if that person exceeded the authority you gave them. Please notify us immediately if you believe your Super Pay Account has been accessed without your permission. See the
Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement
and your
Super Pay  Secured Charge Card Agreement
of this Agreement for more information about your rights and responsibility in the event of unauthorized use of your Super Pay Account.
Assignment of Agreement and Successors
. You may not assign or transfer any interest in your Super Pay Account unless we agree in writing. Any permitted assignment of your Super Pay Account is subject to our setoff rights. This Agreement will be binding on your personal representative, executors, administrators and successors, and on our successors and assigns.
Power of Attorney
. A power of attorney is a document you sign that authorizes someone else, called the agent, to act on your behalf. If you sign a power of attorney, the agent can sign on your behalf and do anything you could do regarding your Super Pay Account, including withdrawing or spending all of the money in your Deposit Account. Do not sign a power of attorney unless you trust the agent to act in your best interest. If you choose to add an agent, you must provide a power of attorney form that we agree to accept. We may rely on a copy of an original power of attorney. We are not required to investigate the facts relating to any power of attorney provided to us on your behalf, including whether your signature on the power of attorney is authentic or whether the agent continues to have authority. We may follow or refuse to follow the agent’s instructions at any time, including if we suspect fraud or abuse on your Super Pay Account, unless applicable law requires otherwise. We may also refuse an agent’s request to become a joint owner or a beneficiary of a Super Pay Account, but we have no liability to anyone if we do so. We have no liability when we follow or refuse to follow any instructions from an agent, for example, if your agent misuses the authority you have given them.
Death or Incompetence.
We may continue to honor your transactions and instructions until: (a) we know of your death or adjudication of incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that we may pay or certify transactions made on or before the date of death or adjudication of incompetence for up to 10 days after your death or adjudication of incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the Super Pay Account.
No Waiver
. If we fail to exercise any right, that does not mean that we waive that right or any other right, and we may still enforce all of our rights in the future.
Headings and Rules of Construction
. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience or reference only and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions.

Changes to this Agreement
. We may change the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including fees and features of your Super Pay Account, at any time. We will notify you in advance of any such change when required by applicable law.

Legal Actions Affecting Your Super Pay Account.
If we are served with a subpoena, restraining order, writ of attachment or execution, levy, garnishment, search warrant, or similar order relating to your Super Pay Account (
Legal Action
), we will comply with that Legal Action. Or, in our discretion, we may freeze the assets in your Deposit Account and not allow any payments out of your Deposit Account, or use of the Card for obligations secured by your Deposit Account, until a final court determination regarding the legal action. We may do these things even if the legal action involves less than all of your funds in your Deposit Account. In these cases, we will not have any liability to you if there are insufficient funds to pay your items because we have withdrawn funds from your Deposit Account or in any way restricted access to your funds in accordance with the legal action. Any fees or expenses we incur in responding to any legal action (including attorneys' fees and our internal expenses) may be charged against your Super Pay Account. The
Fee Schedule
may specify additional fees that we may charge for certain legal actions.
Illegal Activities
. You agree not to use your Super Pay Account or permit anyone else to use your Super Pay Account for any illegal activity. We may refuse any gambling transaction, whether lawful or not.
Inactive and Unclaimed Accounts
. Each state has laws that govern when accounts are considered inactive or abandoned, and when we are required to send a customer’s funds to the state. We encourage you to make sure your Super Pay Account remains active by signing in to the Super App or making transactions. After a specified period of time determined by the law of the state of your residence (as shown in our records), if we are not able to locate you, we will be required to deliver your Deposit Account to the state as abandoned property. You will then need to apply to the state for return of your funds. If your Super Pay Account is or has been inactive, we may, in our discretion, refuse to honor requests for withdrawals or other transactions on your Super Pay Account until after we have verified that you have authorized the request.
Reporting to Consumer Reporting Agency
;
Disputes
. At our option, we may report information about you or your Super Pay Account and your performance under this Agreement to a consumer reporting agency. We may permit you to opt in or opt out of this reporting.

You may also submit a dispute directly to us by writing to us at
support@super.com

Rules Governing Your Super Pay Account.
Except as otherwise provided in the
Arbitration Agreement
, Super Pay , this Agreement, your Super Pay Account and all accounts and the services provided to you, any disputes relating to those accounts and services are governed by Federal Law and, when not superseded by Federal Law, the law of the state where your account is located. Here is how we determine where your account is located.
If you applied for an account in person at one of our banking offices, then the account is located in the state where you applied.
If you applied for the account digitally, or through other remote means, and your address as recorded in our records was in a state where we had a branch at the time, then the account is located in that state which for joint accounts, will be based on the address of the owner whose name was listed first.
In all other cases, your account will be governed by Missouri law.
Changes in these laws may change the terms and conditions of your Super Pay Account. We will notify you of any changes as required by law. Except as otherwise provided in the
Arbitration Agreement
, if any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. If this Agreement conflicts with any statements made by one of our employees or by a third-party service provider, this Agreement will govern.
Fees
. You agree to the terms of this Agreement and the
Fee Schedule
. You authorize us to deduct these charges, without notice to you, directly from the balance of your Deposit Account as accrued. You will pay any additional reasonable charges for services you request which are not covered by this Agreement.
Attorneys’ Fees Resulting from Collection or Dispute
. You will be liable for our costs as well as for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by law, whether incurred as a result of collection or in any other dispute involving your Super Pay Account. This includes you or a third party claiming an interest in your Super Pay Account. This also includes any action that you or a third party takes regarding the Super Pay Account that causes us, in good faith, to seek the advice of an attorney, whether or not we become involved in the dispute. All costs and attorneys’ fees can be deducted from your Deposit Account balance when they are incurred, without notice to you.
Limitation of Liability
. You agree that we, our service providers, agents, officers, directors, and employees (and the same of our service providers, subsidiaries and affiliates themselves) (collectively, the
Indemnified Parties
) will not be liable for anything we do when following your instructions. In addition, the Indemnified Parties will not be liable if any such Indemnified Party does not follow your instructions if we reasonably believe that your instructions would expose us to potential loss or civil or criminal liability, or conflict with customary banking practices. To the extent you are entitled to relief under this Agreement, the total liability of the Indemnified Parties to you will not exceed $500, except as otherwise required by applicable law. THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION AND EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF WE FAIL TO STOP PAYMENT ON AN ITEM, OR PAY AN ITEM BEARING AN UNAUTHORIZED SIGNATURE, FORGED SIGNATURE, OR FORGED ENDORSEMENT OR ALTERATION, OUR LIABILITY, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FACE AMOUNT OF THE ITEM. This section will survive termination of your Super Pay Account and termination of this Agreement.
Indemnification
. You agree to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against losses arising in connection with the services provided under this Agreement, except for losses arising out of our own gross negligence or willful misconduct. You further agree to hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from losses arising out of actions taken or omitted in good faith by any Indemnified Party in reliance upon instructions from you. The Indemnified Parties are not responsible for any actions or omissions by any third party. If you give us instructions that we believe may expose us to potential liability, we may refuse to follow your instructions and we will not be liable to you if we refuse to follow your instructions. If we do choose to follow your instructions, we may ask you for certain protections such as a surety bond or an indemnity agreement in a form that is satisfactory to us. This section will survive termination of your Super Pay Account and termination of this Agreement.
Filing a Lawsuit or Arbitration
. You must file any lawsuit or arbitration against the Indemnified Parties within two years after the cause of action arises, unless federal or state law or an applicable agreement provides for a shorter time. This limit is in addition to limits on notice as a condition to making a claim. If applicable state law does not permit contractual shortening of the time during which a lawsuit must be filed to a period as short as two years, you and we agree to the shortest permitted time under that state’s laws. We abide by applicable federal and state record retention laws and may dispose of any records that we retained or preserved for the period set forth in these laws. Any action against us or another Indemnified Party must be brought within the period that the law requires us to preserve records, unless applicable law or this Agreement provides a shorter limitation period or applicable law requires a longer limitation period. This section is subject to Section II.C.28, which may require you to submit your claims to arbitration. This section will survive termination of your Super Pay Account and termination of this Agreement.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
Location of Legal Proceedings
. If you file any lawsuit or other legal proceeding against an Indemnified Party that is connected in any way to your Super Pay Account or services, you agree to do so in an appropriate court in the State of Missouri. If we file any lawsuit or legal proceeding that is connected in any way to your Super Pay Account or this Agreement, you consent to jurisdiction and venue in an appropriate court in the State of Missouri. If any party chooses to have disputes resolved by arbitration, the
Arbitration Agreement
governs the process and location of the arbitration proceedings.
Pre
-
Judgment Interest Rate
. If either you or we are awarded a judgment against the other in connection with your Super Pay Account, the rate of interest earned before judgment on the judgment amount will be the rate of interest your Deposit Account earned during that period unless state law requires a different rate.
Unlawful Internet Gambling Notice
. Restricted transactions as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG are prohibited from being processed through this Super Pay Account or relationship. Restricted transactions generally include those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful Internet gambling.
Severability
. Any provision of this Agreement that limits the Bank’s liability does not negate the Bank’s duty (if any) under applicable law to act in good faith and with ordinary care. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to limit the Bank’s liability in a way prohibited by applicable law, or to be otherwise unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such provision with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified.
Joint, Trust, Fiduciary and Custodial Accounts
. You acknowledge that if your account is set up as a joint, trust, fiduciary or custodial account, it is your sole responsibility to determine the legal effects of opening and maintaining an account of this nature.
Joint Account With/Without Right of Survivorship
. If this account is noted as a joint account with right of survivorship, on the death of one party to a joint account, all sums in the account on the death vest in and belong to the surviving party(ies) as his or her separate property and estate. In the event this account is designated as a joint account without right of survivorship and we receive written notice of death of any person named on the account, we may freeze the account until we have received satisfactory evidence as to the disposition of the account. If the account is between spouses, the account shall be considered held as a tenancy by the entirety unless otherwise noted.
Wisconsin residents:  If one owner of a marital account dies, the survivor is entitled to 50% of the account funds and the estate of the deceased is entitled to the other 50%.  If a marital account contains a payable on death designation, the beneficiary is entitled to the deceased spouse’s 50% share.  We will have no responsibility to determine respective interests of the owner and the payable on death beneficiary.
Florida residents:  A Florida joint account owned solely by two spouses is a “tenants by the entirety” account unless the signature card or application materials designate otherwise.  We are not required to determine whether an account is a tenants by the entirety account before responding to a garnishment or other legal process.  We may assert our right of setoff or security interest in a tenants by the entirety account in order to collect debts of either owner.
Pay on Death or In Trust For Account
. The type of account ownership may determine how your funds are paid if you die, even if your Will states otherwise. Please consult your estate planning advisor or attorney about your choices. If this account is designated as a Pay on Death account, such account shall, during the lifetime of the person(s) first named on the account as the depositor(s), be the property of and under the sole control of such person(s). Depositor(s) shall be entitled to cancel, change, give away, or otherwise deal with the account as if no other person was named on the account. At the death of all depositors, the account shall become the property of the person(s) named as the "Pay on Death" person(s). This account is governed by the choice of law provisions set forth herein in Section II.C.12 unless otherwise required by law. We are authorized to require proof of death and surrender of the evidence of the account prior to withdrawal after the death of all of the depositors. If there is more than one depositor who is a holder of the account, the depositors shall be joint tenants with right of survivorship. Any payment that we make on the account shall be entitled to full credit upon such payment without the necessity of determining whether any other person shall have an interest in the account, unless we have been served with process by a court of competent jurisdiction restricting payment on the account in accordance with the terms of such process. If the account is noted as an In Trust For account, you agree to perform all of your duties as trustee for the account as required by law. You may change the named beneficiary at any time. When the trustee makes a deposit and no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust other than this description shall have been given in writing to us, in the event of the death of the trustee, the deposit or any part of the deposit, together with the interest, may be paid to the beneficiary for whom the deposit was thus stated to be made to the extent permitted by law.
Representative Payee Accounts
. If you open an account as a representative payee for someone who receives social security payments, or as a legal custodian, spouse payee, or other custodian for someone who receives Veterans Administration payments, you agree not to permit any deposits to the account other than the designated payments. We are not required to determine whether you deposit other funds or whether any withdrawals or transfers from the account are for the support of the person for whose benefit the funds are paid.
Foreign Exchange Transactions
. The exchange rate applied to transactions that occur in a different currency will be selected by the network that processes the transaction. The network will select from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets or a rate mandated by the government that issues or controls the currency in that country on the date in which the transaction is processed. The date on which the transaction processes from which the exchange rate is applied may differ from the date you used your account. When the transaction is posted to your account, we will charge a foreign exchange rate adjustment fee on the transaction amount after conversion to U.S. dollars. The exchange rate we may use may include a spread, commission or other costs that we, our affiliates or vendors charge in providing for an exchange to you. The exchange rate may vary among customers depending on the type of transaction being conducted, the dollar amount, the currency involved, and the date and the time of the exchange. You should expect these rates will be less favorable than rates quoted on line or in publications.
Escheatment/Abandonment
. If your account is closed, we will return any balance, less any fees, claims, set-offs or other amounts which may be applied against your balance. Funds that cannot be returned or transferred may be considered abandoned under the jurisdiction in which you reside. Each state has its own laws that govern escheatment and when we are required to send a customer’s funds to that state.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
Agreement to Arbitrate
‍
This section is referred to as the
Arbitration Agreement
. If you have a dispute with the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, and are not able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process set forth in this section.
‍
Arbitration
‍
You agree that if you have a dispute or claim that has arisen or may arise between you and the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach), your Super Pay Account and services provided under this Agreement, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, and you are not able to resolve the dispute or claim informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute or claim will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and the Bank are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
‍
Parties Subject to this Arbitration Agreement
This Arbitration Agreement applies whenever there is a claim between you and us. If a third party, such as an Indemnified Party other than the Bank, is also involved in a claim between you and us, or if a dispute arises between you and an Indemnified Party other than the Bank relating to this Agreement or your Super Pay Account, then the claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party.
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A COVERED BORROWER UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE COVERED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT, IN WHICH CASE THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, PLEASE CONTACT US AT
support@super.com
.
‍
Exclusions
You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so failing will bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration.
‍
Your Right to Opt Out
If you do not want this Arbitration Agreement to apply to your Super Pay Account, you may opt out by sending us written notice of your decision within 30 days of the opening of your Super Pay Account. Such notice must clearly state that you wish to cancel or opt out of the Arbitration Agreement section of this Agreement. It should include your name, address, Super Pay Account number, and your signature and must be and must be emailed to
optout@super.com
. This is the sole and only method by which you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Your exercise of the right to opt-out will not affect any remaining terms of this Agreement and will not result in any adverse consequence to you or your Super Pay Account. You agree that our business records will be final and conclusive evidence with respect to whether you canceled or opted out of this Arbitration Agreement in a timely and proper fashion.
‍
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
‍
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE BANK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at
support@super.com
. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (Notice). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (Notice Address). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within 60 calendar days after the Notice is received, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank is entitled.
‍
Arbitration Procedures
‍
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (
AAA
) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the
AAA Rules
), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,
http://www.adr.org
. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration
. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
Costs of Arbitration
‍
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
Arbitration Fees
) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, the Bank will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
‍
Confidentiality
‍
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
Severability
‍
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non
-
Individualized Relief
section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Super Pay Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).

Fee Schedule
lists the fees that may be applicable to your Super Pay Account. You agree to pay all fees applicable to your Super Pay Account. We reserve the right to add or change fees at a later time, and we will notify you of any changes to our fees and this

FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
PURPOSE
. The information here describes our policy of holding deposited items in a Deposit Account before funds are made available to you for withdrawal.
‍
DETERMINING THE AVAILABILITY OF YOUR DEPOSIT
. Our policy is to delay the availability of funds from your deposits. The length of the delay varies based on the type of deposit as set forth below. During the delay, you may not withdraw the funds, and we will not pay transactions from your Deposit Account using these funds.
The length of the delay is counted in Business Days from the day we receive your deposit.
If you make a deposit before
1:00 PM ET
on a Business Day, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after
1:00PM ET
or on a day that is not a Business Day, we will consider the deposit made on the next Business Day.
‍
Same Day Availability
. Electronic direct deposits (e.g., ACH, person-to-person transfers, and other EFTs your Deposit Account supports) will be available on the day we receive your deposit.
‍
Next Day Availability
. Funds from the following deposits are available on the first Business Day after the day we receive your deposit:
U.S. Treasury checks that are payable to you.
The first $225.00 of check deposits.
Cash deposits that are not made in person to an employee of MRV Banks.
Second Business Day
. Unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, all other funds from deposits will be made on the second Business Day after the day we receive your deposit.
Longer Delays May Apply
. Funds you deposited by check may be delayed for longer than two Business Days under the following circumstances:
We believe a check you deposited will not be paid;
You deposited checks totaling more than $5,000 in any one day;
You redeposited a check that has been returned unpaid;
You have overdrawn your Deposit Account repeatedly in the last six months; or
There is an emergency, such as failure of communications or our systems.
If we delay availability for one of these reasons, funds may not be available until the seventh Business Day after the day of your deposit. We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available.
‍
Special Rules for New Accounts
. If you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your Deposit Account is open.
Funds from electronic direct deposits to your Deposit Account will be available on the first Business Day after we receive the deposit.
Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers, and the first $5,000 of a day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's, and federal, state and local government checks] will be available on the first Business Day after the day of your deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions.
The excess over $5,000 will be available no later than the ninth Business Day after the day of your deposit.
Funds from all other check deposits will be available on the third Business Day after the day of your deposit.
Foreign Checks
. Checks drawn on financial institutions outside of the U.S. (foreign checks) cannot be processed the same as checks drawn on U.S. financial institutions. Foreign checks are exempt from the policies outlined in this disclosure. Generally, if your Deposit Account permits you to deposit foreign checks, the availability of funds from deposits of foreign checks will be delayed for the time it takes us to collect the funds from the financial institutions upon which they are drawn.
‍
Your Responsibility for Deposits
. Even if we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you are still responsible for deposits that are returned to us unpaid and for any other problems involving your deposit.

Managing Your Super Pay Account Balance

If you contact us to stop a payment, please have the following information ready: your Super Pay Account number, the date the transfer is to be made, to whom the transfer is being made, and the amount of the scheduled transfer. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call. Stop-payment orders may expire after six months from the date of your stop-payment request, and you may be required to renew it in order to ensure its continued effectiveness.
‍
Liability for Failure to Stop Payment of Preauthorized Transfer
If you order us to stop a preauthorized automatic debit three Business Days or more before the transfer is scheduled and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.
‍
Notice of Varying Amounts
If you have authorized regular payments out of your Deposit Account, and these regular payments may vary in amount, we or the person you are going to pay will tell you, 10 days before each payment, when it will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.
‍
Our Refusal to Pay a Preauthorized or Other Regular (Automatic) Debit
We reserve the right to refuse to pay a regular (automatic) debit, for example, if your Deposit Account has insufficient funds to cover such transfer or if we are unable to verify the ownership of or other information about the account to which the funds will be transferred. You may call us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or email us at
support@super.com
to request information about a refusal by us to pay a regular (automatic) debit.
‍
Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers
During your online Super Pay Account set-up, you will be invited to register your phone number and create Access Credentials to protect your Super Pay Account from unauthorized access. You are responsible for maintaining ownership of the mobile device associated with the phone number and security of your other Access Credentials.
‍
Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that any Access Credentials or device you use to access your Super Pay Account has been lost or stolen, that an EFT has been made without your permission, or that someone has transferred or may transfer money from your Deposit Account without your authorization
. You may tell us by calling us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or by writing to us as soon as possible at
support@super.com
(or such other address as we may provide to you from time to time).
Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down.
You could lose all the money in your Deposit Account. If you tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Access Credentials or device, your liability will be limited to $50 if someone accesses your Deposit Account without your authorization.
‍
If you DO NOT tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Access Credentials or device, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Access Credentials or device without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
‍
Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us AT ONCE. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
‍
If you grant authority to make transfers to another person who exceeds the authority granted, you are fully liable for any transfers until you notify us that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.
‍
In Case of Errors or Questions about your EFTs
Call us at 1 (877) 376-2710 or write us at
support@super.com
as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we send the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.
‍
(1) Tell us your name and your Super Pay Account number (if any).
(2) Describe the error or transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.
(3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.
We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your Deposit Account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes
us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your Deposit Account.
‍
For errors involving new Super Pay Accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new Super Pay Accounts, we may take up to 20 days to credit your Deposit Account for the amount you think is in error.
‍
We will tell you the results within three Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
‍
Our Liability for Failure to Make a Transfer
If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Deposit Account on time or in the correct amount according to this Agreement, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:
If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Deposit Account to make the transfer.
If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line of credit, if you have one.
If an automated teller machine where you are making a transfer does not have enough cash. If a system or terminal you use to make a transfer was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.
If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.
There may be other exceptions stated in this Agreement.
‍
Person to Person Money transmission
‍
The liability protections provided in this paragraph do not apply to transactions involving person to person money transmission services or similar payment transmission services.  Please be advised federal laws providing certain consumer protections with respect to fraudulent deposit account activities may not apply to transactions made using person to person money transmission services.  As such, customers are advised to use caution when transmitting money using person to person money transmission services.  You should only send money using such services to known and reliable recipients.
‍
Charges for Transfers or the Right to Make Transfers
We may assess a fee for each EFT, or stop-payment order. Please see the applicable
Fee Schedule
to determine the applicable amount. The circumstances under which such charges will be assessed, as well as the amount of the charge, are included in the current
Fee Schedule
.
‍
Confidentiality
We will disclose information to third parties about your Super Pay Account or the transfers you make:
‍
(1) Where it is necessary for completing transfers;
(2) In order to verify the existence and condition of your Super Pay Account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant;
(3) In order to comply with government agency or court orders;
(4) To persons authorized by law in the course of their official duties;
(5) To our employees, auditors, service providers, attorneys, or collection agents in the course of their duties;
(6) As disclosed in our Privacy Notice; and,
(7) If you give us your written permission.
‍
Amendments
We may change any provision of this
Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement
at our sole discretion. If we do, we will give you notice if and to the extent required by applicable law.
‍
Termination
‍
We reserve the right to terminate your use of any or all of our EFT services for any reason and at any time without notifying you. You also have the right to terminate your use of the EFT services described in this Agreement at any time by calling us or writing to us. If you call, we may require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 10 Business Days after you call. (Please note that e-mail, SMS/text or online notification will not meet the notice requirements of this section.) If you terminate your use of our EFT services and you have arranged for automatic (regular) transfers involving third parties, you are required to inform any third parties that the transfers will cease. Any termination of your use of our EFT services, whether initiated by you or us, will not affect any of your or our rights and obligations under this Agreement that have arisen before the effective date of such termination.

‍
Super.com Card and Deposit Account Need to Know
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SUPER.COM SECURED CHARGE CARD AND THE SUPER.COM DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
‍
THIS IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN KEY TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SUPER.COM CHARGE CARD (“CARD”) AND THE SUPER.COM DEPOSIT ACCOUNT (“DEPOSIT ACCOUNT”) OFFERED BY REPUBLIC BANK & TRUST COMPANY (“REPUBLIC BANK”). YOU CAN GET THE COMPLETE TERMS AT SUPER.COM/LEGAL AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT SUPER.COM/SUPPORT.
‍
How it Works:
‍
The Super.com Card is a secured charge card available to you if you are a Super+ Member and you have a Super.com Deposit Account. Because the Card is a charge card, you are required to pay off your Card Balance each month.
Your Card credit limit is $5,000 and your card is secured by your Deposit Account. The amount available for your use (“Available Credit”) depends on how much money you have available in your Deposit Account. You must first add funds to your Deposit Account to make a purchase with your Card
When you use your Card for purchases or an ATM Cash Advance, the amount of that transaction will reduce your Available Balance and Available Credit. Although funds in your Deposit Account are used to repay your outstanding Card balance, Card transactions are credit transactions and do not debit your Deposit Account.
The Deposit Account can be funded with direct deposits, ACH transfers from an external bank account, transfers from an external debit card, Person-to-Person Transfers from other Super.com users, or Super+ Membership earnings. Funds in your Deposit Account are held at Republic Bank and are FDIC insured.
You can withdraw available funds from your Deposit Account by ACH transfer to an external bank account or Person-to-Person Transfer to other Super.com users. You may use the Bank Account and Routing information for your Deposit Account to have external merchants debit the account for bill payments. ACH withdrawals are subject to the limits and fees in the “What it Costs” section below.
You can use your virtual or physical (if you request one) Card to make purchases everywhere Mastercard is accepted, earn cash back rewards, and take cash advances via an ATM. When making purchases with the Card, Super+ Members receive 10% cashback on all hotel bookings made through Super.com and 1% cashback on everything else.
When you access your Card or Deposit Account on the Super.com App or website, you can find your balance information and your Bank Account and Routing numbers, access FAQs, view your credit score, access your monthly statement, and update your account information.
You have the option to have Republic Bank report your Card activity, including payments, to the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax). This may help build your credit; however, once you opt in to credit reporting, you cannot opt-out.
Information about your Card and Deposit Accounts will be provided to you electronically. It is important for you to keep your contact information, including your email address, current.
‍
What it Costs:
Super.com Card
The Super.com Card has no monthly or annual account maintenance fees, no interest charges, no statement fees, and no late fees. You are, however, required to be a Super+ Member to be eligible for the Card, which costs $15.00/month.
If you obtain an ATM Cash Advance using an ATM outside of the MoneyPass network, you will incur a $2.50 fee from Republic Bank, as well as any fees that the ATM operator may impose. There are no ATM Cash Advance fees if you use a MoneyPass ATM.
Expedited delivery of a replacement Card costs $25.
Any currency exchange fees are determined by Mastercard.
Super.com Deposit Account
The Super.com Deposit Account has no statement fees, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, or stop payment fees.
You can initiate one (1) free ACH withdrawal from your Deposit Account per calendar month. Any ACH withdrawal thereafter in the same month will incur a fee of 1.5%, with a maximum fee of $5 assessed per withdrawal. ACH withdrawals are limited to only funds that have been deposited to your Deposit Account from direct deposit, ACH transfer, or external debit card.
A $5.00 Check Fee will be assessed if you request a check when you close your Deposit Account.
‍
Payments:
The Card is a charge card, meaning the balance must be paid in full each month. A Statement will be made available to you online monthly with information about your balance and the Payment Due. This information is also available on the Super.com website or the Super.com App.
You must make Card payments from your Deposit Account. You can set up automatic recurring payments (AutoPay) or make one-time manual payments.
With Autopay, you authorize Republic Bank to debit the Payment Due on the Auto Payment Date shown in your Statement from your Deposit Account. The Auto Payment Date will be 10 days before your Payment Due Date. If you have elected for us to report your Card information to the credit bureaus, by debiting your Payment Due before your Payment Due Date, we will report a lower credit utilization to the credit bureau.
If you do not enable Autopay, you will need to manually log into your Deposit Account to pay your Payment Due on or before the Payment Due Date shown in your Statement. If you do not make your Payment Due by the Payment Due Date, Republic Bank will exercise its security interest and use the funds we have secured in your Deposit Account to satisfy your Payment Due.

Super.com Deposit Account Agreement
Last Edited January 28, 2025
‍
INTRODUCTION.
Thank you for opening a Super.com Deposit Account (defined below) with Republic Bank & Trust Company, Member FDIC, serviced by Snapmoney, Inc., a Delaware corporation doing business as Super.com (“Super.com”). Please read this entire agreement carefully so you understand your rights and obligations for your Deposit Account and deposit relationship with us. In this Super.com Deposit Account Agreement, “Republic,” “Republic Bank,” and “Bank,” refer to Republic Bank & Trust Company, and “we,” “us” and “our” all refer to Republic and its representatives, affiliates and agents. “You” and “your” refer to each and every owner of the Deposit Account(s) you have with us and each and every other person with authority to withdraw funds from the Deposit Account(s) or otherwise operate the Deposit Account(s), both jointly and severally, including any password, account number, or other credentials you use to access the Deposit Account (“Access Device”). For clarity, Super.com is not a Bank but may provide administrative services for the Deposit Account, acting as an agent for Republic Bank.
‍
THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
AS DESCRIBED BELOW IN SECTION XII.
BINDING CONTRACT.
This Super.com Deposit Account Agreement, including the Fee Schedule and other Deposit Account opening documents for your Deposit Account, are part of the binding contract between you and us (collectively, the “Deposit Agreement”) for your Deposit Account. They contain the terms of our agreement with you. Please read all of these documents carefully. The Deposit Agreement also summarizes certain laws and regulations that apply to common transactions, provides some disclosures for deposit accounts required by applicable law, and establishes terms that cover some transactions or situations that the law either does not cover or allows us to change by this contract. In order to obtain and maintain a Deposit Account, you must also agree to and comply with the Terms of Use and Service Terms required by Super.com and its affiliates. When you complete our Deposit Account opening process, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and understand the terms of the Deposit Agreement and you agree to be governed by these terms. You understand that the Deposit Agreement, as it may be updated or supplemented from time to time, governs your Deposit Account and your deposit relationship with us. We give our Deposit Agreement to you when we open your Deposit Account, along with the other terms of the Agreement. You may obtain additional copies of the Deposit Agreement at the Super.com website (the “Site”) at Super.com/legal or in the Super.com mobile application (the “Super.com App”). Our deposit relationship with you is that of creditor. The Deposit Agreement and the deposit relationship do not create a fiduciary, quasi-fiduciary, or special relationship between us regardless of how you title your Deposit Account, or whether you act in a fiduciary or similar capacity with respect to funds deposited with us. We owe you only a duty of ordinary care. Our internal policies and procedures are solely for our own purposes and do not impose on us a higher standard of care than otherwise would apply by law without such policies or procedures.
DEFINITIONS.

The Available Balance in your Super.com Deposit Account, at any given time, is generally equal to the amount deposited into your Super.com Deposit Account and made available to you under our Funds Availability Policy, less your Card Balance.

governing your Super.com Card for more information.
Hold
: Any amount of money in or associated with your Deposit Account that is unavailable to you. A Hold may be placed for more than your Available Balance. Examples of reasons a Hold may be placed on funds include, without limitation, when we place a Hold on an amount of any Item which you have deposited into your Super.com Deposit Account (see
SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
), or a Hold on an amount specified in a court order received by us. Funds that are on Hold will not be used to pay Items presented to the Bank.

Examples include a draft and an electronic transaction (including ACH transfers). Such an Item may be presented to the Bank multiple times (for example, by a merchant). Each presentment or attempted presentment is considered a separate Item. An Item also includes a purported order, instruction, or authorization to withdraw or pay funds or money from a Deposit Account, unless otherwise prohibited by law or regulation.

GENERAL DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AGREEMENT.
The Deposit Account Agreement establishes the terms and conditions governing your Super.com Deposit Account and the fees associated therewith.
‍
‍
Limited Digital Deposit Account Access.
Your Deposit Account is only accessible through the Super.com App or the Site. You cannot use your Super.com Card to debit funds from your Deposit Account. Please see your
Super.com Secured Charge Card Agreement
governing your Super.com Card for more information. You will not be able to make deposits to your Super.com Deposit Account at branch locations, by telephone, at the point of sale, or at ATMs.
Processing Order
. The Processing Order
set forth in this section dictates the order in which we will process your transactions on your Super.com Deposit Account each Business Day. When we receive deposits and Items, and make them available to you, depends on the nature of the deposit or Item and a number of other factors, as further described in
SECTION VII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
. Generally, all transactions are processed in the order in which they are received by us. When Items are presented at the same time (for example, ACH transactions), credits will be applied first, then debit transactions in the order of lowest to highest dollar amount. The processing order of these items is important because if there is not enough money available in your Deposit Account to secure the Items in the order they are processed we may decline the transaction.
Deposit Rules:
You may only make deposits to your Super.com Deposit Account by initiating permitted transactions on the Super.com App or the Site or as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement. Permitted deposit transactions on your Deposit Account include direct deposits, ACH transfers from a Linked External Account, transfers from a Linked Debit Card, Super+ Membership earnings, and person-to-person transfers described below.
Please see SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY for information about when deposited funds will be available for withdrawal.
Permitted Deposits
. Deposits to your Super.com Deposit Account may be made using one of the following methods:
Linked Debit Card
. You may use the Super.com App or the Site to link and authorize us to charge a debit card issued by an external U.S. bank and deposit the funds in your Deposit Account. You are responsible for any fees charged by the issuing bank for using your debit card.
Linked External Account
. You may authorize us to initiate ACH transfers from Linked External Account to your Super.com Deposit Account. Use the Super.com App or the Site to set up, review, change or cancel your scheduled transfers.
Person-to-Person Transfer with Super.com Users
. You can receive transfers to your Super.com Deposit Account initiated by another Super.com user with an Deposit Account, using the person-to-person transfer services (“P2P Transfer”) provided in the Super.com App or the Site pursuant to the terms of this Deposit Agreement and the Super.com Terms of Use.
Direct Deposit
. You can direct a third party, such as an employer, to electronically deposit your paycheck, retirement benefits, or other income to your Super.com Deposit Account by ACH. Direct deposits may not be initiated in the Super.com App or the Site.
Super+ Membership earnings
.
You can redeem earnings from games, tasks, and surveys accrued through your Super+ Membership to your Super.com Deposit Account, subject to the Super.com Financial Products & Earnings Service Terms.
Other
. We permit you to make deposits by other means we make available from time to time.
FDIC Insurance
. Funds in your Super.com Deposit Account are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) through Republic Bank and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, up to the applicable limit. The amount of insurance coverage you have may depend on the balance in your Deposit Account and the ownership, type of, and balances held in any other accounts you have with us. For additional information, please visit the FDIC’s website at www.fdic.gov. You agree and acknowledge that your deposit may be aggregated with other deposits in one or more accounts of our choosing.
‍
Deposit Requirements
. Deposits must be made in U.S. Dollars. Deposits made by ACH are subject to the
Nacha Operating Rules and Operating Guideline
and the rules of any regional clearing houses we may use from time to time (collectively, the “ACH Rules”). Before final settlement of any deposit, we act only as your agent. We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items we accept for deposit (including items drawn “on us”). You authorize us to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in attempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond an applicable deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect or that we select in our sole discretion on final collection in U.S. dollars. We will treat and record all transactions received after the Cutoff Time (defined below) on a Business Day we are open or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next Business Day that we are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit.
‍
Early Access to Direct Deposits
. At our sole discretion, we may make funds available for certain direct deposits (for example, payroll payments) as soon as the payor notifies us that the payment has been initiated. This means we can make your money available to you up to two (2) days before we receive the funds from the payor and would otherwise make them available to you. Even after we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you remain responsible if any deposit to your Deposit Account is returned, rejected or otherwise uncollected. We cannot guarantee you early access to any direct deposit. Early access to a direct deposit does not guarantee early access to any subsequent direct deposit. Availability of this benefit may change between your pay periods. Eligibility of each direct deposit for early access is established by us in sole discretion and we reserve the right to refuse to provide early access to any direct deposit for any reason. For example, eligibility may be dependent on our fraud and risk criteria, the timing of your payor’s initiation of the payment, the time when we receive notice that your payor has initiated a payment, and other restrictions, such as transaction limits on your Super.com Deposit Account. These limitations may be based on our confidential fraud and security controls that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of your Super.com Deposit Account, and may be modified at our sole discretion without notice to you. Any direct deposit that is not made available early will otherwise be made available according to
SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
.
‍
Deposit Records and Receipts
. We and our service providers may rely on the Deposit Account Number on any record of a deposit you make, even if that Deposit Account Number is associated with a name that is different from the name you have provided. It is not our responsibility to detect any inconsistency between the Deposit Account Number you provide and the name. You may use the Super.com App or the Site or call us to confirm that we have received a deposit. If you make a deposit, we may provide a confirmation of your deposit, but the amount on your deposit confirmation may not reflect the amount of funds we actually receive. We may confirm the funds you deposit and, after review, may adjust your Deposit Account for any errors including any errors on your deposit request or similar records. If we give you a confirmation for a deposit that you then cancel, the confirmation is void and you may not claim those funds.
‍
Our Right to Refuse Deposits
. We may refuse a deposit, or part of a deposit, at any time. We also may refuse a deposit after initially accepting it. We will not be liable to you for refusing a deposit, even if it causes us to decline any transactions you have already made.
‍
When You Can Withdraw Funds You Have Deposited
. Please see
SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
for information about when deposited funds will be available for withdrawal. If funds from a deposit become available, that does not mean the item deposited is “good,” has “cleared,” or has been paid by the paying bank. It is possible that the item will be returned unpaid months after we have made the funds available and you have withdrawn them.
‍
Our Right to Charge Back Deposited or Cashed Items
. If you make a deposit and (a) the sending bank returns it to us unpaid; (b) the sending bank demands that we repay them because the deposit was unauthorized; or (c) the sending bank or the originator of a transfer demands that we return the Item because it was unauthorized, sent to the wrong account number or procured by fraud, we may pay the return on demand, and subtract the funds from your balance in the Super.com Deposit Account. If we have reason to believe that any of the events in the previous sentence has occurred or may occur or that the Item should not have been paid or may not be paid for any other reason, we may place a hold on the funds or move them to a Bank-managed administrative account until we determine who is entitled to them.
‍
All Deposits Are Credited Subject to Final Settlement in Cash or Credits
. We have the right to forward all deposited Items to correspondents including all Federal Reserve Banks, and we will not be liable for default or neglect of any correspondents for loss in transit, and no correspondent will be liable except for its own negligence. You specifically authorize us or our correspondents including the Federal Reserve Banks to handle such items in accordance with provisions of Regulation J (12 CFR Part 210), as revised or amended from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board. In the event we are subject to local clearinghouse rules, you specifically authorize us to handle such items in accordance with the rules and regulations of the clearinghouse. If we permit you to withdraw funds from your Deposit Account before final settlement has been made for any deposited item, and final settlement is not made, we have the right to charge your Deposit Account or obtain a refund from you. In addition, we may charge back any deposited Item at any time before final settlement for whatever reason. We will not be liable for any damages resulting from the exercise of these rights. Except as may be attributable to our lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care, we will not be liable for dishonor resulting from any reversal of credit, return of deposited Items or for any damages resulting from any of those actions.
‍
Withdrawal Rules.
When you initiate a withdrawal of funds from your Super.com Deposit Account, you authorize us to make the transaction selected. Withdrawals may be made in U.S. dollars by using the Super.com App or the Site to authorize a transfer of funds to a Linked External Account, to make payments on your Super.com Card, to make a P2P transfer to another Super.com user, or to make a transfer to another type of account or payee we may permit from time to time. Only funds deposited to your Super.com Deposit Account from direct deposit, a Linked External Account, or Linked Debit Card can be transferred from your Super.com Deposit Account to a Linked External Account. Please see Section IX.
ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS
for more information. We may subtract from your Deposit Account Balance the amount of any withdrawal, P2P Transfer, or other debit transaction that you or a person you authorized, initiated or approved. We may require you or any person you authorize to provide us with identification, documentation or information that is acceptable to us before allowing the transaction. You may not make or authorize any withdrawal in an amount that exceeds your Available Balance or any other limit we may impose on your Deposit Account from time to time. There are other limits on the amount, type, and frequency of transactions you may make on your Deposit Account. See
Section
X
. LIMITS
for details. We will disclose these limits and changes to these limits when required by applicable law. We may not disclose these limits, for example, if it is necessary to maintain the security of your Deposit Account or our systems. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request by any method on forms not approved by us, or that we do not specifically permit for your Super.com Deposit Account, or that does not include all information we require, or that is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which is greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on your Super.com Deposit Account until your identity is verified. We reserve the right to establish (and change) maximum dollar limits for withdrawal transactions from time to time. Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later.
‍
Permitted Withdrawals:
Withdrawals from your Super.com Deposit Account may be made using one of the following methods:
Linked External Account
. You may authorize us to initiate ACH transfers from your Super.com Deposit Account to a Linked External Account. Only funds deposited to your Super.com Deposit Account from direct deposit, a Linked External Account, or a Linked Debit Card are available for transfer to a Linked External Account. Use the Super.com App or the Site to set up, review, change or cancel your scheduled transfers.
Payments to Super.com Card:
You must make required payments to your Super.com Card using funds in your Super.com Deposit Account. Please refer to your
Super.com Charge Card Agreement
for details.
Person-to-Person Transfer with Super.com Users
. You can send ACH transfers to another Super.com user with an Deposit Account, using the person-to-person transfer services (“P2P Transfer”) provided in the Super.com App or the Site pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
Other
. We permit you to make withdrawals by other means we make available from time to time.
Available Balance
. You may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the Available Balance in your Deposit Account at any time, provided that the withdrawal will not cause you to exceed the limits specified in
SECTION X
. LIMITS
or limitations you set on the Super.com Deposit Account by using the Super.com App or the Site. Your Available Balance reflects the funds in your Deposit Account that are immediately available for use. The Available Balance includes any pending transactions that credit your Deposit Account (excluding pending returns), such as ACH direct deposits, but does not include (a) pending charges on your Super.com Deposit Account such as, electronic payments, according to the Processing Order, (b) amount of deposits that are not yet available for withdrawal under
SECTION VIII. FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY
, (c) the outstanding unpaid balance on your Super.com Card, and (d) any Holds on your balance, such as Holds on funds to comply with court orders or other legal requirements. We reserve the right to use a different method in certain states if required by law.
‍
The difference between one-time and recurring transactions.
One-time transactions represent any single transaction, while recurring transactions represent pre-authorized scheduled payments you have authorized by providing your Deposit Account information (such as account and bank routing number) to a merchant for goods or services. We rely on the merchant to code transactions appropriately as recurring or non-recurring.
Cutoff Time
. Online requests to transfer funds to or from your Deposit Account must be received by us by 2:30 PM Eastern Time on a Business Day to be initiated on that Business Day. Online transfer requests received by us after 2:30 PM Eastern Time or on a day that is not a Business Day generally will be initiated on the next Business Day.
‍
Deposit Account Numbers on Fund Transfers
. If you instruct us to send a fund transfer, such as an ACH transfer, we, our service providers, and every other bank involved in the transfer may rely on any bank routing number or Deposit Account number you provide. If the fund transfer instruction gives both a bank routing number or number and a name, and the name identifies a different person from the bank or account owner identified by number, we and other banks that handle the fund transfer may still rely exclusively on the number. We have no duty to detect any inconsistency between the bank routing number or Deposit Account number and the name.
‍
Rules for ACH Transfers
. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association rules, such as the Nacha Rules. These rules provide, among other things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional until final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank or payment is otherwise made. If we receive a payment order to credit your Super.com Deposit Account, we are not required to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.
PERSON TO PERSON TRANSFERS.
‍
You may use your Super.com Deposit Account to make person-to-person transfers to other Super.com users.
‍
Payment Authorization
. When you authorize a P2P Transfer, you authorize us to debit your Deposit Account for the amount you request to send on or after the date of your authorization. We will send that amount to your designated recipient. By authorizing a P2P Transfer, you also authorize us to initiate any other transactions necessary to correct errors or reverse payments that are rejected or returned. You may not use an external bank account or any other payment method to fund a P2P Transfer. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have sufficient funds in your Deposit Account necessary to complete any payments initiated through the P2P Transfer service, and that the transaction will not cause you to exceed your balance or any other limits imposed on your Super.com Deposit Account. You agree to reimburse us for any fees, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of insufficient or unavailable funds in connection with any P2P Transfer you initiate.
‍
Restrictions on P2P Transfers to Super.com Users Without a Super.com Deposit Account.
We do not permit a P2P Transfer to a recipient who does not have a Super.com Deposit Account. To send a P2P Transfer, you must provide the recipient’s valid mobile telephone number, which is capable of receiving SMS or “text messages”.
‍
Transaction Limits
. You may not make any transaction that would cause you to exceed any transaction limits set forth in
SECTION X
. LIMITS
. We may reject or reverse any transaction that would cause you or the recipient of the P2P Transfer to exceed your Available Balance, or other limits applicable to their Super.com Deposit Account or User Account, or if we determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Transfer was invalid for any reason. The P2P Transfer service may not be used to conduct business, commercial or merchant transactions. We reserve the right to change these transaction limitations at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice to you, unless required by law.
Stop Payment
. P2P Transfer requests are likely to be processed as soon as we receive them, and therefore, we may be unable to stop P2P Transaction requests. It is your responsibility to confirm the details of your P2P Transfer request prior to providing authorization to us for the P2P Transfer. If you would like to make a P2P Stop Payment request, understanding that we may not be able to satisfy this request, please contact finproductssupport@super.com.
‍
Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks
. P2P Transfers may be invalidated or reversed by us if, among other reasons, we send cash or credit to you or your recipient in error, the funding transaction is declined or reversed, the P2P Transfer was unauthorized or unfunded, or the P2P Transfer was made for activities or reasons that violate this Agreement, the Super.com Terms of Use or any other agreement you have with us. If a P2P Transfer is invalidated for any reason, you may be liable to us for the full amount of the P2P Transfer, and we may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer (plus applicable fees, if any) from you. We may recover the amount of the P2P Transfer from the sender or recipient of the P2P Transfer in our sole discretion (subject to applicable law). When recovering the amount of an invalidated P2P Transfer from you, we may apply any funds sent to you in a subsequent P2P Transfer, from your Super.com Deposit Account or any incoming deposit to your Deposit Account, engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you, place a limitation or restriction on your Super.com Deposit Account, or take any other action authorized by the Agreement, or any other agreement you have with us.
‍
P2P Public Profile
. You may create a profile that is viewable and searchable by others to make P2P Transfers. The profile may include a picture, personal information, and transaction information. You are responsible for the content that you upload or add to the profile. The content that you upload or add to the profile will be used, shared, and stored in accordance with the Super.com Privacy Policy.
‍
P2P Requests
. You may use the P2P Transfer service to request payments from your friends and family. When you do so, the Super.com App or the Site will automatically generate a draft text message on your smartphone’s texting feature, to send to the intended recipient. The text message will contain a unique link which the recipient can use to access a payments portal and make a payment to your Super.com Deposit Account, using an accepted payment method. The Super.com App or the Site does not automatically send the text message and requires the person making the request to send the auto-generated message, using the recipient’s valid mobile phone number. The message may be edited, but the unique link may not be changed. If the person who receives the request successfully makes a payment using the unique link, the amount of the payment received will be deposited as cash into your Deposit Account. The recipient of the message is not required to respond to the request for payment, may choose to send a different amount of money than the amount requested, or choose not to respond or send you any money.
YOU MAY NEVER REQUEST A PAYMENT FROM ANYONE YOU DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY OR MAKE ANY UNSOLICITED REQUESTS FOR MONEY.
Your and your recipient’s mobile or data carrier may charge a fee to send and receive these text messages. We are not responsible for these fees.

Electronic Communication

We may send communications electronically, such as by email or text message, rather than through U.S. mail or other means, unless the law says otherwise. If you give us your email address, you agree that we may send servicing messages (such as fraud alerts and Hold alerts) related to your Super.com Deposit Account to that address. If you revoke your consent to electronic communications, we will declare you to be in default of this Agreement, and close your Super.com Deposit Account.

You May Close Your Super.com Deposit Account
. You may request to close your Super.com Deposit Account at any time for any reason. However, we are not required to close your Super.com Deposit Account at your request if you have pending transactions, your Deposit Account is overdrawn, your Deposit Account Balance is securing an outstanding Super.com Card Balance, or your Deposit Account is subject to legal process (such as a garnishment, attachment, execution, levy or similar order) or fraud investigation. In that case, we will restrict your Super.com Deposit Account against all future withdrawals and other transactions, other than under legal process, until pending transactions are paid or returned, the balance on your Super.com Deposit Account is no longer negative, there is no outstanding Super.com Card Balance, all investigations have been successfully completed to our satisfaction with no adverse findings, and any legal restriction on your Super.com Deposit Account has been released.

When you close your Super.com Deposit Account, you are responsible for leaving enough money in your Deposit Account to cover any outstanding Items to be paid from your Deposit Account. We may send you a written notice that we have closed your Super.com Deposit Account. Once pending Items are settled, Holds released, and any outstanding Super.com Card Balance secured by the Deposit Account is satisfied, we will return the Deposit Account Balance to you less any outstanding unpaid fees, claims, setoffs or other amounts you owe us, either electronically to a Linked External Account or by check sent to you by mail (a $5.00 check fee applies, see

We abide by applicable federal and state record retention laws and may dispose of any records that we retained or preserved for the period set forth in these laws.

‍
Severability
. Any provision of this Agreement that limits the Bank’s liability does not negate the Bank’s duty (if any) under applicable law to act in good faith and with ordinary care.

‍
Power of Attorney
. A power of attorney is a document you sign authorizing someone else, called your agent, to act on your behalf. If you sign a power of attorney, the agent can sign on your behalf and do anything you could do regarding your Super.com Deposit Account, including withdrawing or spending all of the money in your Deposit Account. Do not sign a power of attorney unless you trust the agent to act in your best interest. If you choose to add an agent, you must provide a power of attorney form that we agree to accept. We may rely on a copy of an original power of attorney. We are not required to investigate the facts relating to any power of attorney provided to us on your behalf, including whether your signature on the power of attorney is authentic or whether the agent continues to have authority. We may follow or refuse to follow the agent’s instructions at any time, including if we suspect fraud or abuse on your Super.com Deposit Account, unless applicable law requires otherwise. We may also refuse an agent’s request to become a joint owner or a beneficiary of a Super.com Deposit Account, but we have no liability to anyone if we do so. We have no liability when we follow or refuse to follow any instructions from an agent, for example, if your agent misuses the authority you have given them.

If you open an Deposit Account as a representative payee for someone who receives social security payments, or as a legal custodian, spouse payee, or other custodian for someone who receives Veterans Administration payments, you agree not to permit any deposits to the account other than the designated payments. We are not required to determine whether you deposit other funds or whether any withdrawals or transfers from the account are for the support of the person for whose benefit the funds are paid.
‍
International and Foreign Exchange Transactions
. We generally do not permit international transactions or transactions in foreign currency on your Super.com Deposit Account. All transactions will be processed in U.S. dollars. If we permit you to make an international transaction or transaction in foreign currency, any applicable exchange rate applied to transactions that occur in a different currency will be selected by us, our service provider, or by the network that processes the transaction. We, our service provider, or the network will select from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets or a rate mandated by the government that issues or controls the currency in that country on the date in which the transaction is processed. The date on which the transaction processes from which the exchange rate is applied may differ from the date you used your Deposit Account. The exchange rate we may use may include a spread, commission or other costs that we, our affiliates or vendors charge in providing for an exchange to you. The exchange rate may vary among customers depending on the type of transaction being conducted, the dollar amount, the currency involved, and the date and the time of the exchange. You should expect these rates will be less favorable than rates quoted online or in publications.
‍
Escheatment/Abandonment
. If your Deposit Account is closed, we will return any balance, less any fees, claims, set-offs, or other amounts which may be applied against your balance. Funds that cannot be returned or transferred may be considered abandoned under the jurisdiction in which you reside. Each state has its own laws that govern escheatment and when we are required to send a customer’s funds to that state.

‍
Our Refusal to Pay a Preauthorized or Other Regular (Automatic) Debit.

Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us AT ONCE. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was delivered to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.

Right of Setoff/Security Interest
‍
We may take or setoff funds in any or all of your accounts with us for direct, indirect and acquired obligations that you owe us, regardless of the source of funds in an Account. This provision does not apply to IRA or tax-qualified retirement accounts, to consumer credit card obligations (except to the extent the credit card issuer lawfully exercises a security interest in your account or its proceeds securing repayment of the credit card obligations ), or where otherwise prohibited by law. Your accounts include both accounts you own individually and accounts you own jointly with others. Our setoff rights are in addition to other rights we have under this Agreement to take or charge funds in your Deposit Account for obligations you owe us. If the law imposes conditions or limits on our ability to take or setoff funds in your accounts, to the extent that you may do so by contract, you waive those conditions and limits and you authorize us to apply funds in any or all of your accounts with us to obligations you owe us. Some government payments may be protected from attachment, levy or other legal process under federal or state law. If such protections apply, to the extent that you may do so by contract, you waive these protections and agree that we may take or setoff funds, including federal and state benefit payments, from your accounts to pay fees, and other obligations you owe us.We may use funds held in your joint accounts to repay obligations on which any account owner is liable, whether jointly with another or individually. We may use funds held in your individual accounts to repay your obligations to us, whether owed by you individually or jointly with another, including: obligations owed by you arising out of another joint account of which you are a joint owner, even if the obligations are not directly incurred by you; obligations on which you are secondarily liable; and any amounts for which we become liable to any governmental agency or department or any company as a result of recurring payments credited to any of your accounts after the death, legal incapacity or other termination of entitlement of the intended recipient of such funds. If you are a sole proprietor, we may charge any of your personal or business accounts.If we take or setoff funds from a time deposit account, we may charge an early withdrawal penalty on the funds withdrawn. We may take or setoff funds from your account before we pay Checks or other Items drawn on the account. We are not liable to you for dishonoring Items where our action results in your account not having enough money to pay Checks and other Items.If you owe a debt to us or any of our affiliates (either now or in the future), you grant us a security interest in all your accounts to secure the debt. Debts include any fees you owe, as well as amounts owed us by another person or entity if you have guaranteed that you will pay their debts. If the debt is due or overdue, we may use the funds in any of your accounts to pay all or part of the debt. If your account is a joint account, we may use the funds in the joint account to pay the debt of any a ccount owner. Our security interest will be governed by Uniform Commercial Code Article 9, whether Article 9 applies by its terms or not. We do not have to give you any prior notice to apply the funds. You expressly agree that our rights extend to any electronically deposited federal or state benefit payments (including Social Security benefits). If you don’t want your benefits applied in this way, you may change your direct deposit instructions at any time with the person or organization paying the benefits. If any federal benefits or other payments are deposited to your Deposit Account after you become ineligible to receive them, we may set off against any of your accounts to recover the payments if we’re obligated to return funds to the payor. This security interest is in addition to our right of setoff against your Account. This section does not limit or reduce our rights under applicable law to charge or setoff funds in your Account with us for direct, indirect and acquired obligations you owe us.

Agreement to Arbitrate
‍
This section is referred to as the
Arbitration Agreement
. If you have a dispute with the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, and are not able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process set forth in this section.
‍
Arbitration
You agree that if you have a dispute, claim, or controversy (collectively, “Claim”) that has arisen or may arise between you and the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach), your Super.com Deposit Account and services provided under this Agreement, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, including any transaction or attempted transaction no matter the method or means, and you are not able to resolve the Claim informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the Claim will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
. “Claim” has the broadest possible meaning, and includes initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims. Among other things, it includes Claims based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud, constitutional law, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for injunctive or declaratory relief).
‍
Parties Subject to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
applies whenever there is a Claim between you (including your heirs, successors, representatives and beneficiaries) and us. If a third party, such as an Indemnified Party other than the Bank, is also involved in a Claim between you and us, or if a dispute arises between you and an Indemnified Party other than the Bank relating to this Agreement or your Super.com Deposit Account (including any additional, updated, or substitute account for the same accountholder(s)), then the Claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, in accordance with this
Arbitration Agreement
, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party.
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A COVERED BORROWER UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE COVERED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT, IN WHICH CASE THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, PLEASE CONTACT US AT FINPRODUCTSSUPPORT@SUPER.COM.
‍
Exclusions
You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so failing will bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration. Further, this
Arbitration Agreement
does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. In addition, the following will not be the subject of this
Arbitration Agreement
: (a) the exercising of any self-help rights, including set-off; (b) any action in court by that is limited to preventing the other party from using a self-help remedy, so long as it is prosecuted individually, and does not involve a request for damages or monetary relief of any kind; or (c) any other claims where arbitration is prohibited by law. Further, nothing herein shall prevent either you or us from applying to any court of competent jurisdiction for emergency provisional relief, such as a temporary restraining order, a temporary protective order, an attachment or any other pre-judgment remedies.
‍
Your Right to Opt Out
If you do not want this
Arbitration Agreement
to apply to your Super.com Deposit Account, you may opt out by sending us written notice of your decision within 30 days of the opening of your Super.com Deposit Account. Such notice must clearly state that you wish to cancel or opt out of the
Arbitration Agreement
section of this Agreement. It should include your name, address, Deposit Account Number, and your signature and must be and must be emailed to optout@super.com. This is the sole and only method by which you can opt out of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Your exercise of the right to opt-out will not affect any remaining terms of this Agreement and will not result in any adverse consequence to you or your Super.com Deposit Account. You agree that our business records will be final and conclusive evidence with respect to whether you canceled or opted out of this
Arbitration Agreement
in a timely and proper fashion.
‍
Prohibition and Waiver of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE BANK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
‍
Prohibition and Waiver of Court and Jury Trials
FOR CLAIMS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY DECIDE THE CLAIM.

OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
‍
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
‍
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at finproductssupport@super.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the Claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received at the Notice Address, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank or Indemnified Party is entitled.
‍
Arbitration Procedures
‍
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances or by Zoom or video/telephonic conference. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
Costs of Arbitration
‍
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) or less, at your request, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. You will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees, except that the arbitrator shall be entitled to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party in the arbitration if permitted by applicable law.
‍
Governing Law
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
involves interstate commerce and shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) to the fullest extent possible, notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, regardless of the origin or nature of the Claims at issue. The arbitrator must apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and claims of privilege recognized at law. Any Claims and defenses that can be asserted in court can be asserted in the arbitration. The arbitrator may award any remedy provided by the substantive law that would apply if the action were pending in court, including, without limitation, punitive damages (which shall be governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the courts) and injunctive, equitable and declaratory relief. The arbitrator shall follow the law and shall not be entitled to make errors of law. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the award.
‍
Arbitration Result and Right of Appeal
‍
Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Except as provided in applicable statutes, the arbitrator’s award is not subject to review by the court and it cannot be appealed, provided, however, that either party may appeal to any court with jurisdiction to the extent the arbitrator makes an error of law.
‍
Rules of Interpretation.
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
shall survive the closing of the Super.com Deposit Account, any legal proceeding and any bankruptcy to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this
Arbitration Agreement
, on the one hand, and the applicable arbitration rules or the other provisions of this Agreement, on the other hand, this
Arbitration Agreement
shall govern to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
‍
Confidentiality
‍
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
‍
Severability
‍
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to Claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Super.com Deposit Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).

How We Will Calculate Your Balance.
If we charge interest on your Card Balance, we will use the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” method to calculate the balance. To get the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” we take the beginning balance on the Card each day of the billing cycle, add any new purchases and any fees, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us a daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for each day in the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance (including new purchases).

You may ask us to lock any Card, and we may take other actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to protect the security of your Super.com Card, your Card Account or our systems.

‍
‍

We may refuse to process any transaction that we believe may violate the terms of this Charge Card Agreement or applicable law.

You also may be liable to us for any damages and/or expenses resulting from such use. Additionally, we may close your Card Account.
You agree that we may rely on information provided by merchants and your applicable payment network to categorize transactions.
‍
Preauthorizations.
If you use your Card at an automated fuel dispenser (“pay at the pump”), the merchant may pre-authorize the transaction amount up to seventy five dollars ($75.00) or more. If your Card is declined even though you have sufficient Available Credit, pay for your purchase inside with the cashier. If you use your Card at a restaurant, a hotel, or for similar purchases, the merchant may pre-authorize the transaction amount for the purchase amount plus up to twenty percent (20%) or more to ensure there are sufficient funds available to cover tips or incidental expenses incurred. Any pre-authorization amount will place a “hold” on your Available Credit in that amount until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of your purchase. Once the final payment amount is received, the pre-authorization amount on hold will be removed. It may take up to seven (7) Business Days or more for the hold to be removed. During the hold period, you will not have access to the pre-authorization amount. If you authorize a transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of Available Credit for up to thirty (30) calendar days or more.
‍
‍
Declined Transactions.
We may decline to authorize any transaction for any reason at our sole discretion. We are not responsible for any losses you incur if we do not authorize a transaction.

‍
‍

ATM transactions are treated as cash advance transactions which draw from the line of credit associated with your Card Account. It is not a withdrawal of cash from your Super.com Deposit Account. It is an extension of credit that must be repaid in accordance with this Charge Card Agreement. Any cash advance from an ATM terminal will be subject to any limitations set forth herein and the fees disclosed in the Truth in Lending Disclosures above, as well as any daily limits imposed by the ATM owner. You should not write your PIN on your Super.com Card or keep your PIN with your Super.com Card. Never share your PIN with anyone. When entering your PIN, be sure it cannot be observed by others, and do not enter your PIN into any terminal that appears to be modified or suspicious.

‍
LIMITS ON YOUR SUPER.COM CARD AND CARD ACCOUNT
‍
‍
Your Super.com Card has limits that are designed to help you spend no more than you are able to repay. The following limits apply to your use of your Card Account. You may not make any transactions that would cause you to exceed any of these limits. We will never authorize a transaction on your Card in an amount that exceeds the Available Balance in your Super.com Deposit Account. The Available Balance is the most up-to-date record of the amount of money immediately available for use or withdrawal in your Super.com Deposit Account that secures your obligations under this Charge Card Agreement. The Available Balance in your Super.Com Deposit Account, at any given time, is generally equal to the amount deposited into your Super.com Account less your Card Balance. Please see the Deposit Agreement governing your Super.com Deposit Account for more information on how we calculate your Available Balance and how funds are made available to you. This limit is designed to help you spend no more than you are able to repay using the funds in your Super.com Deposit Account. We will never authorize a transaction on your Super.com Card in an amount that exceeds your Available Credit. At any given time, your Available Credit is equal to the lesser of (a) the Available Balance in your Super.com Deposit Account or (b) the Credit Limit minus the unpaid Payment Due on the Super.com Card.
Your Credit Limit is five thousand dollars ($5,000)
. However, your Available Credit can change at any time; for example, when you make a deposit to your Super.com Deposit Account, make a transaction on your Card Account, or repay your Card Balance.
‍
‍
Keeping Track of Your Limits.
You can use the Super.com App, the Site, or contact customer service to view limit and balance information about our Super.com Card. While we do our best to provide the most up-to-date information about your Card Account, there may be some delay in reflecting new transactions, for reasons outside our control, such as network interruptions or delays by merchants in posting transactions, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information in the Super.com App, on the Super.com website, or by phone. You are responsible for keeping track of your Super.com Card Balance, Credit Limit, and Available Credit. Our general practice is to decline transactions that may cause you to exceed your Credit Limit or Available Credit. If we do honor these transactions, you are responsible for paying us back in full immediately, and these limits will not increase. We may increase or decrease your Credit Limit or Available Credit at any time, in our sole discretion. We are not required to extend credit up to your maximum Credit Limit, if it would cause you to exceed your Available Credit
‍
.
Effect of Payment on Credit Limit and Available Credit.
When we receive a payment and apply it to your Card Account from the Super.com Deposit Account associated with your Card Account, your Available Balance in the Super.com Deposit Account will be reduced by the amount of your payment, and your Available Credit on the Super.com Card will not increase.
‍
‍
Exceeding Your Limits.
If you make a transaction that causes you to exceed the Credit Limit or Available Credit on your Card Account, you agree to immediately make a payment on your Card or make a deposit to your Super.com Account such that you no longer exceed your Credit Limit or Available Credit. Our general practice is to decline any transaction that would cause you to exceed any limit applicable to your Super.com Card. Even if we have permitted you to exceed a limit before, we are not required to do it in the future. We determine the amount of your Available Balance for the purpose of deciding whether a transaction will cause you to exceed a limit only once per transaction, which determination may occur at any time between the time you authorize the transaction and when we decline the transaction or send a notice of the declined transaction.
‍
‍
Other Limits.
For security reasons, there are limits on the number, amount, frequency, and type of transactions you can make using your Super.com Card. Similarly, there are limits on your ability to use your Super.com Card with certain merchants or terminals. To protect the security of your Super.com Card, others’ accounts, and our systems, we may or may not disclose some or any of these limits or any changes to these limits unless required by applicable law. We may change these limits from time to time at our sole discretion with or without notice. We will notify you of any limits or changes to the limits as required by applicable law. In our discretion, we may from time to time permit you to make transactions in excess of these limits, but permission to exceed a transaction limit on one or more occasion(s) does not grant or guarantee future right or permission to exceed the transaction limits. Your rights under this Charge Card Agreement to make purchases, initiate transfers, and complete other transactions with your Super.com Card or Card Account are subject to this paragraph.
‍
‍
PURCHASE ASSURANCE
You may enable the Purchase Assurance feature at any time within the Super.com App or on the Site. This feature will not be available unless you have enabled it. If you attempt to make a purchase with your Super.com Card that exceeds the Available Credit applicable to your Card, and you have attached an external debit card (“
Linked Debit Card
”) to your Super.com Deposit Account, Super.com may, as a convenience to you and in its sole discretion, transfer the funds into your Super.com Deposit Account from your Linked Debit Card to cover the purchase (“
Purchase Assurance
”). When you access the Purchase Assurance feature, Super.com will transfer the amount necessary for you to make your purchase to your Super.com Deposit Account from your Linked Debit Card on file with us. Once you have elected to enable Purchase Assurance, you may subsequently revoke your authorization in the Super.com App or on the Site, or by calling our Customer Support Team at +1 (844) 461-2577 at least three (3) Business Days before the date of any Super.com Card transaction you make which would access the Purchase Assurance feature. There will be no fee for the first three (3) Purchase Assurance transfers in any given calendar month, and every transaction thereafter will generally be declined, however we will not charge a fee and we are not liable if we do not decline it. Purchase Assurance only is available when enabled and up to the amount of funds that are available in your Linked Debit Card. If you attempt to make a purchase which exceeds the amount of funds available in your Linked Debit Card, the transaction will be declined. By electing to enable Purchase Assurance, you authorize us to debit and/or credit your Linked Debit Card we have on file for you, every day, when you use the Purchase Assurance feature to complete a purchase using your Super.com Card, on or promptly after each date you authorize the Super.com Card transaction. The amount of each debit will be the amount needed to complete the transaction(s) you make on your Super.com Card; meaning, Super.com will transfer the difference of the transaction amount and your Available Credit. You acknowledge that, as applicable, the electronic authorization contained in this Section represents your written authorization for debit card transactions as provided herein and will remain in full force and effect until you notify us that you wish to revoke this authorization as described above. NOTE: Purchase Assurance entails transferring the difference of your Available Credit and the transaction amount in order to complete a Super.com Card purchase transaction. By way of example, if you have enrolled in Purchase Assurance and you currently have $10 of Available Credit on your Super.com Card, and you initiate a Super.com Card purchase transaction for $17, a transfer of $7 will be initiated from your Linked Debit Card to your Super.com Deposit Account at or around the time that the transaction is authorized in order to approve the Super.com Card purchase transaction.
‍
‍
PAYMENTS, INTEREST AND FEES
‍
Your Promise to Pay
. You promise to pay us all amounts due on your Super.com Card by each Payment Due Date set forth on each Statement.

We will treat transactions made without presenting a physical Super.com Card (such as transactions completed by mail, telephone, Internet, or mobile device) the same as if you used the Super.com Card in person. If you let someone else use your Super.com Card, you are responsible for all transactions that person makes, even if that person’s use exceeds their authority to use your Card Account or Super.com Card, whether or not you have notified us that the person will be using your Card Account. If you are responsible for paying any Payment Due, we may refuse to release you from liability until all of the Cards and other credit devices outstanding under the Card Account have been returned to us and you repay us the total Payment Due owed to us under the terms of this Charge Card Agreement.

Upon selecting Autopay, you authorize us to make recurring debits from your Super.com Deposit Account on each Auto Payment Date to satisfy the Payment Due set forth on each Statement. We will not debit more than the Payment Due. However, the amount we debit may be less than the Payment Due because payments, returned purchases, and other credits can reduce the Payment Due if they post to the Card Account between the Statement Date and the Auto Payment Date. You also authorize us to debit or credit your selected payment method as needed to correct any errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

All Transactions that post to your Card Account after the closing date of your Statement will appear on your next Statement. Please review each Statement carefully.

Under certain circumstances, the law may not require us to send or make available to you a Statement, or may prohibit us from doing so. If an event of default occurs under this Charge Card Agreement, we may, in our sole discretion, stop sending you Statements if we deem your Card Account uncollectible or if we institute delinquency collection proceedings.You may obtain receipts to maintain a record of your transactions.

‍
Agreement to Arbitrate
This section is referred to as the
Arbitration Agreement
. If you have a dispute with the Bank, Super.com, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Bank or Super.com, or any of their respective employees, officers, directors, agents or service providers (each, an “
Indemnified Party
” and collectively, the “
Indemnified Parties
”), and are not able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process set forth in this section.
Arbitration
You agree that if you have a dispute, claim, or controversy (collectively, “
Claim
”) that has arisen or may arise between you and the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, whether arising out of or relating to this Charge Card Agreement (including any alleged breach), your Card Account and services provided under this Charge Card Agreement, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, including any transaction or attempted transaction no matter the method or means, and you are not able to resolve the Claim informally, you and we agree that upon demand by you, the Bank or any other Indemnified Party, the Claim will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
. “
Claim
” has the broadest possible meaning, and includes initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims. Among other things, it includes Claims based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud, constitutional law, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for injunctive or declaratory relief).
‍
‍
Parties Subject to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
applies whenever there is a Claim between you (including your heirs, successors, representatives and beneficiaries) and us. If a third party, such as an Indemnified Party other than the Bank, is also involved in a Claim between you and us, or if a dispute arises between you and an Indemnified Party other than the Bank relating to this Charge Card Agreement or your Card Account (including any additional, updated, or substitute account for the same accountholder(s)), then the Claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, in accordance with this
Arbitration Agreement
, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party.

‍
‍
Exclusions
You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so failing will bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration. Further, this
Arbitration Agreement
does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. In addition, the following will not be the subject of this
Arbitration Agreement
: (a) the exercising of any self-help rights, including set-off; (b) any action in court by that is limited to preventing the other party from using a self-help remedy, so long as it is prosecuted individually, and does not involve a request for damages or monetary relief of any kind; or (c) any other claims where arbitration is prohibited by law. Further, nothing herein shall prevent either you or us from applying to any court of competent jurisdiction for emergency provisional relief, such as a temporary restraining order, a temporary protective order, an attachment or any other pre-judgment remedies.

Arbitration Agreement

Arbitration Agreement

ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
The Bank and Indemnified Parties are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by emailing customer support at finproductssupport@super.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“
Notice
”). The Notice to the Bank or Indemnified Party should be sent to 18 Bartol Street, Unit #159, San Francisco, California, 94133 (“
Notice Address
”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If you do not resolve the Claim with the Bank or Indemnified Party within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received at the Notice Address, you or the Bank or Indemnified Party, as applicable, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by any party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Bank or Indemnified Party is entitled.
‍
‍
Arbitration Procedures
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“
AAA
”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
Arbitration Agreement
. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
Arbitration Agreement
, the applicable terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
Arbitration Agreement
terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Charge Card Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
Arbitration Agreement
. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Charge Card Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless the parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances or by Zoom or video/telephonic conference. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
‍
‍
Costs of Arbitration
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “
Arbitration Fees
”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement
. If the value of the relief sought is seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) or less, at your request, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, the Bank or other Indemnified Party will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Bank will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. You will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees, except that the arbitrator shall be entitled to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party in the arbitration if permitted by applicable law.
‍
‍
Governing Law
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
involves interstate commerce and shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (the “
FAA
”) to the fullest extent possible, notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, regardless of the origin or nature of the Claims at issue. The arbitrator must apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and claims of privilege recognized at law. Any Claims and defenses that can be asserted in court can be asserted in the arbitration. The arbitrator may award any remedy provided by the substantive law that would apply if the action were pending in court, including, without limitation, punitive damages (which shall be governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the courts) and injunctive, equitable and declaratory relief. The arbitrator shall follow the law and shall not be entitled to make errors of law. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the award.
‍
‍
Arbitration Result and Right of Appeal
‍
Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Except as provided in applicable statutes, the arbitrator’s award is not subject to review by the court and it cannot be appealed, provided, however, that either party may appeal to any court with jurisdiction to the extent the arbitrator makes an error of law.
‍
‍
Rules of Interpretation.
‍
This
Arbitration Agreement
shall survive the closing of the Card Account, any legal proceeding and any bankruptcy to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this
Arbitration Agreement
, on the one hand, and the applicable arbitration rules or the other provisions of the Charge Card Agreement, on the other hand, this
Arbitration Agreement
shall govern to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
‍
‍
Confidentiality
‍
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
‍
‍
Severability
‍
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Arbitration Agreement
will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement
will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to Claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
Arbitration Agreement
will continue to apply.
‍
‍
Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
‍
Notwithstanding any provision in this Charge Card Agreement to the contrary, if the Bank makes any future change to this
Arbitration Agreement
(other than a change to the Notice Address) while you have a Card Account, you may reject any such change by sending the Bank written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute covered by this
Arbitration Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this
Arbitration Agreement
as of the date you first accepted this Charge Card Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Charge Card Agreement).

Super.com Secured Charge Card Autopay Authorization
Last Updated: Feb 6, 2025
‍
This Super.com Autopay Authorization (“Authorization”) is made between the cardholder (“you” and “your”) and Republic Bank & Trust Company (“we”, “us”, “our”) and sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of the Super.com Secured Charge Card (the “Super.com Card”) Autopay service, which enables you to automatically make your monthly payments on your Super.com Card from your Super.com Deposit Account.
‍
BY CHECKING THE CHECKBOX AND CLICKING THE “CONTINUE” BUTTON, YOU ARE AGREEING TO AUTHORIZE US OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS (INCLUDING SNAPMONEY, INC. (DBA SUPER.COM)) TO ELECTRONICALLY DEBIT THE FUNDS WE HAVE SECURED IN YOUR SUPER.COM DEPOSIT ACCOUNT ON A RECURRING BASIS TO PAY THE AMOUNT DUE ON YOUR SUPER.COM CARD ON THE AUTO PAYMENT DATE SHOWN EACH MONTH ON YOUR CARD STATEMENTS.
‍
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, PRINTED/SAVED, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AUTHORIZATION. WE WILL PROVIDE YOU A COPY OF THIS AUTHORIZATION IN THE SUPER.COM APP OR THROUGH THE SUPER.COM WEBSITE. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO MAKE RECURRING PAYMENTS, YOU SHOULD NOT CHECK THE CHECKBOX.
‍
WARNING
THE PAYMENTS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION WILL NOT BE DEBITED ON THE PAYMENT DUE DATE SHOWN ON YOUR SUPER.COM CARD STATEMENT.
THEY WILL BE DEBITED ON THE “AUTO PAYMENT DATE” SHOWN ON YOUR MOST RECENT SUPER.COM CARD STATEMENT, WHICH IS THE 11TH OF THE MONTH.
YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO MAKE YOUR PAYMENTS EARLY, AND IF YOU INSTEAD WISH TO PAY ON YOUR PAYMENT DUE DATE, YOU MAY DO SO BY OTHER MEANS.
‍
Authorization to Electronically Debit Your Bank Account or Card
. You authorize us to electronically debit your Super.com Deposit Account in U.S. Dollars on the Auto Payment Date indicated on your most recent Super.com Card Statement. As described in your Super.com Secured Charge Card Agreement, the Super.com Card is a charge card that requires you to repay the Statement Balance (appearing as the “New Balance”, “Auto Payment Amount”, and the “Payment Due” on your Statement) in full each month. The amounts of such debits will be the amounts specified on your Super.com Card Statement as the “Payment Due.”  You also authorize us to debit or credit your Super.com Deposit Account as needed to correct any errors, process returned and reversed payments, and similar issues, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
‍
You authorize the electronic debits to begin for the next Super.com Card Statement from the date you agreed to this Authorization. We will not debit more than the Payment Due. However, the amount we debit may be less than the Payment Due because payments, returned purchases, and other credits can reduce the Payment Due if they post to the account between the Statement Date and the date your Autopay payment is processed.
‍
Stopping Payment
. You understand that you may terminate this Authorization by contacting Super.com at 1 (844) 461-2577 or finproductssupport@super.com, in such time as to afford us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In any event, we will comply with a termination request received at least three (3) business days before the scheduled Auto Payment Date on which the termination is to be effective.
‍
Notice of varying amount
. If these recurring payments may vary in amount, we will notify you on your Super.com Card Statement at least 10 days before each Autopay, when the payment will be made and how much it will be.
‍
Liability for failure to stop payment
. If you tell us to stop a preauthorized automatic debit three (3) Business Days or more before the Auto Payment Date and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.
‍
Termination
. We may terminate this Authorization at any time for any reason, including excessive returned payments. This Authorization remains in full force and effect until you or we terminate it. If you cancel or we terminate this Authorization, you understand that you will be responsible for making your payments by another payment method.
Terminating this Authorization does not affect your duty to repay your underlying obligation.
‍
Optional Nature or Authorization
. You acknowledge that you are not required to use Autopay to obtain or access the Super.com Card.
‍
Miscellaneous
. You promise that you are the authorized signer on the Super.com Deposit Account. You understand that this Authorization is subject to applicable law and network rules.
‍

Super.com Cashback Addendum
This Addendum to the Super.com Secured Credit Card Agreement (this “Addendum”) pertaining to the Super.com Card cashback rewards program (the “Super.com Cashback Program” or the “Program”) is between you and Republic Bank & Trust Company, Member FDIC (“Bank,” or “Republic Bank” and, together with the Bank’s agents, successors, assignees and third-party service providers, “we”, “us,” and “our”).
‍
1. General.
Unless separately defined herein, terms in this Addendum shall have the same meaning as defined in your Super.com Secured Charge Card Agreement (the “Agreement”). The Agreement governs use of the Super.com Card and the Super.com Account, and the Agreement controls with respect to any matters involving the Super.com Card and the Super.com Account; provided, this Addendum will govern in any matter relating exclusively to the Super.com Cashback Program.
‍
‍
For any Super+ Member, the Super.com Account will be automatically enrolled in the Super.com Cashback Program when a Super.com Card is activated or the Super.com Account is used. By activating a Super.com Card or using the Super.com Account, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Addendum. At the sole discretion of Bank, if an enrolled Super.com Card is found to be used in a prohibited manner, Bank may terminate your Program enrollment.
‍
‍
2. How to Earn Super.com Cashback.
“Super.com Cashback” rewards are earned by Super+ Members when purchases are made with your Super.com Card anywhere Mastercard credit cards are accepted in accordance with the following:
‍
The Super.com Account will earn 10% cashback for every dollar spent on hotel booking purchases on the Site or in the Super.com App. Such purchases must be made with your Super.com Card, and Super.com must be the Merchant of Record; and
‍
The Super.com Account will earn 1% cashback for every dollar spent with your Super.com Card on all other credit purchases.
‍
3. Purchase Limitations and Adjustments
. A “purchase” is a charge for goods or services. The following transactions are not considered purchases for purposes of the Super.com Cashback Program and will not earn Super.com Cashback rewards: balance transfers, cash advances, cash-like items, taxes, peer-to-peer transfers, finance charges, unauthorized or fraudulent transactions, and fees of any kind. We reserve the right to determine whether a particular transaction is a qualifying transaction for purposes of what constitutes a purchase for the Program. If a refund or credit to the Super.com Card is initiated in connection with any purchase on which Super.com Cashback rewards were earned, your Super.com Cashback balance will be reduced by the number of Super.com Cashback rewards previously earned in connection with such returned or refunded purchase.
‍
Super.com Cashback will be earned in accordance with the applicable merchant’s categorization of purchases. Please note that merchants self-select the category in which purchases will be identified, and some merchants may be owned by other companies. Therefore, purchase transactions may not be categorized in the manner you expect. We are not responsible for any merchant’s categorization of a purchase.
‍
Purchases that are conducted through online or third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, virtual wallets or similar technology may not be eligible for cashback if the technology does not provide sufficient transaction details for cashback qualification.
‍
Each purchase made on a Super.com Card is eligible for only a single Super.com Cashback reward. Super.com Cashback rewards cannot be combined.
‍
‍
4. Special Offer for New Accounts.
We may offer promotional cashback for new accounts. Individual offers cannot be combined with any other offer or promotion of the Super.com Cashback Program. You will be eligible for only one offer per User Account during the offer period. Some restrictions will apply. The terms for a promotional offer will vary by promotional campaign and can be changed or discontinued at any time without notice. Republic Bank is not associated with any special cashback offers.
‍
‍
5. Terms
.
‍
For so long as you remain a Super+ Member, Super.com Cashback rewards earned will be deposited into the Cardholder’s virtual cashback rewards wallet (the “Rewards Wallet”) daily. Super.com Cashback rewards will be applied to the Super.com Card only after the purchase has fully posted to the cardholder’s Super.com Card. If a purchase remains pending and does not post until after the end of the cardholder’s current billing period, the Cardholder’s Super.com Cashback rewards will be deposited into their Super.com Account at the end of the billing period following the purchase’s full posting to their Super.com Card.
In the event a purchase is returned, canceled or voided after the Super.com Cashback rewards have been deposited into the Cardholder’s Reward Wallet and the Cardholder stops using their Super.com Card or ceases to be a Super+ Member and thus stops accruing Super.com Cashback rewards, Super.com will recover the Super.com Cashback rewards by the following methods: Super.com will first attempt to debit the amount from the Cardholder’s Rewards Wallet (assuming there is an adequate amount within the Rewards Wallet), or if the first option fails and there is an insufficient balance in the Cardholder’s Rewards Wallet, Super.com will debit the previously awarded Super.com Cashback rewards associated with the returned, canceled or voided purchase from the Cardholder’s Super.com Account.
The Cardholder must transfer their cashback from their Rewards Wallet to the Digital Wallet in order for the Super.com Cashback rewards to be available for purchases, subject to the following redemption limitations: $200 daily,  $250 weekly, and $1000 monthly. Negative balances may not be carried in the Rewards Wallet. There is no cap or expiration on Super.com Cashback rewards so long as you remain a Super+ Member and have a Super.com Account. However, should your Super.com Account be closed for any reason, your Cashback rewards will be forfeited. The Cardholder may use the cashback for: (i) Purchases; (ii) Cash Withdrawals; or (iii) Balance Payments.
No Cardholder may access their Rewards Wallet or the Super.com Cashback rewards if their Super.com Card possesses a delinquent status. The Cardholder will be granted renewed access to their Rewards Wallet once their Super.com Card’s delinquency is cured and your Super.com Card is current.
It is your responsibility to regularly monitor your Rewards Wallet and Digital Wallet to ensure that every earning of Cashback rewards and every redemption of such rewards is proper and accurate. It is also your obligation to timely report each and every suspected improper, unauthorized, or inaccurate Cashback rewards earnings, transfer from your Rewards Wallet, or redemption from your Digital Wallet. Timely reporting means no more than sixty (60) days after Cashback rewards earnings are posted to the Rewards Wallet or redemptions are made from your Digital Wallet, respectively.
‍
6. Other Limitations
. We reserve the right to interpret the Program rules and policies, including the provisions of this Addendum, in our sole discretion and will be the final authority on the Super.com Cashback Program. This Addendum, including the percentages of cashback and terms applicable to cashback are subject to change at any time for any reason, at our sole discretion. It is your responsibility to check this Addendum from time to time to understand the cashback rewards applicable to your use of your Super.com Account. Unless or until the Super.com Cashback rewards are redeemed in accordance with this Addendum, you have no right, title, or interest in the earned Super.com Cashback rewards.
‍
‍
7. Termination; Notice of Changes
. We may modify, restrict, cancel, suspend, or terminate the Program at any time without compensation or prior notice to you, except as required by law. In the event the Super.com Cashback Program, your participation in the Program, or the Super.com Account is terminated or canceled by us, earned, but not redeemed Super.com Cashback rewards will be forfeited, except as required by law. All material changes to the Super.com Cashback Program will be reflected in this Addendum and will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Addendum to the Site. You waive any right to receive specific notice of such changes, subject to applicable law.
‍
‍
8. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability
. The Super.com Cashback Program is provided without representation or warranty of any kind, either express or implied, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Neither we, Card Services, nor any other service provider will be liable for any damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, direct, indirect, special, consequential, incidental, punitive damages or any other losses or expenses arising in connection with participation in the Program. You agree to release, discharge and hold harmless us, Super.com, and any other service providers from any and all claims of any sort, type, kind or nature that you may have arising out of or in any way relating to your participation in the Super.com Cashback Program or with respect to any Super.com Cashback rewards, including (but not limited to) claims for or due to personal injury, property damage, accident, sickness, delay, cancellation, postponement, inconvenience, penalty, fines, fees, refunds or other irregularities that may occur, are related to, or that may be caused by or arise out of participation in the Program.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to

about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and MoneyLion may share this aggregated data with MoneyLion Related Companies, and with its agents, service providers, marketplace partners, and other third parties with whom we do business.  This includes, but is not limited to, information such as consumer financial trends, choices, and comparisons. We may also use aggregated information from these sources to create similar audiences in order to better target advertisements on third-party advertising and social media networks to potential consumers who appear to have shared characteristics. MoneyLion may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective marketplace partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. This aggregated information does not identify you personally. We will not attempt to re-identify the data once in aggregated or non-personally identifiable form.
HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may disclose your Personal Information to the following categories of recipients for our business or commercial purposes:
A) MONEYLION RELATED COMPANIES:
We may disclose your Personal Information to MoneyLion Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy (including for marketing and advertising purposes).
B) THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS:
MoneyLion, like many businesses, hires other companies and contractors to provide certain business-related services (for example, verifying your identity, facilitating mailings, maintaining databases, providing customer service, cloud storage providers, and business analytics and marketing providers). We
may also disclose this information to consumer reporting agencies, acting in a service provider capacity, as part of data studies intended to test the reliability of our internal data and to improve the quality of our Services. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, and we ensure that we have appropriate contractual provisions in place to protect your Personal Information.
C) BUSINESS PARTNERS:
When we partner with other businesses to provide content, products, or services to you or to such business partners, we may disclose relevant Personal Information in connection with such content, products, or services. For example, when you enable our Driver Score feature, your location information is disclosed to Zendrive, our automobile insurance partner, in order to track your driving habits to seek out automobile insurance discounts and savings. Or, when you use our “Products and Services” offering to search for financial products or services from our marketplace partners, we will disclose the information you provide when using these services to marketplace partners whose pre-qualification criteria you may satisfy. In addition, we may provide summarized purchase information, on an aggregated and anonymized basis, to marketplace partners in order to support the accuracy of their financial and business analytics. We may also share this information with marketplace partners to improve efforts to target appropriate advertising content to you.
D) CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES:
We may disclose basic Personal Information to consumer reporting agencies, either for purposes of completing a “soft” credit inquiry with your authorization, or as part of data studies, with the consumer reporting agencies acting in a service provider capacity, which are intended to test the reliability of our internal data and improve the quality of our Services.
E) POTENTIAL PARTIES TO A CORPORATE TRANSACTION (AND THEIR AGENTS AND ADVISORS):
We may disclose your Personal Information to actual or potential buyers (and their agents and advisors) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger, acquisition, reorganization, financing, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider. In this event, we will inform the transferee that it must use your Personal Information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
F) LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES, REGULATORS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, COURTS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES:
We may disclose your Personal Information to competent law enforcement bodies, regulators, our insurers, external legal advisors, government agencies, courts, or other third parties where we believe disclosure is necessary: (i) to comply with applicable law; (ii) to exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights; (iii) to protect your rights or vital interests or those or any other person; or (iv) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address security, fraud, or technical issues.

When we are no longer required to retain the Personal Information as described above, we will destroy, erase, or de-identify it. Legal data retention requirements, however, may require us to retain some or all of the Personal Information we hold for certain periods of time.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY ONLINE:
MoneyLion Services are not directed to, or intended for, minors. MoneyLion does not knowingly collect Personal Information from minors. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their minor children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their minor children never to provide Personal Information on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a minor has provided Personal Information to MoneyLion through the Services, please contact us, and we will delete that information from our databases.
LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES:
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by MoneyLion (the “
Third-Party Sites
”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third-Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that MoneyLion endorses or has reviewed the Third-Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
SECURITY:
We take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards (which vary depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information) designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access to Personal Information, and we regularly adapt these controls to respond to changing requirements and advances in technology.
However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. If you are, or believe you have become, a victim of identity theft, you may visit the website of the Federal Trade Commission at
https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/
for free information to help guard against identity theft and guidance on the recovery steps you can take.
SERVICE FOR U.S. USERS ONLY:
The Service is hosted and intended solely for consumers in the United States. All Personal Information is stored on servers in the United States and is subject to United States law.
If you are visiting the Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to the United States and the global processing of such information. By providing your Personal Information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
UPDATES TO MONEYLION’S PRIVACY POLICY:
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our businesses and to account for changing privacy laws. We will obtain your consent to any material changes if and where this is required by applicable laws. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE:
From time to time, we may offer the opportunity to enter Promotions subject to program-specific rules. Because you would be required to provide personal information (typically contact information) to opt into these Promotions and receive the opportunity to earn rewards, these offers may be considered “financial incentives” under applicable law.
You may opt into Promotions by submitting an entry form. You have the right to withdraw from a Promotion at any time by contacting us at
optout@moneylion.com

YOUR STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS/NOTICE AT COLLECTION
This section discusses applicable privacy rights as required by certain U.S. state privacy laws, including California, Oregon, and other future U.S. states that pass privacy legislation to which we are subject.  This section includes our Notice at Collection for California residents, including those with whom we interact in our business-to-business relationships. To understand the types of Personal Information we collect, and how they are sold and shared, please view
Appendix A
. We will retain your Personal Information as described under “Data Retention”. To view our full Privacy Policy, please

. We do not sell your Personal Information, but we do “share” your Personal Information as defined under California law. To review your Notice of Right to Opt-Out, please

.
Because we are a financial institution regulated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Personal Information that we collect in connection with your request for consumer financial products and services constitutes “nonpublic personal information” subject to our
Financial Privacy Notice
, and we may be exempt from certain state privacy laws. In light of these exemptions, this Notice does not apply to the collection, processing, sale, or disclosure of any information (i) that a consumer provides to us to obtain a financial product or service, (ii) about a consumer resulting from any transaction involving a financial product or service; (iii) about a consumer resulting from a consumer’s express direction to disclose the consumer’s information; or (iv) that we otherwise obtain about a consumer in connection with providing a financial product or service to that consumer. For information about our data collection practices in those contexts, please refer to our
Financial Privacy Notice
.
The definition of “Personal Information” may be different under individual state laws and regulations. As used in this Notice only, “Personal Information” refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual.
