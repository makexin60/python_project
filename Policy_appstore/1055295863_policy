Thank you for using Today!
We are Neybox Digital Ltd., the operators of the app named Today: Habit Tracker (or just “Today”). Our mission is to help you develop good habits and quit bad ones. We care deeply about your privacy, and we always want to be completely transparent about the way Today handles your personal data. This document is our Privacy Policy, and by using Today, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy so please read this document carefully. Because we’re an app development company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. You can contact us at any time if you have any questions and comments about this Privacy Policy.
What information we collect and how we use it
Today does not require any form of registration or the creation of a personal user account to use it.
Apple Health data
Today will also ask for your explicit permission to access specific categories of health data that are stored on your device by Apple Health. If you allow Today to access those categories of data, then Today will process that data to show one or more graphs of those data.
Any data processing of your health data will only take place in the devices that you use to run Today. Today will not store or cache any of the health data that it will access from Apple Health and it will not transmit this data to any external server either owned by Neybox Digital Ltd. or any other third party. We will not share or sell your Health Data to advertising platforms, affiliate networks, data brokers or information resellers. We will not use your Health Data for advertising, promotion, cross-selling or any similar service.
Backups using iCloud and Dropbox
If you enable the backup feature in Today, then Today will transmit your entire database and all the photos that you have stored in Today (either as photo covers or additions to your any Photo Gallery cards) on your personal iCloud or Dropbox storage space on the Internet. No data from Apple Health will be transmitted or stored on your iCloud or Dropbox account. Neybox does not have access to the data stored at any time.  We will not share or transmit any of your personal data with any other third-party service.
Anonymous usage data and third-party analytics
We may use third-party services in Today, to help us respond to support requests, detect and diagnose any potential issues and understand how Today is used so that we can improve your overall experience with Today. We never share any of your habit data or health data with any of those services. Those third-party services may use and store anonymous data such as the IP addresses or device identifiers of the devices, device characteristics, location data, app version of Today that you use, the iOS version that your device is running on and if you have access to our premium features. If any of those services require your name or email address, for example in case you want to contact our support team, then those services will ask you explicitly to share this information.
When you contact our Support & Feedback center, or you send us an email, one or more of our support representatives or employees at Neybox Digital Ltd. might have access to your name, email and contents of that email or email you have exchanged with us as you have provided it through the available contact forms provided either inside Today or the webpage of our Support and Feedback center.
What choices do you have about your information?
Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. Many of the choices you have on Today are built directly into the product or can be controlled by the Settings app that.
