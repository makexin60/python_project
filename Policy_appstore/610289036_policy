How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on

or

data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also

or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

We recommend that you read their privacy notices and contact them directly if you have any concerns regarding their use of your Personal Information.

email address,
device information about your device you use to access the Site,

2. How we collect information
We collect information from you or about you when you provide this information to us directly.  For example, we may obtain information when you request products or services from us, respond to surveys, contact customer support or otherwise interact with us via a Site, or via any of our social media channels.
In addition, when you interact with our Sites, we may collect information through technology, such as cookies. See the

3. Our use of cookies
Cookies are pieces of information that are stored directly on the device that you are using. For further information about how we use cookies please see our

We will only collect, use and share your Personal Information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this. This may be because:
our use of your Personal Information is in our legitimate interest as a commercial organisation, for example to contact you when you submit a query or complaint on our website; to offer you other products and services and sell to you products and services offered by us, our affiliates or third parties; to follow up with you and investigate your query or complaint (as applicable), administer promotions and surveys, make improvements to our products and services, undertake market research into the users of our Sites, and to detect fraud and other illegal activity. In these cases we will look after your information at all times in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights and you have a right to object to processing as explained in the Your Legal Rights section below;
our use of your Personal Information is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have.
5. What happens if you do not provide the personal information that we request
We need some of your Personal Information in order to contact you and follow up with you in respect of the query or complaint you have submitted on our website. For example, we need to know your personal contact details to identify you and contact you.
Where information is needed for these purposes, if you do not provide it we will not be able to contact you and follow up with you in respect of the query or complaint you have submitted on our website. We explain when this is the case at the point where we collect information from you.
6. Who do we share your information with
Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose Personal Information collected through the Site to any companies not part of U.S. Bank Europe or its parent (including its subsidiaries), subsidiaries or any other related entities.  Although, as disclosed below, we may provide some Personal Information to certain business partners, co-marketers and other third parties, in no event will we sell or rent your Personal Information as part of a customer list or similar transaction.
SERVICE PROVIDERS.  We may share Personal and Other Information with agents, subsidiaries, affiliates (certain of our services are provided to you by our affiliates), partners and other third parties that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing, content management tools, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, etc.  These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information.  The Service Providers are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services.
BUSINESS PARTNERS.  We provide products and services to customers through a number of affiliated banks and companies.  We may share your Personal Information with our business partners or other third parties that enable us to serve your processing needs.  We may contact our existing customers by mail, telephone, or email to offer additional products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  Although our treatment of your Personal Information is governed by this Privacy Policy, the business partner or third party’s treatment of your Personal Information will be governed by the business partner or third party’s privacy policy. You have the right to withdraw to any such promotional activity at any time as described in the Your Legal Rights section below.
REGULATORY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES.  We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Site; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Site or our users, or (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Site or the public.
BUSINESS PURCHASERS. We may change our ownership or corporate organisation while providing the Site and services or sell certain assets associated with the Site. As a result, please be aware that in such event and to the extent permitted by law we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged.
SHARING OTHER INFORMATION.  To the extent permitted under applicable local laws, we may disclose or share Other Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. Among other things, we may disclose Other Information to third parties to help us determine how people use parts of the Site and who our users are so we can improve the Site.
7. What steps do we take to keep personal information secure
The security of your information is important to us.  information collected by the Site is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public.  We therefore restrict access to your information to those of our employees who need to know that information to provide products and services to you. We have established physical, technical and administrative security processes that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the information collected to safeguard Personal Information. We have routine internal and external oversight practices in place to assess and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your information.
Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you. In certain telephone and in person transactions we may ask for your account number or other information to verify your identity before conducting the transactions you have requested.
Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We review our security procedures to consider appropriate technology and methods to secure information.
8. For how long de we keep personal information
As a general rule, U.S. Bank Europe will not keep your information for longer than is necessary.
If you submit a query and you are a merchant of ours, we will keep your information for as long as we have a contract with you and for as long as we need your information for regulatory or evidential purposes after expiry or termination of your contract.
If you submit a query or complaint on our website, we will keep your Personal Information while we progress your query or complaint. For non-customers, this information will not be retained for longer than necessary and not for a period longer than 12 months.  For retention practices in relation to Cookie’s please refer to the
Cookie Policy
.
However, where we have statutory obligations to keep Personal Information for a longer period or where we may need your Personal Information for a longer period in case of a legal claim, then the retention period may be longer. For more information on retention please Contact Us using the details below.
9. Transferring information
U.S. Bank Europe operates on a global basis. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred and stored in countries outside the United Kingdom and European Economic Area that are subject to different standards of data protection. We will take appropriate steps ensure that transfers of Personal Information are in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and transfers are limited to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangement are in place to protect your privacy rights. To this end:
we ensure where we transfer your Personal Information outside U.S. Bank Europe or to third parties who help provide our products and services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Information, in particular through standard data protection model clauses adopted by the European Commission and appropriate transfer mechanism adopted under United Kingdom law (if applicable); or
where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any Personal Information are disclosed.
You have a right to Contact Us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your Personal Information when this is transferred as mentioned above.

a right to ask for a copy of your Personal Information;
a right to ask us to delete or correct any Personal Information we hold about you that is inaccurate;
