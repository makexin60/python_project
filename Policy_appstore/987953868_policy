Our Privacy Policy
Your and your children's privacy is important to us!
Therefore we are not using, collecting or saving any personal data recorded on the applications at any time!
All app specific information that might be needed e.g. individual settings or progress, is stored as non-personal and only on your device. However, we also may request your location or access to your photo library, but it’s only to activate special features that take advantage of your device’s interactivity within the app.
                        That information is not processed by us – it will be used only to support the requested task, for example, displaying your location within the app or saving an image to your device.
We also do not collect analytics data from the app.
If you have any questions, please email us at info@urbn-pockets.com.
