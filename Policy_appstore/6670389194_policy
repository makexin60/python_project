Introduction
BodyMax, operated by GOTECH Dijital Hizmetler Anonim Sirketi ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), 
        is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and 
        share information about you when you use BodyMax ("App"), a photo editor powered by AI designed to 
        enhance muscle definition in images you upload.
Information We Collect
1. Personal Information
We collect personal information that you provide directly to us, such as your name and email address 
        when you sign up for BodyMax or contact us for support.
2. Photographs
When using BodyMax, you upload photographs for processing. These photographs may contain facial data 
        or other sensitive personal details. We collect and process this data solely to provide the muscle enhancement 
        feature of the app, such as increasing muscle size and enhancing definition.
No Photo Storage:
We do not store any photos. Once a photo is processed and the enhanced image is sent back to you, it is immediately deleted from our systems.
No Full Access to Photo Album:
Even if you grant the App permission to access your photo library, we only collect and process the specific photos you select for editing.
Photo Metadata:
We do not intentionally collect or process metadata (e.g., geotags) associated with your photos.
3. Device and Usage Information
We collect information about your interactions with the App, such as the features you use, your usage patterns, 
        and your device details, including operating system, hardware model, and IP address.
How We Use Your Information
Photo Processing:
We use the photographs you upload solely to provide the muscle enhancement functionality of BodyMax. Once processing is complete, the enhanced image is sent back to you, and the original image is deleted.
Improving the App:
We use other collected data, like app usage and device information, to improve the App's performance and features.
Communication:
We may contact you for app updates or promotional materials if youâ€™ve provided your email address.
Sharing Your Information
Third-Party Service Providers:
We use third-party cloud services like Firebase and Runpod to process photos. These service providers are only allowed to use your information as needed to provide these services on our behalf.
Legal Requirements:
We may disclose your information as required by law or in response to valid requests from public authorities.
Business Transfers:
If we undergo a merger or acquisition, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
Data Retention
Photos:
We do not store any images. Photos are processed and deleted immediately after the processed image is sent back to the user.
Personal Information:
We retain your personal information as long as necessary to provide the App's services unless a longer retention period is required by law.
Data Security
We take reasonable measures, including encryption and secure processing, to protect your personal information 
        and photographs from unauthorized access.
