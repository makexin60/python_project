(2) the processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures.
In exercising this right, you also have the right to have the personal data concerning you transferred directly from one controller to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons must not be affected by this.
The right to data portability does not apply to processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.

16.9. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This does not apply if the decision
(1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the controller,
(2) is permitted by legal provisions of the Union or the member states to which the controller is subject and these legal provisions contain appropriate measures to protect your rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests or
(3) is carried out with your express consent.
However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data according to Art. 9 (1) GDPR, unless Art. 9 (2) (a) or (g) GDPR applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests.
With regard to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the controller shall take reasonable measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as the legitimate interests of the data subject, which shall include, at least, the right to obtain the intervention of a person of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.
16.10. Right to complain to a supervisory authority
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of your residence, place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.
The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Art. 78 GDPR.
