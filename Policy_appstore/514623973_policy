Even if you don't collect information from users directly, such as a through a contact form, you may still be legally required to have a Privacy Policy because your website or app uses third-party libraries that may collect user data.
You need a Privacy Policy if you ask personal data from users through forms (email address, name)
You need a Privacy Policy if you use tools from Google, such as Google Analytics or Google AdWords.
