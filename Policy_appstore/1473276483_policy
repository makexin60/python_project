QST
Submitting Survey Sessions This cookies enforces the “Prevent multiple submissions” setting in survey options. It only appears once a survey session has been submitted. Whenever a survey is taken, a session cookie is dropped, with the expiration date matching with whatever is set for the incomplete survey responses setting in survey options. So, for example, if my Incomplete survey responses setting is set to 1 week, the survey will drop a session cookie that expires one week from when I clicked the survey link. This cookie allows Qualtrics to keep track of when an incomplete survey should be recorded as a response. If the survey remains incomplete, this cookie will stay here until it expires. However, if the survey is submitted, it will transform into the QST (Qualtrics Survey Tracker) cookie.
