Frequently asked questions
Why isn't there an eraser?
Deliberate design choice - you can't erase ink! I'm still on the fence on this one, I'll probably put one in
I think I've found a bug or have an idea for an improvement, what do I do?
You can send an email to me at support@accidentalfish.com and I'll see if I can help.
Are you planning on adding more features?
Yeah probably, a few more simple ones but I don't want this to become a complex app.
