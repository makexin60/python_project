We respect your right to privacy and understand that, as a user of any Code Conical (MARK MANSER) App, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences.
When you provide Code Conical with any personal data and you do not 'opt out,' Code Conical may use the provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, product releases, and other Code Conical information. Code Conical does not allow the selling of any user-provided information to third parties.
Code Conical respects the rights users give us when opting to receive email communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users.
Code Conical may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you use our App. These companies may use information (NOT including your name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit networkadvertising.org.
How Code Conical will protect your personal information
Code Conical will always protect the personal information that you share with us. Code Conical stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment.
If Code Conical requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone numbers, email addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.
