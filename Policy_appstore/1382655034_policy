DERE EVIL EXE Privacy Policy
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application
DERE EVIL EXE
(“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Darius Immanuel D. Guerrero, CEO of AppSir, Inc. The Application is a platformer mobile game.
What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
User Provided Information
The developer of the Application does not obtain information provided by user. There is no registration required to use the Application. The developer will not obtain personally identifiable information from the users of the application.
However, third party advertising networks may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application.
We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the game. Advertisers obtain these information in an anonymous form. Advertisers use the device's Advertising Identifier, which is a unique ID for each device and is the only way to offer ads. This app uses the Advertising Identifier to
Serve advertisements within the app
Attribute this app installation to a previously served advertisement
Attribute an action taken within this app to a previously served advertisement
These information are then transmitted to the third party partners.
Our third party partners, and their privacy policies are as follows:
Admob
https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en
This app does not use Advertising Identifier, and any information obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier, in any way other than for limited advertising purposes.
Contact us
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at hello@appsirgames.com or use the contact form at the bottom of our homepage.
Policy Updates
This Policy may change from time to time. The most current version of our Privacy Policy can be found at this web page.

California Online
Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first
state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to
require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website

COPPA (Children Online
Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal
information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
protect children's privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically
market to children under the age of 13 years old.
Fair Information
Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles form
the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and
how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy
laws that protect personal information.
In order to be in line
with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
should a data breach occur:
We will notify you via
email
• Within
7 business days
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data
collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,
but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
CAN SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules
for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives
recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells
out tough penalties for violations.
We collect your email
address in order to:
• Market
to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the
original transaction has occurred.
To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
• Not
use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
• Identify
the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
• Include
the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
• Monitor
third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
