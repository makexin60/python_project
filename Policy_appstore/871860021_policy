Personal information you choose to provide
You may provide personal information to us, such as your first and last name, contact information, email address, and contents of your communication. If you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.
Website use information
Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes cookies and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and the websites visited just before and just after our website.

More Privacy Policy Templates
If You Use the Standard Features of Google Analytics
Google Analytics stores
cookies
on your users' PCs to keep track of usage data. This is enough to evoke the requirement of a Privacy Policy according to the
EU Cookies Directive
. The EU's
GDPR
also requires a Privacy Policy when usage data is collected, such as through cookies.
When you use Google Analytics, you can opt-in to getting access to analytics and usage data
plus
advertising features that allow you to create better marketing campaigns. The use of these features that include retargeting
triggers the requirement to update your Privacy Policy
to inform users about your usage of retargeting identifiers through Google's network.
In the
Google Analytics
Terms of Service agreement there's a requirement that users of Google Analytics must have a Privacy Policy agreement in place.
There are a few things you need to do if you take advantage of the standard features offered by Google Analytics. We'll review them now and show you how to implement them.
Disclose the Use of Google Analytics in Your Privacy Policy
The Privacy Policy must
disclose that analytics is used
,
disclose how data is collected and processed
, and
provide notice of the use of cookies
.
Here's the clause in the Terms of Service agreement that sets forth these requirements and provides suggestions for meeting them:
Your Privacy Policy should be easily accessible to visitors directly from your website or mobile app, such as in a footer link or mobile app "About" menu.
This makes it easy for users to locate and view your agreement whenever they want to.
Here's an example of how
Upwork
includes a link to its Privacy Policy and other legal agreements in its website footer:
Because so many businesses place their legal agreement links in their website footer, people know to check there.
You can also include a pop-up or banner message, such as the one in the image below, that tells your users that cookies are in use. Include a link to your Privacy Policy (and Cookie Policy) in this pop-up or banner message to make sure relevant information is easily accessible:
Include information about your use of Analytics cookies in your Privacy or Cookie Policy and make it clear that you're using Google Analytics to gain insights and improve the functionality of your website, or for marketing purposes.
Here's how
Indeed.com
does this in a clause in its Cookie Policy:
Give users the ability to opt out of having cookies placed for the purposes of Google Analytics and let them know that they have this right
.
There's an
opt-out browser add-on
from Google that helps make opting out incredibly easy and convenient for users. You can mention and link to this add-on in your Privacy Policy:
Disclose the Use of Remarketing Features in Your Privacy Policy
If you use the Google Analytics Remarketing Lists feature, you're required to agree to the Google Analytics Terms of Service. These Terms
require you
to have an informative Privacy Policy that discloses that
Google Analytics Remarketing
uses cookies to track users who visit your website or use your mobile app and display your ads to these users when they are on other websites.
While the exact language you should include isn't provided by Google, you should focus on being clear, concise, and informative.
Here's a checklist of what to include in your agreement:
Let users know that you use remarketing and that this will advertise your company or website across other websites that users visit.
Let users know that Google and other third-party vendors will show your ads on websites that users visit after visiting your website.
Let users know that your ads will be shown on other websites because the user visited your website in the past.
Let users know how they can opt out of this remarketing campaign through the Google Ad Settings page.
Here's a clause from
NextRoll's
Privacy Notice that's a great example of how to let users know all of this information:
Another clause in the Privacy Notice addresses how users can opt out of or adjust targeted ads and the use of their personal data:
NextRoll provides an
AdChoices
feature where a user can adjust advertising preferences quickly and easily. It's linked in the website footer:
Users who click on the link are taken to a screen where they are given the ability to adjust individual ad remarketing settings. Consent can be revoked or granted for all advertising and analytics cookies with one click, or individually adjusted:
If you use NextRoll, AdWords, or a different remarketing tool, you can add a link on your website to a page or module like this. Having something like this one is a great way to allow your users to choose which cookies they wish to allow and opt out of behavioral ads if they want to.
If You Use the Advertising Features of Google Analytics
If you choose to enable remarketing or any of the Google Analytics Advertising features, Google requires that you notify your visitors by disclosing the following
3 main points
in your Privacy Policy, as stated in the Policy Requirements from
Google
:
Google Analytics Advertising tools
lets you take the usage data and information you obtain from Google Analytics and
use it for advertising purposes
.
Remarketing
, also known as retargeting, is a widely used and incredibly popular function of Google Analytics.
In November 2023, Google released
Consent Mode V2
, a new way for businesses to communicate EEA and UK users' consent choices regarding the use of their personal data for advertising purposes to Google.
To comply with the new requirement, you'll need to implement Consent Mode V2 by March 2024.
We've updated our
Free Cookie Consent
to work with Google Consent Mode V2.
Here's how you can integrate our Free Cookie Consent with the new Consent Mode V2:
Create the gtag function with the default consent states as denied:
Load the Google Analytics/Tag Manager script:
Communicate user consent status using Cookie Consent callbacks:
These instructions can be found on our
Cookie Consent & Google Consent Mode V2
page. We also have a
video walkthrough on how
to integrate a cookie notice banner with Consent Mode V2.
Google Analytics Advertising Features
Which Google Analytics Advertising Features have you implemented?
In your Privacy Policy, include a list of all features and links to more information about each of the features you have implemented for your website so that users can be aware of them.
For example, if you use Google AdWords for remarketing purposes, declare this and consider including links to both
Google's Remarketing website
, as well as the general
Google
Privacy Policy as it applies to AdWords usage.
Disclose the use of cookies and identifiers
Disclose that you and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as Google advertising cookies) or other third-party identifiers together.
Do this through a Cookies Policy or at least a cookies clause in your Privacy Policy.
You need to let users know that you use third-parties for advertising and how these third-parties may use cookies.
If your business is based in the EU or you sell to EU customers,
there are additional requirements
you must meet in order to satisfy the EU Cookies Directive because all remarketing service are based on cookies usage.
Visitors to your website or mobile app must give informed, specific, and voluntary
consent to have cookies placed
on their devices before any cookies are placed.
Use our
Cookie Consent all-in-one solution
(Privacy Consent) for cookies management to comply with GDPR & CCPA/CPRA and other privacy laws:

Create your Cookie Consent banner today
to comply with GDPR, CCPA/CPRA and other privacy laws:
Start the Privacy Consent wizard
to create the Cookie Consent code by adding your website information.
At
Step 2
, add in information about your business.
At
Step 3
, select a plan for the Cookie Consent.
You're done! Your Cookie Consent Banner is ready
. Install the Cookie Consent banner on your website:
Display the Cookie Consent banner on your website by copy-paste the installation code in the
<head>
</head>
section of your website. Instructions how to add in the code for specific platforms (WordPress, Shopify, Wix and more) are available on the Install page.
The most common way
that this requirement is satisfied is through the use of pop-up banners that appear prominently on a web page the first time a user visits a website. The banner informs a user about the use of cookies and requires some sort of active action from the user to give consent.
In this example from the
BBC
, a user must click the "
Continue
" button before cookies can be used. The notification box clearly states that by clicking the "
Continue
" button, the user is consenting to BBC's use of cookies:
How visitors can opt out
How visitors can opt out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features you use, including through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI's consumer opt-out).
Google has its own available opt-out tool for Google Analytics that they encourage you to linking to, as noted earlier in this article. Linking to it is a great way to satisfy the requirement that users must be informed on how to opt-out.
If you're developing a mobile app and not a website, your Privacy Policy should be accessible from within the app.
Dropbox
accomplishes this by putting a "
Legal and Privacy
" section in its "
Settings
" tab that links to its Privacy Policy.
Here's an example from
The Sierra Trading Post's
Privacy Policy that discloses its use of the Google Analytics features:
If you have enabled the Advertising Features in your Google Analytics account,
update your Privacy Policy
by adding a new clause titled "
Interest-Based Online Advertising and Google Analytics
" or something similar, and make sure it includes the required information about your usage of these features.
