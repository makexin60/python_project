How do we Use your Data?
In most cases, we collect your information on the basis of your desire to avail a particular service from us or to complete a transaction using our platform. Therefore, our processing in many cases occurs on the basis of your consent or the need to perform a contract that we may have with you (also on behalf of your end users). However, in addition to collection on the basis of consent, there are other bases on which we may collect or process your information.
How and Where do we Store your Data?
Your data is stored on servers within the European Union and the United States of America. In case the servers are located in the USA, they are always hosted at centers that comply with EU data export restrictions and fully comply with GDPR. Any information given to us shall be stored and managed with the greatest care, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. We will not sell, rent, or exchange such personally identifiable information to any other organization or entity. Notwithstanding the above, we may indeed disclose personal information if required to do so by subpoenas, court orders or legal process or when such disclosure is made for establishment or exercise of legal rights or in defending against legal claim, or as otherwise required by law.
Data Retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you. You have the right to request that we delete personal data held on you. This does not apply if we have a legal reason for retaining it.
