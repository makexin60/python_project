3.2 Content Delivery Network
This website uses content delivery networks (CDN) to increase the security and delivery speed of the website.

For this purpose, personal data, including your IP address, may be processed by the provider of the content delivery networks. The providers of the content delivers networks act as data processors for the website provider.
Since a CDN represents a network of servers distributed worldwide, the use of a CDN may result in the transfer of personal data to a third country without an adequate level of data protection. In this case, it is ensured that appropriate safeguards are provided for the transfer in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR.
The legal basis for this data processing is the website providers legitimate interest in increasing the security and the delivery speed of the website pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR.

Abbreviated/anonymized IP address of the user's calling system
Your full IP address is deleted immediately in the course of anonymization.
The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our overriding legitimate interest are the above-mentioned purposes.

5. ADSENSE FOR DOMAINS
This website may use Google AdSense for Domains. Google AdSense for Domains is an online service that enables the provisioning of the advertising content of this website. Google AdSense for Domains is provided by Google Ireland Limited in Ireland ("Google").
When you visit this website, a request is sent to Google and Google processes the domain name and the IP address of the website visitor to dynamically return the advertising content of the website.  Google AdSense for Domains sets a cookie.

The advertising content is not personalized, and no profile of the website visitor is generated.
You can prevent the setting of cookies by Google AdSense for Domains by setting your browser accordingly, in particular by suppressing cookies from third-party providers, and thus prevent cookies from being set.
Further information about the purpose and scope of the data processing in the context of Google  AdSense for Domains is provided here:
https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
The use of Google AdSense for Domains may involve the transfer of personal data to a third country without an adequate level of data protection. In this case, it is ensured that appropriate safeguards are provided for the transfer in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR.

7. RECIPIENTS OF DATA
Personal data will only be passed on to third parties within the framework of legal requirements.

Appropriate technical and organizational measures are taken in accordance with the state of the art to ensure a level of protection for the personal data processed that is appropriate to the risk of the respective processing and to protect the data processed against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or against access by unauthorized persons. A restrictive rights and roles concept on a "need to know" basis ensures that employees only have access to the personal data they absolutely need to perform their duties.
The principles of data avoidance and data economy are strictly adhered to and personal data is only stored for as long as is necessary to achieve the respective purpose of the data processing purposes or as stipulated by the storage periods provided by law. If the purpose of storage no longer applies or if a storage period provided for by law expires, the personal data will be routinely anonymized or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.
11. AMENDMENT OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time so that it always complies with current legal requirements or in order to implement technical changes to the website and/or additional services implemented on the website.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect peopleâs privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Googleâs advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Googleâs advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page youâre visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partnersâ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information â for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data thatâs created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you donât want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
