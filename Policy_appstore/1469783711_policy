Lockdown Privacy Policy
Last Updated February 23rd, 2023
Lockdown has a privacy policy for its firewall and a privacy policy for its VPN, depending on which product(s) you're using. Unlike other Privacy Policies, Lockdown's Privacy Policies are
proven
, rather than blind-faith assertions.
Lockdown Firewall Privacy Policy
Lockdown VPN Privacy Policy
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at
team@lockdownprivacy.com
and we will respond as soon as possible.
Lockdown Firewall Privacy Policy
Everything Lockdown Firewall does stays on your device, and what you see is literally what you get, and nothing more or less, because that's the way it should be.
Longer Version: Everything Lockdown Firewall does stays on your phone, so no data is transmitted to any of our servers. This can be confirmed by checking the
source code
, which is 100% open and public for anyone to examine. Lockdown Firewall doesn't use any type of third party analytics, trackers, or APIs, so there's no risk of your data leaking to third parties. This means there's no Google Analytics, no Facebook Pixel, no Mixpanel, Fabric, Mailchimp, etc — nada.
Information We Collect
Lockdown Firewall collects nothing. It all stays on your device.
Lockdown VPN Privacy Policy
Lockdown VPN is powered by our Confirmed VPN, the Openly Operated and fully audited VPN that proves its no-log, no-tracking policies.
Confirmed VPN is certified as Openly Operated, so it is able to provide proof of the privacy claims in this Privacy Policy by using references from its
OpenAudit
. Learn more about the
Openly Operated Certification
, and read Confirmed VPN's full
Privacy Policy

"Knowing how much I'm being tracked every day on my phone is
            certainly an incentive to use this app. I care about my privacy, and you should too."

Meet Lockdown, The App That Reveals Who’s Tracking You On Your
              iPhone
Comprehensive Privacy Protection
Lockdown has two privacy features:
Firewall
and
Secure Tunnel VPN
. Each feature protects you from different threats, creating the complete
          solution for protecting your personal data, browsing history, and sensitive connections.
Firewall
Blocks Hidden Trackers
The world's first on-device, open source blocker that stops ads, trackers, and badware in all your
              apps.

Secure Tunnel VPN
Stops Browsing History Tracking
The no-logs, blazing-fast, privacy-first VPN. The only VPN to
prove
its Privacy Policy
              and be fully audited.

Transparency You Can Trust
There are many examples of privacy products that end up harming their users' privacy, and it's becoming more
          common over time. For example, a "privacy" app was found to be
spying on its users to mine personal data
, another was
stealing bandwidth for botnets
, and one was
injecting ads into
            browsing
. Even the biggest "brand" name in privacy (who, ironically, buys millions of dollars in ads
          that track users), was
hacked multiple times
and tried to cover it up for a year and a half.
The problem is lack of transparency. Who owns these companies? What happens to your data when you send it to
          them? Are they even based in a country that has any kind of consumer protection laws? And how do you
          ultimately know if they're telling the truth about anything?
To fix this problem, we created a certification called
Openly
            Operated
that ensures every aspect of a product is 100% transparent, including code, infrastructure,
          privacy or security claims, and even company location and owners. All claims and information must also be
          backed by public proof that anyone can check, and verified by independent auditors. In short, Openly Operated
          is the gold standard for transparency and trust in apps.
Lockdown's Firewall and Secure Tunnel are both Openly Operated. They're built from the ground up to provide
          full clarity into exactly what it does with user data, and more importantly, what it doesn't do with user
          data. You won't see transparency like this in most other privacy products.

About
Block Trackers
Request
What are trackers?
Trackers hide inside the apps you use every day, and send your data to third parties.
Why are trackers bad?
Privacy
: Personal data shouldn't be shared with third parties, especially without user consent.
Stability
: Trackers can crash apps, and recently caused a
massive outage
for millions of users.
Performance
: Trackers operate even in the background, causing battery drain and slowness.
Privacy Review exposes trackers in popular apps by using
Lockdown
, an app that blocks trackers.
Rating System
The final rating of apps is based on the following criteria:
Trackers
: How invasive are the trackers? How frequently do they send data? Do users have a chance to consent or opt-out of tracking?
Popularity
: Popular apps are held to a higher standard, because there are simply more people affected by hidden tracking. More users, more responsibility.
Red Flags
: Does the app engage in any suspicious behavior, or have a lax or vague Privacy Policy, or have an irresponsible track record with privacy or security?
An "A" rating is exceptional, "B" is decent, "C" is not good, "D" is bad, and "F" is failing.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated Feburary 23rd, 2023
Confirmed VPN is certified as Openly Operated, so it is able to provide proof of the privacy claims in this Privacy Policy by using references from its
Audit Kit
. Learn more about the
Openly Operated Certification
.
Confirmed Technologies, LLC. (also “Confirmed”, “the company”, “we”, and “us”) collects the minimum data possible to ensure your data and privacy is protected.
Confirmed complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for all users, regardless of location. In addition, we collect the minimum personal information required to provide the Confirmed service.
We do not sell or provide data to advertising services, and there are zero third party frameworks for marketing or re-marketing purposes. This includes any direct or indirect advertising frameworks by Facebook, Twitter, and Google, including Crashlytics, Fabric, Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, Firebase, and Twitter SDK.
Although this Privacy Policy is a legal document that Confirmed is required to follow, we also prove that Confirmed’s operations and services conform to this Privacy Policy by engaging independent 3rd parties to audit us. The materials provided to auditors are also available publicly as an
"Audit Kit"
.
Information We Collect
Information From Website Browsers
If you are just browsing the Confirmed website, we do not store or log your IP address or use a cookie to track you.
Personal Information From Users With Accounts
If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation.
For all users, we record the creation date of the account and the active subscription plan for the account. While using the Confirmed service, we record the total amount of bandwidth consumed in the last thirty days. No website data or traffic is stored related to this metric. This bandwidth data is used only to throttle very high-bandwidth users and provide a fair distribution of resources to all users.
For mobile users, we require an App Store or Google Play receipt, which contains no personally identifying information. The sole purpose of this data is to to validate that the account has an active subscription for the Confirmed service.
For desktop users, we require a valid credit card that is processed and stored by Stripe, Inc., a PCI-compliant payment processor. We do not store your credit card number on our servers, nor can we access it. Stripe also will also store metadata related to your financial transaction that we can access, such as zip code and country of origin, primarily to validate the authenticity of the transaction and pay applicable local taxes (i.e., Value Added Tax in the European Union).
A valid e-mail address is not required for the Confirmed service, but strongly recommended. It provides a means of communication for changes to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, as well as a communication channel for all data access. We record an encrypted form of your email address, which we cannot decrypt because we do not have direct, unaudited access to the encryption keys, nor do we have direct, unaudited access to the database where this encrypted email resides. We also record a hashed form of your email address, which we also do not have direct, unaudited access to.
Referral Program
If you participate in our voluntary referral program, the Confirmed service will record each account that signed up with your referral code in your account data. This is solely to attribute active subscribers to your account and provide the applicable discount to your subscription plan.If you refer someone (or you were referred by someone), the referrer will receive an e-mail upon the referred user signing up for a trial as well as upon becoming a paid subscriber. The referrer always will be able to see whether you have an active subscription because it affects the pricing of their account.
Website Traffic
We do not log or track any usage of our website, except for error messages on our server (such as accessing a page that does not exist). For these cases, we log the error (i.e., the URL attempted) and the time that it happened, but no personally identifying information such as a user’s IP address is logged.
VPN Traffic
Not logging user traffic and being able to prove this is a standout feature for Confirmed VPN. The following summarizes our proof (rather than blind assertions made by other VPN services), and we encourage you to read the entire detailed proof in our independently conducted
Audit Reports
as well as explore the actual VPN's source code and open infrastructure in the
Audit Kit
, which provides full transparency in everything in Confirmed VPN's operations.
If you have any questions or feedback, we're
always available
via email, Telegram, and other contact methods.
For traffic and data through our VPN, we do not log or store any website or traffic data for any period of time, with the exception of violations of Confirmed's anti-abuse rules, which are fully public and designed to prevent malicious VPN users from abusing other VPN users. Without these restrictions, malicious users could significantly deteriorate the quality of other users' internet connections. Every VPN has anti-abuse measures, but only Confirmed is able to prove exactly what these measures are.
The anti-abuse rules are based on the public and industry-standard
Emerging Threats
ruleset, with our services' specific customizations publicly available
here
. To access a specific rule file, simply append the file name that's listed to the same url — for example, the direct link to access the confirmed.rules file is
here
.
The anti-abuse rule triggers are performed algorithmically and no individual has access to or processes any data. Even in the case that an anti-abuse rule is triggered, the user's real IP address is not logged. The anti-abuse measures above are also described in the Acceptable Use provisions of Confirmed's
Terms of Service
.
Privacy Practices
We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
However, Confirmed understands that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries.
We provide the same standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Policy — to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide.
Openly Operated Principles
Data transmitted by Openly Operated is at the minimum encrypted using HTTPS and SSL/TLS. The limited data we collect on our servers is encrypted with a key that we cannot access without automatically sending the user an alert that we are accessing this data. By being an Openly Operated product, our architecture is open source and available for public audit to prove that we cannot access any personal data. For proof of these claims, see our Audit Kit's
Open Infrastructure
and
Open Source
sections.
In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of the breach and notify any affected users without undue delay.
Compelled Disclosure
Confirmed may be legally required to disclose information to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.
      In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Confirmed strives for transparency and protection of user data. We will notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.
Right to Erasure
Confirmed will retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
If you would like to delete the encrypted version of your account information, you may do so by
contacting us
. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full account within 90 days of your request. To see proof of how your data is stored and deleted, see the
Open Source
section of the Confirmed VPN Audit Kit.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@confirmedvpn.com and we will respond as quickly as we can.
