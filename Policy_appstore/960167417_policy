WordBoard Keyboard Privacy
We know you are putting a lot of trust in us being your keyboard, so we take your privacy very seriously.
When you install our (or any keyboard) iOS shows you a scarey message saying : "full access allows the developer to transmit anything you type, including things you have previously typed with this keyboard. This could include sensitive information such as your credit card number or street address.".
Our promise to you:
We will not collect your keystrokes or send them to a server.
We will not access your passwords, credit cards or other sensitive information.
What we do collect:
Anonymous usage statistics (how many people are using the app etc) to make the app better.
Anonymous crash reports to make the app more stable.
