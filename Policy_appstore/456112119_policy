User Information.
When you use the Website, we may automatically receive and record information from your browser, including without limitation information and statistics about your online/offline status, your IP address, internet service provider, search history, type of browser, your regional and language settings and software and hardware attributes. Our systems may automatically record and store technical information regarding the method and nature of your use of the Website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your browser on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. Engage uses such PII in order to understand the usage trends of our Website and improve it.
Aggregate and Analytical Data.
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve potential customers of the Services, we often use log files to conduct research on information and statistics about online/offline status, IP address, internet service provider (ISP), date and time stamps and number of clicks on page, cookie information, device ID, and your settings. We also combine and share such information and other information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) with third party advertising partners. These advertising partners will use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third party websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising”. We allow access to other data collected by the services to share information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer not to share your PII with third party advertising partners, you may let us know. We reserve the right to remove or add new analytic tools.

We may also use persistent cookies that remain on your browser until it is closed, in order to manage and maintain the Website and record your use of the Website. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to and stored on your browser. Cookies do not damage your browser. Most browsers may allow you to block cookies but you may not be able to use some features on the Website if you block them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie (this enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not). We may also use web beacons via the Website to collect information. Web beacons or “gifs”, are electronic images that may be used in our Website or in our emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

Links.
to other services, sites and applications may be provided by Engage as a convenience to our users. Engage is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other sites and applications and you visit them at your own risk. This Privacy Policy applies solely to PII collected by us.
Children.
If you are a child under the age of 18, you must obtain parental consent prior to using our Website. Engage will not knowingly contact or engage with children under the age of 18 without said parental consent. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided us with their PII, please contact us at the address given above and we will endeavor to delete that PII from our databases.
Information Sharing
. As part of providing the Website our affiliates, agents and representatives may have access to your PII. We require these parties to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and subject to security and other appropriate confidentiality safeguards. Engage may also share PII in the following circumstances: (a) as required for the provision, maintenance and improvement of the Website, including with our service providers providing hosting and storage services (e.g. AWS – multi region and MongoDB Atlas); (b) if we become involved in a reorganization, merger, consolidation, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, with any type of entity, whether public, private, foreign or local; and/or (c) to satisfy applicable law or prevention of fraud or harm or to enforce applicable agreements and/or their terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof. Where we transfer PII of data subjects pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR outside of EU/EEA (for example to third parties who provide us with services), we will generally obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your PII. Engage transfers such PII only pursuant to an Adequacy Decisions as adopted by European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), or by relying on the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission.
Information Security
. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of PII. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We retain your PII only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
Data Integrity.
Engage processes PII only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service agreements. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the PII needed to provide or improve our Website. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the PII we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their PII whenever necessary. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is interpreted as an obligation to store information, and we may, at our own discretion, delete or avoid from recording and storing any and all information.
Your Rights
.
Right of Access and Rectification
. You have the right to know what PII we collect about you and to ensure that such data is accurate and relevant for the purposes for which we collected it. We allow our users the option to access and obtain a copy of their PII and to rectify such PII if it is not accurate, complete or updated. However we may first ask you to provide us certain credentials to permit us to identify your PII.
Right to Delete PII or Restrict Processing
. You have the right to delete your PII or restrict its processing. We may postpone or deny your request if your PII is in current use for the purposes for which it was collected or for other legitimate purposes such as compliance with legal obligations.

. You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your PII. Exercising this right will not affect the lawfulness of processing your PII based on your consent before its withdrawal.

You may exercise the above rights by sending a request to
privacy@engage.com

Enforcement.

Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our treatment of PII by contacting us as provided above. When we receive formal written complaints it is Engage’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns.
