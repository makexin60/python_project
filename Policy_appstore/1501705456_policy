Privatlivspolitik (DANSK)
Denne applikation (”My Business by OrderYOYO”) leveres af OrderYOYO som en service til OrderYOYO’s restaurant partnere. Herved får OrderYOYO’s restaurant partnere adgang til deres kommercielle data og performance ved brug af OrderYOYO’s øvrige tjenester. Applikationen leveres af OrderYOYO uden yderligere omkostninger udover de allerede aftalte kommercielle betalinger, der er aftalt mellem OrderYOYO og dennes restaurant partnere. Eventuelle vilkår, der ikke er defineret i denne privatlivspolitik, er defineret i vores restaurant partneraftaler.
Denne privatlivspolitik har til formål at oplyse OrderYOYO’s restaurantpartnere om vores generelle politikker for indsamling, brug og videregivelse af oplysninger, når du bruger tjenesterne i My Business by OrderYOYO.
Ved at bruge My Business by OrderYOYO, accepterer du indsamling og brug af oplysninger i henhold til denne politik. De oplysninger, vi indsamler, bruges til at levere og forbedre My Business by OrderYOYO. Vi vil ikke bruge eller dele disse oplysninger med nogen — undtagen som beskrevet i denne privatlivspolitik.
Indsamling af oplysninger
Når du tilgår My Business by OrderYOYO, deler du identificerbare oplysninger med os ved at logge ind med dit Restaurant-Id og Printer-Id, som leveres separat fra denne tjeneste ved indgåelsen af en restaurant partneraftale med OrderYOYO.
Oplysninger, vi indsamler automatisk:
My Business by OrderYOYO bruger en tredjepartstjeneste, der kan indsamle oplysninger, som anvendes til at fastlægge din brug af applikationen. Et link til privatlivspolitikken for de tredjeparts-tjenesteudbydere, applikationen bruger, kan findes her: Google Analytics for Firebase.
Udover den førnævnte tredjepartstjeneste anvendes følgende tjenester til automatisk indsamling af brugsoplysninger:
• Access Network State — gør det muligt for applikationen at tilgå oplysninger om netværk;
• Get Accounts — giver adgang til brugerkonti, der er gemt på din enhed. Dette hjælper os med at tilbyde muligheder for godkendelse i denne applikation;
• Manage Accounts — tillader applikationen at foretage handlinger såsom at tilføje og fjerne konti samt slette disses adgangskoder;
• Use Credentials — gør det muligt for applikationen at hente et token, selv i tilfælde hvor det ikke er tilgængeligt i cachen;
• Internet — giver applikationen adgang til internettet.
Logdata
I tilfælde af fejl ved anvendelse af din brug af My Business by OrderYOYO, indsamler vi data og oplysninger (via tredjepartsprodukter) om din telefon kaldet ”logdata”. Disse logdata kan indeholde oplysninger såsom din enheds internetprotokol-adresse (”IP”-adresse), enhedens navn, operativsystemets version, konfigurationen af My Business by OrderYOYO, tid og dato for din anvendelse samt andre statistikker.
Cookies
Cookies er filer med en lille mængde data, der er almindeligt anvendt som anonyme, entydige identifikatorer. Disse sendes til din browser fra de hjemmesider, du besøger, og gemmes på enhedens interne hukommelse.
My Business by OrderYOYO bruger ikke eksplicit disse cookies. Dog kan applikationen bruge kode og biblioteker fra tredjeparter, der anvender cookies til at indsamle oplysninger og forbedre deres tjenester. Du har mulighed for enten at acceptere eller afvise disse cookies og få at vide, hvornår en cookie bliver sendt til din enhed. Hvis du vælger at afvise vores cookies, vil dele af My Business by OrderYOYO kunne være uanvendelige.
Sikkerhed
Vi værdsætter den tillid, du viser os ved at give os dine legitimationsoplysninger, som det beskrives i afsnittet ”Indsamling og brug”. Vi stræber efter at beskytte disse på forretningsmæssigt rimelige måder.
Links til andre hjemmesider
My Business by OrderYOYO kan indeholde links til andre hjemmesider. Hvis du klikker på et tredjepartslink, vil du blive dirigeret til den pågældende hjemmeside. Bemærk, at disse eksterne hjemmesider ikke altid drives af OrderYOYO. Derfor råder vi dig på det kraftigste til at gennemgå privatlivspolitikken for sådanne sider. Vi har ingen kontrol over, og påtager os dermed ikke ansvar for indhold tilhørende tredjeparter.
Ændringer i denne fortrolighedspolitik
Vi opdaterer denne privatlivspolitik fra tid til anden. Derfor rådes du til at gennemgå denne side med jævne mellemrum for at se eventuelle ændringer. Vi vil underrette dig om eventuelle ændringer ved at offentliggøre den nye privatlivspolitik på denne side. Sådanne ændringer træder i kraft, umiddelbart efter at de er lagt ud på denne side.
