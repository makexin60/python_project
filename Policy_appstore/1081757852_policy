SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: [1st February 2024]
This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Samsung devices and services, from mobile phones, tablets, TVs and home appliances, to the customer services and online services we provide. We will refer to these devices and services as the “Services” in this policy.
It is important that you check back often for updates to the Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices with respect to the Services or changes in applicable law. We will post a notice on our website or on your device to notify you in advance of material changes to our Privacy Policy and indicate at the top of the Privacy Policy when it was most recently updated. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will always be available here:
https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy
. In addition to this Privacy Policy, Samsung also provides specific privacy notices related to certain products and services. In the event of any deviation between the terms of this Privacy Policy and a specific privacy notice, the terms of the specific privacy notice shall prevail.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Samsung Electronics collects information from you in a variety of ways.
Information You Provide Directly
Some Services enable you to provide us information directly. For example:
o When you create an account or profile with us, we ask for information such as your name, date of birth, or contact information such as phone number and email address.
o If you order a product or paid service from us, we ask for your name, address, contact information, and shipping and payment information to process your order. You can also choose to save your payment information with us so you can check out more easily next time.
o To provide responses when you contact Customer Service, we ask for certain information to verify your identity and the product you are inquiring about.
o When you communicate with our Customer Service staff or others, your communications will be transmitted through our systems.
o If you share your contacts, we will collect their phone numbers and other contact information to facilitate file sharing and messaging. You can turn off or restrict these features in the Settings on your devices.
Information About Your Use of Services
In addition to the information you provide, we collect information about your use of our Services through software on your devices and by other means. This information includes:

We sometimes gather publicly or commercially available information, including information from social networks you use, and combine this with other information about you so that we can better understand your needs, interests, and preferences.
Other Information We Collect
We also collect other information about you, your devices, or your use of Services that you consent to send us. We obtain your consent in accordance with applicable law.
Third Party Analytics
Through certain Services, we collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services. We use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyse your use of the Services and to improve the Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services, help administer the Services, and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit
http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html
and
https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
.
Your Options
You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as information requested as part of purchasing a product or service. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use some Services. We will do our best to explain these limitations when we ask for your information so that you can make an informed decision.

We will only send you personalised advertising, promotions, and offers when you have provided your consent to receive marketing communications from Samsung.
o To provide promotions and offers by way of direct marketing communications (such as via email, push, or text messages), only where you have given us your separate consent.
o To operate, evaluate, and improve our business, including developing and improving new and existing products and services, managing and improving our communications, analysing our Services and customer base (including conducting market research, asking for your opinions on our products and services, and carrying out customer surveys, with your separate consent if required) and aggregating and anonymising data.

o To comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, and our policies, including the Samsung Privacy Policy.
o To analyse a defective device that is returned to Samsung. Samsung takes measures to ensure that all defective devices are wiped of personal data before such devices are analysed.
We use and combine the information we collect about you from our Services, devices, or other sources to provide you with a better experience. For example, you can save payment information you used to make a purchase on our website so that you can check out faster next time you make a purchase. We also use the information you provide directly or through other sources as described above to provide content you may like or that you have personalised.
You can make choices about your information. Check out the
WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?
section to learn more.
Non-targeted Ads
Please note that your privacy choice with respect to interest-based or personalised ads (“targeted ads”) will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with generic, basic, or contextual types of ads (“non-targeted ads”) that are not specifically based on the information we describe to you to provide targeted ads for a particular Service.
For mobile devices, the information we use to show you non-targeted ads includes the applicable app information (e.g. app package, version, name, and domain), device information (e.g. device type, manufacturer, operating system, version, display information, telecommunications provider, country, and language), and device identifiers (e.g. IP and advertising ID). We share this data with trusted business partners (data controllers) and trusted service providers (processors) to provide you with non-targeted ads, subject to appropriate contractual safeguards being in place.
Samsung processes this limited data on the basis of its legitimate interest to serve non-targeted ads. These ads might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.
[For European Economic Area (EEA) Residents only]
Samsung processes personal information for the purposes described above. Samsung’s legal basis to process personal information includes processing:
(i) So that we can keep our promises to you (performance of contract, GDPR Article 6(1)(b)), such as providing you with a Service.
(ii) To promote our business interests (legitimate interest, GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) (for example, to manage our relationship with you, improve your customer service experience, and provide generic ads), including communications on our website, third party websites, and online platforms.
(iii) To comply with the law and legal processes (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)).
(iv) With your consent (GDPR Article 6(1)(a) (and Article 9 in the case of special categories of data), for example, to send direct marketing communications. When we ask for your consent, we will give you information about what information we are using, and how you can revoke your consent. Alternatively, to revoke your consent, you can contact us as specified in the
CONTACT US
section of this Privacy Policy.
Samsung Electronics is the data controller of your personal information as described above. For some direct marketing communications and some personalised advertising in Europe, Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited, which is located in the United Kingdom, is also the data controller of your personal information. Some of our European Samsung subsidiaries also process your personal information. In some situations, they will act as a data controller, including for customer services and some marketing activities. Where the European Samsung subsidiary is a data controller, you can refer to its own local Privacy Policy on its website to understand how it processes your personal information.
WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?
We disclose your information internally within our business, as well as to the following entities, for the purposes described above.
o
Affiliates
: Other Samsung Electronics Group companies which we control or own.
o
Business Partners
: Partners who we work together with. For example, we may work with a bank so that you can use one of our Services to make faster and more efficient payments. These business partners control and manage your personal information.
o
Service Providers
: Carefully selected companies that provide services for or on behalf of us, such as companies that help us with repairs, customer contact centres, customer care activities, advertising (including personalised advertising on our websites, third-party websites, online platforms, and social media platforms), conducting customer satisfaction surveys, billing, or that send emails on our behalf. These providers are also committed to protecting your information.
o
Other Parties When Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Services
: For example, it may be necessary by law, legal process, or court order from governmental authorities to disclose your information. They may also seek your information from us for the purposes of law enforcement, national security, anti-terrorism, or other issues that are related to public security.
o
Other Parties in Connection with Corporate Transactions
: We may disclose your information to a third party as part of a merger or transfer, acquisition or sale, or in the event of a bankruptcy.
o
Other Parties with Your Consent or at Your Direction
: In addition to the disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we share information about you with third parties when you separately consent to or request such sharing.
HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?
We take data protection seriously. We have put in place physical and technical safeguards to keep the information we collect secure. However, please note that although we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure.
WHERE DO WE SEND YOUR DATA?
Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information within and outside of your country of residence, consistent with this policy. In particular, your personal information will be transferred to the Republic of Korea.
In addition, your use of the Services may also involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries where necessary; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, China, Singapore, Vietnam, India, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, and Japan. Some countries have been determined by the European Commission to adequately protect your personal data. You can find a list of those countries here:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en
. Please note that the data protection laws and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. We will take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information remains protected. Such measures include the use of Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the transfer of data outside of the EEA and the United Kingdom. To request more information or to obtain a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses, contact us. See the
CONTACT US
section.
WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?
Your personal information belongs to you. In accordance with applicable law, you have the right to ask us to provide details about what we have collected, and you can ask us to delete it or correct any inaccuracies. You can also ask us to restrict or limit processing, sharing, or transfer of your personal information, as well as to provide to you your personal information that we have collected so you can use it for your own purposes. You have the right to data portability, which means you can ask us to provide your personal information to you or to a third party in a machine-readable format. You can also object to your personal information being processed and can withdraw your consent. However, requesting the deletion of your personal information may also result in a loss of access to Services we provide. We will not delete data that we are required by law to retain.
You also have the right to object to processing on the basis of legitimate interests, and to object to processing for marketing purposes, including profiling.
To make a request concerning your rights or to make an inquiry, contact us. See the
CONTACT US
section.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
We will not keep your personal information for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. This means that information will be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no longer required.
We take appropriate steps to ensure that we process and retain information about you based on the following logic:
1. At least the duration for which the information is used to provide you with a service;
2. As required under law, a contract, or with regard to our statutory obligations;
3. Only for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, is processed, or for longer if required under any contract, by applicable law, or for statistical purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards.
WHAT THIRD-PARTY SERVICES DO WE USE?
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality in our Services is provided by third parties. These third parties may use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of these Services. These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check their privacy policies to understand how they use your data.
For some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services.
COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
We, along with certain third parties such as content providers and advertisers, may also use technologies called cookies, beacons, or pixels, as well as other tools (collectively known as “technologies”) that communicate information from your device to a server. These technologies can be embedded in online content, videos, and advertisements. They allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular advertisement, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the content as well as information about your device, including the IP address of your device. We, and third parties, use these technologies for purposes such as verifying that content and ads have been delivered and viewed correctly.
Cookies
Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other devices. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognise you across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:
• Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter them each time you log on to a service.
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. Studying this information helps us to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so you do not get the same ad each time you access a Service.
• Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.
We use the following types of cookies across our Services:
Essential cookies
: Enable you to receive the services you request via our website. Without these cookies, Services that you have asked for cannot be provided. For example, essential cookies may be used to authenticate you when you log-in. These cookies are automatically enabled and cannot be turned off because they are essential to enable our Services to work effectively.
Performance cookies
: Enable us to analyse the performance and design of our Services and detect errors. For example, this type of cookie enables us to recognise that you have used a service before, and shows us which of our apps are most popular by allowing us to see which pages visitors access most frequently and how much time visitors spend on each app. We use Google Analytics, Adobe, and similar analytics cookies to achieve this.
This type of cookie is automatically disabled and can be configured to your particular preferences.
Functionality and profile cookies
: Allow us to deliver a better user experience. For example, this type of cookie ensures that the information displayed on your next visit to our website will match up with your user preferences or your Samsung account from which you linked to a Service. This type of cookie is automatically disabled and can be configured to your particular preferences.
Advertising / targeting cookies
: Enable us and our carefully selected partners to personalise our website, deliver advertisements to you, or contact you directly where you have separately consented to such communications, in a way which is relevant to you and which matches your interests by, for example, using information about Services you have accessed through our apps. We may use and combine your cookie data with the information we collect about you from other sources to provide you with a better experience. For example to provide you with more relevant direct marketing, but only where you have consented to receive direct marketing.
We may allow carefully selected third parties to place this type of cookie or similar technologies for this purpose. For example, and without limitation, we use Google remarketing tags to allow our retail partners to advertise products which you have browsed on our website. You can learn more about how Google remarketing tags work here:
https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/
. In addition, third parties such as Facebook may place cookies to track you across applicable websites and across other websites.
We may also work with carefully selected business partners to deliver advertising jointly. This may involve combining cookie data collected from our website with data collected by our business partner. Depending on which cookies you enable, we may also use information collected to understand our customers’ preferences and to influence future advertising campaigns including how we select who we direct our marketing to.
We, and our carefully selected business partners, may place cookies when we show ads for our products or services on third-party websites and when you click on those ads, so we know which sites and ads our customers have seen and which ads have been interacted with. We and our business partners only use these cookies if you give your consent to the operator of the third-party site. You can adjust your preferences in relation to these cookies on those third-party sites. We will use this type of cookie for a period of 13 months.
Third party cookies
: Our Services may also display content from a third party website or service, which may result in cookies from third parties being stored on your device. You can manage your preferences for these third parties in the same way as for Samsung cookies. Please see below for more details on how to manage your preferences. We do not control the storage and use of these cookies by these third parties, and you should refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third parties for more information. For more information on other service providers, please contact us by visiting our Privacy Support Page at
https://www.samsung.com/request-desk
. This type of cookie is automatically disabled and can be configured to your particular preferences.
Beacons and Pixels
We, along with certain third parties, use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, ads, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, and determine the time and date on which you viewed relevant content as well as the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyse the use of our Services and, along with other information, to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
Other Local Storage
We, along with certain third parties, use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above. They are stored on your devices and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, visit
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html
.
Cookies are retained for no longer than necessary to provide the function for which they are used. This will vary depending on the specific Service. For example, a cookie to authenticate log-in may be kept for a longer period of time than a cookie used to allow you to place items in a shopping basket as a guest on our website.
How to manage your preferences
Where we use these technologies on our Services, you can withdraw your consent or manage your preferences at any time. However, some technologies are essential or necessary to run the Service and cannot be changed. Visit the settings or cookie preference menu on the relevant Services or on your device for more information on how to manage these options.
