The right to withdraw consent
allows you to withdraw any previously granted consent to the processing of personal data. In this case, we will not further process your personal data for this purpose. In some cases, you can revoke consent by changing the settings in an application or on a website. However, the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing of personal data until the moment of its withdrawal.
·
The right of access to personal data
entitles you, upon your request, to obtain information whether we process your personal data and, if so, to what extent. You also have the right to request a copy of the processed personal data. If you submit a request, we are also obliged to inform you of the purpose of the processing, the recipient of the processed personal data or other related information.
·
The right of correction
, for example, shall allow you to ask us to change any of your personal data we process if there has been any change to it (e.g. change of surname, address change, etc.).
·
The right of erasure
is also referred to as the "right to be forgotten" and obliges us as a personal data controller to erase your personal information in the following cases:
o   the purpose of the processing no longer exists (e.g. termination of the contractual relationship) and we have no other legitimate purpose to process your data,
o   you revoke your consent to the processing of personal data and there is no other reason for processing your personal data (e.g. withdrawing your marketing consent, provided that you do not have a contractual relationship with us),
o   you object to the processing of personal data (provided that the objection is justified and there is no legal reason for processing your personal data),
o   in accordance with applicable legislation, we are required to delete your data.
·
The right to a restriction on the processing of personal data
represents the possibility for the data subject to request a restriction on the processing of all or some of his personal data for a certain period in specific cases specified by the legislation in force. This is the case, for example, where the data subject denies the accuracy of his personal data and this issue needs to be examined.
·
The right of objection
applies when personal data is processed based on a legitimate interest (e.g. to protect our property). You can also object if your personal data will be processed for direct marketing purposes. In justified cases, the processing of your personal data will be stopped after the objection is accepted.
·
The right to transfer personal data
- when you ask us to transfer your personal data to another controller, it is our responsibility to provide and transfer this data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This right can only be exercised if the processing is based on consent or contract and at the same time it is automated processing.
·

6.   RULES ON SHARING YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES
We divide the rules according to which we share your personal data with our processors into two basic categories.
The first category involves sharing personal data within the European Union and the European Economic Area, the second category involves sharing to third countries outside the European Union and the European Economic Area and sharing with international organizations.
In order to share your personal data with a processor within the European Union and the European Economic Area, we ensure that:
·       personal information shall be shared for a specific purpose (such as fulfilling an order for services ordered through the Citymove platform)
·       the transfer consists only of a clearly defined and necessary scope of personal data,
·       the transfer shall be performed based on a duly concluded contract for the processing of personal data or such contractual clause,
·       sharing shall be done in an appropriate secure way (if technically possible encryption, pseudonymization, etc.).
Within the internal administrative functions, we cooperate with HoppyGo s.r.o., a Czech company, which, based on our authorization and the contract on the processing of personal data, provides mainly customer support services.
In the case of sharing your personal data with countries outside the European Union and the European Economic Area and with international organizations, we shall do so solely with entities located in countries, which, as decided by the European Commission, ensure adequate protection of personal data, conclude with us model agreement based on the standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission, or fall under another data transfer scheme permitted by the regulations.
If we decide to change the payment gateway operator, we will ensure the secure transfer of your Information about the payment method to the new operator's system so that you can continue to use the Citymove platform features without having to re-enter your payment details. This applies similarly to other services necessary for our operations.
In the event that we undergo a change and transfer our business or other activities, in whole or in part, to another person (including assignment of contracts), then such transfer would include personal data relating to those activities. For these purposes, information (including personal data) relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes.
Upon a lawful request, your personal data may be provided to public authorities, in particular courts, the Police of the Czech Republic and other law enforcement authorities to the extent necessary and within the limits of the law.
