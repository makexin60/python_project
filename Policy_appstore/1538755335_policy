Privacy Policy
This privacy disclaimer determines PeerBerry’s privacy policy regarding this website. PeerBerry website visitors’ personal data protection is provided in accordance with the existing laws and regulations of the Republic of Croatia and the General Data Protection Regulation, which applies across the European Union. In this document, “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to a company PEERBERRY d.o.o. and/or the PeerBerry platform.
1. Introduction
This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide us with. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, use, amend, deliver, disclose, delete, or otherwise act on information.
We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.
We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us. Except as set out below, we do not share, sell, or disclose to a third party any information collected through our website.
2. Type of information we collect and store
We collect information when you come directly to use PeerBerry services through our website. To provide a full range of services we will collect some or all of the following information:
Personal information for identification: name, surname, business name, date of birth;
Contact and communication information: address, email, phone number as well as recommendations, comments, requests, inquiries;
Transactional information: records of payments made to received from PEERBERRY d.o.o.;
Contractual information: applications and agreements concerning the use of our services;
Profile and usage data include login and password details and IP address. It also includes other data about how you use those services. Using cookies and other internet tracking software, we gather this data from devices you use to connect to those services, such as computers and mobile phones. Please refer to our Cookie policy for further details on what cookies are and how we use them.
3. The bases on which we process information about you
The controller of the processing of personal data is the website operator PEERBERRY d.o.o. The General Data Protection Regulation states that we are only allowed to use personal information if we have a genuine reason to do so.
PEERBERRY d.o.o. will only use your personal information for one of the following reasons:
–
To fulfill an agreement we have with you.
When you create an account on our website or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us. In order to carry out our obligations under that contract, we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information. We process this information on the basis of an agreement between us or your request for us to use the information before we enter into a legal contract.
–
When you consent to it.
Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you with more information about our business, including our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information. Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.  Sometimes, you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply. We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent, or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.
–
When it is in our legitimate interest.
Where we process your information on this basis, we do so after having considered:
whether the same objective could be achieved through other means;
whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm;
whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so;
for example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of: record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business;
responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response;
protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party;
insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business risk;
protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so.
–
When it is our legal duty.
We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must process your information to comply with a statutory obligation. For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they request it or if they have the proper authorization, such as a court order. This may include your personal information.
4. Specific use of information provided to us
Sending a message to our support team:
When you contact us, we collect the data you have given us to reply with the information you need. We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address, to track our communications with you and provide a high-quality service.
Complaining:
When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have provided. We will use that information to resolve your complaint.
We are also entitled to process personal data for other purposes if they are necessary for performing the obligations provided by the law or if such goals are justified for performing the agreements entered into with and/or between the users.
5. Transfer and disclosure of personal data
We are entitled to transfer personal data in accordance with the Terms of Use and the law, primarily to:
Persons to whom the portal operator is obliged to transfer the user’s personal data based on the signed agreements with the user and law;
Persons providing the accounting services to PEERBERRY d.o.o.;
Persons providing legal assistance in connection with agreements concluded with the users;
Persons providing collection of debts and other related services for collection of user contractual debts.
We are entitled to transfer your personal data to the third persons in any other case only when there is justified interest for ensuring the performance of the agreements signed with users and the transfer of information does not contradict the law.
6. Information Security and Third Parties
We are taking all necessary measures to ensure the security of personal data and avoid undue access by third parties, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
We encrypt the transmission of data to our websites using high-grade encryption and digital certificates. We constantly review and test our encryption and security measures to ensure they are appropriate;
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems;
We limit access to areas of our systems where personal information is stored to those of our employees who are in no need of that information to be able to carry out our day-to-day business activities. The people who access these areas are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.
Our website may contain links to other websites operated by third parties. PeerBerry is not responsible for personal information that others may collect, store, and use through their websites. This privacy policy applies only to personal information that is collected by PeerBerry.
In order to ensure information transmission within the world wide web environment, PeerBerry recommends that before starting the use of the website, the user makes sure that the information is kept secure when being online, the computer is equipped with working and up-to-date antivirus software, as well as that the computer’s operating system is equipped with the latest available safety improvements.
7. Disclosure and sharing of your information
Although we do not disclose your personal information to any third party (except as set out in this privacy policy), we sometimes receive data that is indirectly made up of your personal information from third parties whose services we use.
8. Access to your own information, marketing and account deletion
Access to personal information.
You may review personally identifiable information that we hold about you at any time by signing into your account on the PeerBerry website. You can change some of your personal information in your client’s profile Settings. You can also request to change other parts of your personal information by emailing

.
Marketing.
Without your explicit consent, we will never pass your personal details on to third parties for marketing purposes. Where you are an existing customer or have previously requested the use of our services, we may use your personal information to inform you about relevant services and offers. You can opt-out at any time by changing your contact preferences within the personal profile area. If you choose to unsubscribe, we will still provide you with statements, legal notices, and other important information, such as changes to your existing services to meet our legal and contractual obligations to you.
Account deletion.
Account removal can be requested in PeerBerry account Settings (account deletion requests sent by email or message are not processed, unfortunately). Note that PeerBerry as the main data controller is obliged under the AML laws to collect and store clients’ personal data for a 5 to 10-year period, depending on the type of data (for more details, please contact our Client Support).
9. Retention of Data
We will keep your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy policy unless we are required or permitted by law to retain that information for longer period.
We will keep your personal information for as long as you are a customer of PeerBerry.
After your relationship with PeerBerry ends, we may keep your data for up to 10 years as required for us to respond to any queries or complaints, to maintain records according to rules and regulations that apply to us, and to comply with other law, including for the period demanded by our tax authorities.
10. Other matters
If you are not happy with our Privacy policy or if you have any complaint, as well as any questions how we are using your personal information, please let us know by the email
info@peerberry.com
.
If you are in any way dissatisfied about how we process your personal information, you have a right to contact the data protection supervisory authority of Republic of Croatia.
Our Privacy policy has been compiled so as to comply with the law of every country or legal jurisdiction in which we aim to do business. If you think it fails to satisfy the law of your jurisdiction, we should like to hear from you.
