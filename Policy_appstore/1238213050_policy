Summary of ICONOMI Privacy Policy
ICONOMI respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. Here you can find a quick overview of ICONOMI Privacy Policy. In case you have any question, please do not hesitate and contact us at

. We collect personal data to provide you with our services. When we require certain personal data from users it is because such data is relevant for specified purposes. We may not be able to serve you as effectively or offer you all or any of our services when you choose not to share certain data with us. We collect different types of personal data such as Personal Identification Data, Formal Identification Data, Financial and Transaction Data, wherein ​we may process your personal data if you consent to the processing, to satisfy our legal obligations (e. g. AML regulations, tax regulations), if it is necessary to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we entered with you, or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you, or for our legitimate interests. ICONOMI understands how important your privacy is, which is why we maintain appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal data you entrust to us. We take care to allow your personal data to be accessed only by those who really need to in order to perform their tasks and duties and/or to meet legal and contractual obligations or for the purpose of processing of personal data on other legal basis. You are entitled to review, correct, or amend your personal data, or to delete that data where it is inaccurate. You are also entitled to object to processing, request restriction of processing, request the transfer of data or withdraw your consent at any time. We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes of our business relationship with you, to perform our contractual obligations to you, or if longer, as required for legal and regulatory purposes. ICONOMI Ltd., with its seat in the United Kingdom and ICONOMI d.o.o., with its seat in Slovenia qualify as joint controllers under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you believe that we have infringed your rights, we encourage you to contact us first at
