We may supply different or additional notices on how we process Personal Data specific to certain programs or activities. We may also provide different notices on how we process Personal Data with respect to certain subsidiaries or affiliates, in which case this Notice will not apply.

5. SECURITY AND RETENTION
We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical measures to help protect the Personal Data we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Thus, we cannot and do not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Data safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, enabling multifactor authentication (where available), as well as logging out of your account, and closing your web browser when finished using the Platforms.
In general, we retain your Personal Data as long as necessary for purposes for which the Personal Data was collected and is used by us, as stated in this Notice, and as otherwise necessary to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain appropriate business records, enforce our agreements or for such longer period as required by applicable law. The retention period depends on the information and the reason for which we have collected it. For example, we keep records of customer purchases and transactions in accordance with the relevant return and exchange periods under our return policy.
6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA.
We are based in the United States and are governed by U.S. law, and have operations, entities and vendors in the United States and throughout the world. By accessing or using the Platforms, or otherwise providing information to us, you acknowledge that we collect, process, transfer and store data about you in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or
equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen. We will
take steps to ensure that your Personal Data is subject to appropriate safeguards and receives an adequate level of protection as required under applicable privacy laws, when your Personal Data is transferred to and processed in other jurisdictions, including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data transfer agreements. Please use the contact information below if you have a question or complaint about the policies, practices or manner in which we or our vendors treat your Personal Data.
If you are located in the EEA or the UK, your Personal Data may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other jurisdictions that do not provide equivalent levels of data protection according to the European Commission. In such cases, AEO will take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data, including by putting in place standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission and the UK Information Commissioner, respectively.
