What is Our Cookie Policy?
Cookies are small files that a web server sends to your computer or device when you visit a web site that uses cookies to keep track of your activity on that site. They hold a small amount of data specific to that web site, which can later be used to help remember information you enter into the site (like your email or other contact info), preferences selected, and movement within the site. If you return to the previously visited web site (and your browser has cookies enabled), the web browser sends the small file to the web server, which tells it what activity you engaged in the last time you used the site, and the server can use the cookie to do things like expedite logging in and retrieving user data and keeping your browser session secure.
We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information, and to facilitate eﬃcient and secure access to the Websites. We only use essential cookies. Essential cookies are those necessary for use to provide services to you.  We have provided, below, a full list of our cookies, categorized as described above. We have described the purpose of each, whether they are Helping Minds or Third Party cookies, and how to withdraw consent to their use. We have also indicated which cookies are “session cookies” (which last for as long as you keep your browser open) and “persistent cookies” (which remain on your hard drive until you delete them or they expire).
We may also collect information using pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other similar technologies. These may be used in connection with some Site pages and HTML­formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.

Depending on where You live, You may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.
You are solely responsible for protecting information entered or generated via the Websites that is stored on Your device and/or removable device storage. Helping Minds has no access to or control over Your device’s security settings, and it is up to You to implement any device­level security features and protections You feel are appropriate (e.g., password protection, encryption, remote wipe capability, etc.). We recommend that You take any and all appropriate steps to secure any device that You use to access Our Websites.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE STEPS TAKEN BY US, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OR INTEGRITY OF DATA TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF ANY OF OUR PHYSICAL, TECHNICAL, OR ADMINISTRATIVE SAFEGUARDS. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT AND CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OR INTEGRITY OF ANY PERSONAL DATA YOU TRANSMIT TO US AND YOU TRANSMIT SUCH PERSONAL DATA AT YOUR OWN RISK.
How can You Protect Your Personal Data?
In addition to securing Your device, as discussed above, We will NEVER send you an e­mail requesting conﬁdential information such as account numbers, usernames, passwords, or social security numbers, and You should NEVER respond to any e­mail requesting such information. If You receive such an e­mail purportedly from Helping Minds, DO NOT RESPOND to the e­mail and DO NOT click on any links and/or open any attachments in the e­mail, and notify Helping Minds support at support@trichstop.com.
