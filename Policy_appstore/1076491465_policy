Introduction.
This privacy policy (
“Privacy Policy”
) applies to and
              governs Radish Media, Inc., registered in the state of Delaware
              with offices at 21 W 46th St., Floor 7, New York, New York 10036
              c/o Workhouse NYC (
“Radish”
,
“we”
,
“our”
), our relationship with users (
“users”
,
“you”
) of the Radish Platform in connection with how Radish
              collects information about you during your visits to the Radish
              Platform, how Radish uses and safeguards this information, who
              Radish shares this information with and for what purposes, and the
              choices you can make about how we use this information. Your
              privacy and trust are very important to Radish and it is our
              commitment to be transparent about the use of collected
              information.
By accessing or using the Radish Platform, you confirm that you
              unconditionally accept this Privacy Policy. Please read this
              Privacy Policy carefully before using the Radish Platform. If you
              do not agree to the terms found on this Privacy Policy, you are
              not granted permission to access, view, or otherwise use the
              Radish Platform for any purpose.
We are strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of
              children who visit the Radish Platform. We do not knowingly
              collect Personal Information (as defined below) online from
              children and have adopted techniques to ensure compliance with the
              Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). While
              some Content (as defined in the Content Policy) including, but not
              limited to, the Works and Intellectual Property (as defined below)
              on the Radish Platform may appeal to children, no part of the
              Radish Platform is directed to or targets children younger than 13
              years of age (a “Child” or “Children”), and Children are not
              permitted to use the Radish Platform. On occasion, however, we may
              unknowingly collect Personal Information, such as an email address
              from a Child who submits a question on the Radish Platform. Radish
              strongly urges all parents and legal guardians to (a) talk to
              their Children about online safety; (b) monitor their Children’s
              use of the Internet; and (c) instruct their Children to never
              provide Personal Information online without their permission.
              Under COPPA, all parents and legal guardians have the right to
              review and have any of your Child’s information deleted from our
              records. Parents and legal guardians should be aware that there
              are parental control tools available from other sources on the
              Internet that you can use to prevent your Children from accessing
              or submitting information online without parental permission. If
              you are a parent or guardian and learn that your Child has
              provided Radish with Personal Information without your consent,
              please contact us at
support@radishfiction.com
, and we will take steps to delete such information from our files
              as soon as commercially reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, in the event that you are a parent or legal guardian
              and you permit a Child to use the Radish Platform, you shall be
              solely responsible for monitoring your Child’s use of the Radish
              Platform, you shall be solely responsible for any actions
              undertaken by your Child via the Radish Platform, and you agree
              that Radish shall have no liability regarding the same. For tips
              on protecting your child’s privacy online, please see the U.S.
              Federal Trade Commission’s brochure on this topic:

              User Terms of Service (the

For the purpose of applicable data protection legislation, the
              data controller of your personal information is Radish Media, Inc.
Must-Read
                Sections.
We draw your attention in particular to the sections entitled
              “International Use” and “Your Rights Regarding What We Collect.”
Changes to This
                Policy.
We will post any modifications or changes to the Policy on our
              Radish Platform. You are encouraged to frequently visit the
              following website, specifically at
https://www.radishfiction.com/privacypolicy.html
, to review the current Privacy Policy. Radish will attempt to
              notify you in a reasonable amount of time any changes to the
              Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Radish Platform means
              that you will be bound by the most current revision to the Privacy
              Policy.
What We Collect.
There’s a range
            of information we need to collect about you so that we can operate
            Radish. This information may include:
Information You
                Give Us.
We collect your name, postal address, telephone number, email
              address, your Internet Protocol (IP) Address, and certain
              geographic data (
“Personal Information”
). If you provide
              it, then this information may also include your name and username.
              You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal
              Information that you submit to us. We also collect Non-Personal
              Information.
“Non-Personal Information”
means information that is anonymous or we cannot easily use to
              personally identify you or contact you, including, without
              limitation, your web or mobile browser type, mobile carrier,
              operating system, hardware device type, the URL of the previous
              website you visited, and, upon leaving the Radish Platform, and
              the URL of the next website you go to.
Cookies.
Radish requires that Cookies be enabled on your device(s) so that
              we can identify you as a repeat visitor or customer and maintain
              session information for logged-in users. When you visit the Radish
              Platform, create an Account, or download or purchase Works or
              Services from us, we may set Cookies on your computer or device.
              Cookies are small data files stored on your device by a website.
              Cookies are useful for gathering information, such as usage trends
              and patterns, so that we may better understand your use of the
              Radish Platform, and manage and optimize the Radish Platform for
              users. If you use our Radish Platform from a mobile device, that
              device may send us data about your physical location, which we
              will get your separate permission for before Radish collects
              information about your precise location. Most devices allow you to
              prevent location data from being sent to us and we honor your
              settings upon your action of revoking your consent through the
              settings on your device.
Payment
                Processing.
As of the date of this Privacy Policy, Radish does not store any
              credit or debit card details on or offline. Payments and other
              similar transactions via the Radish Platform are completed by a
              third party payment processor, such as Apple or Google (
“Payment Processor”
), and any purchases you make via the
              Radish Platform shall be additionally governed by the Payment
              Processor’s terms and conditions and/or privacy policies. Radish
              is not liable for the security or performance of the Payment
              Processor. Radish reserves the right to immediately change our
              Payment Processors at any time without notice to you. Additional
              Payment Processor terms concerning a writer’s Account and the
              monetization of Works provided or uploaded by a writer can be
              found on Radish’s Writer Content Policy.
Information We
                Give to Others.
From time to time, a third party may be able to collect
              information about you in connection with your use of the Radish
              Platform, including, without limitation, by authenticating your
              Account via Facebook or when we authorize a third party to render
              services to us, such as via a Payment Processor. Certain features
              of the Radish Platform may also allow you to voluntarily provide
              Personal Information to third parties. When you opt to
              authenticate or otherwise link your Account with a third party
              service, voluntarily submit Personal Information to a third party,
              or an authorized third party receives such information, your
              Personal Information may not be under our control. Radish
              encourages you to review the terms and conditions and privacy
              policies of any third-party website or platform that you visit or
              allow access to. We may share Non-Personal Information collected
              by Cookies with third parties in accordance with this Privacy
              Policy, but Radish will not sell it to third parties. Radish will
              only use such it for Radish’s own business, marketing, and
              administrative purposes.
Newsletters.
At various times we may ask you to provide us Personal Information
              in order to receive recurring informational or promotional
              newsletters via email, or otherwise through mobile applications,
              from us and/or directly from third parties (
“Newsletters”
).
              When you sign up for Newsletters, or at any time you use the
              Radish Platform thereafter, you may unsubscribe from Newsletters
              by following the directions included in the Newsletter or by
              visiting your Account. We will take commercially reasonable steps
              to implement your opt-out and unsubscribe requests promptly, but
              you may still receive communications from us for up to ten
              business days as we process your request.
Surveys.
From time to time, we may use Non-Personal Information to conduct
              research surveys, including, without limitation, through email
              invitations, pop-up surveys, and online focus groups (each a
              “Survey”) for our internal use. If you submit Personal Information
              in a Survey, we or authorized third parties may use it for
              research and measurement purposes related to the Radish Platform.
              When a Survey collects Personal Information we will not knowingly
              accept participants who are under the age of 13, and will treat
              any such information in accordance with the terms and conditions
              herein and in the Terms. Surveys conducted by or on behalf of us
              will contain a link to the Terms. If your browser is not enabled
              to accept Cookies, you may not be able to participate in a Survey.
Your Rights Regarding What We Collect.
In some
              circumstances, you may control the amount of Personal Information
              that is accessible to us by adjusting the account privacy settings
              on your Account page or via certain privacy controls contained on
              a social media account you have with a third party. Radish makes
              it easy for you to keep certain aspects of your Personal
              Information accurate, complete, and up to date. To review or
              update certain of your Personal Information, or to alter your
              email preferences, or preferences regarding Personal Information,
              visit your Account page on the Radish Platform. If you do not want
              us to use your Personal Information as provided in this Privacy
              Policy, or otherwise as stated in the Terms, you should not use
              any part of the Radish Platform that collects Personal
              Information, such as forms requesting Personal Information (for
              example, creating an Account).
If at any time you
              would like to close your Account, please send an email to
              support@radishfiction.com. Personal Information will be removed
              from our active user database and will be deleted as long as you
              are current with all payment obligations owed to and we do not
              believe it reasonably necessary to retain such information for any
              pending legal action or other legal obligation. We will only keep
              Personal Information for a limited period of time as reasonably
              necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory
              requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud
              and abuse, and enforce our Terms.
Please be aware
              that in the event of Account closure, any unfulfilled sales or
              subscriptions may be cancelled without refund and it is your
              responsibility to request a refund from applicable third party
              merchants or vendors, which may be a Payment Processor, such as
              contacting Apple for a refund through the Apple App Store or
              Google for a refund through the Play Store. In the event such
              applicable third party grants a refund, the refund may be charged
              back to you through the Radish Platform, subject to the terms and
              conditions between Radish and such third parties. For the
              avoidance of doubt, you understand and acknowledge that Radish
              does not directly handle refunds.
If you later
              determine you wish to use certain features of the Radish Platform
              again, you may have to register a new Account and the most up to
              date Privacy Policy will apply to such Account.

              have no obligation to delete any public comments, reviews, chat
              messages, comments, or message board postings, or the like you
              make and post to the Radish Platform, even if such material
              contains Personal Information, as Radish cannot reasonably
              anticipate, and is generally unaware, of what you are actually
              contributing to the Radish Platform or including on the Radish
              Platform. Nonetheless, please contact Radish at
support@radishfiction.com
and Radish, in Radish’s sole and reasonable discretion, may assist
              you in deleting such content.
Exclusions.
This Privacy Policy
              does not apply to Submissions and any materials that you post or
              otherwise make available on the Radish Platform in a public way.
              PLEASE DO NOT POST OR ADD PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE RADISH
              PLATFORM IN A PUBLIC WAY THAT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO BE PUBLICLY
              AVAILABLE.
We are not
              responsible for the actions of others, as further outlined in the
              Terms. You should not assume that your Personal Information, or
              any other communication you post or add to the Radish Platform
              will be kept private. We do not control information that other
              users of the Radish Platform have copied out of the Radish
              Platform.
International Uses.
As further
              described in the Terms, the Radish Platform is directed to, and is
              for use by, only users in the United States. Please be aware, if
              you use the Radish Platform outside of the United States, that any
              information Radish collects may be transferred to, stored, and/or
              processed in the United States or may be sent back out of the
              United States to your country of residence or elsewhere in the
              normal course of Radish providing the Radish Platform.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Radish may transfer any information
              or data to any other country in which Radish chooses to operates
              in the future.
Depending on your
              location, you may also have certain additional rights by law with
              respect to your information, such as: (i) data access and
              portability; (ii) data correction; (iii) data deletion; and (iv)
              withdrawal of consent or objection to processing, including, in
              limited circumstances, the right to ask Radish to stop processing
              your personal data, with some exceptions, by contacting us. For
              data that may be subject to the European Union’s General Data
              Protection Regulation (GDPR), Radish relies on several legal bases
              to process your data, including, without limitation, when you have
              given Radish your consent for Personal Information, which you may
              withdraw at any time in accordance with this Privacy Policy (such
              as deleting your Account), when the processing of data is
              necessary to perform services or obligations to you, and for
              Radish’s legitimate business interests, such as offering,
              improving, and personalizing the Radish Platform for you and
              marketing new features or products that may be of interest to you.

Privacy Policy
Introduction.
This privacy policy (
“Privacy Policy”
) applies to and
                governs Radish Media, Inc., registered in the state of Delaware
                with offices at 21 W 46th St., Floor 7, New York, New York 10036
                c/o Workhouse NYC (
“Radish”
,
“we”
,
“our”
), our relationship with users (
“users”
,
“you”
) of the Radish Platform in connection with how Radish
                collects information about you during your visits to the Radish
                Platform, how Radish uses and safeguards this information, who
                Radish shares this information with and for what purposes, and the
                choices you can make about how we use this information. Your
                privacy and trust are very important to Radish and it is our
                commitment to be transparent about the use of collected
                information.
By accessing or using the Radish Platform, you confirm that you
                unconditionally accept this Privacy Policy. Please read this
                Privacy Policy carefully before using the Radish Platform. If you
                do not agree to the terms found on this Privacy Policy, you are
                not granted permission to access, view, or otherwise use the
                Radish Platform for any purpose.
We are strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of
                children who visit the Radish Platform. We do not knowingly
                collect Personal Information (as defined below) online from
                children and have adopted techniques to ensure compliance with the
                Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). While
                some Content (as defined in the Content Policy) including, but not
                limited to, the Works and Intellectual Property (as defined below)
                on the Radish Platform may appeal to children, no part of the
                Radish Platform is directed to or targets children younger than 13
                years of age (a “Child” or “Children”), and Children are not
                permitted to use the Radish Platform. On occasion, however, we may
                unknowingly collect Personal Information, such as an email address
                from a Child who submits a question on the Radish Platform. Radish
                strongly urges all parents and legal guardians to (a) talk to
                their Children about online safety; (b) monitor their Children’s
                use of the Internet; and (c) instruct their Children to never
                provide Personal Information online without their permission.
                Under COPPA, all parents and legal guardians have the right to
                review and have any of your Child’s information deleted from our
                records. Parents and legal guardians should be aware that there
                are parental control tools available from other sources on the
                Internet that you can use to prevent your Children from accessing
                or submitting information online without parental permission. If
                you are a parent or guardian and learn that your Child has
                provided Radish with Personal Information without your consent,
                please contact us at
support@radishfiction.com
, and we will take steps to delete such information from our files
                as soon as commercially reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the
                foregoing, in the event that you are a parent or legal guardian
                and you permit a Child to use the Radish Platform, you shall be
                solely responsible for monitoring your Child’s use of the Radish
                Platform, you shall be solely responsible for any actions
                undertaken by your Child via the Radish Platform, and you agree
                that Radish shall have no liability regarding the same. For tips
                on protecting your child’s privacy online, please see the U.S.
                Federal Trade Commission’s brochure on this topic:

                that you will be bound by the most current revision to the Privacy
                Policy.
What We Collect.
There’s a range
              of information we need to collect about you so that we can operate
              Radish. This information may include:
Information You
                  Give Us.
We collect your name, postal address, telephone number, email
                address, your Internet Protocol (IP) Address, and certain
                geographic data (
“Personal Information”
). If you provide
                it, then this information may also include your name and username.
                You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal
                Information that you submit to us. We also collect Non-Personal
                Information.
“Non-Personal Information”
means information that is anonymous or we cannot easily use to
                personally identify you or contact you, including, without
                limitation, your web or mobile browser type, mobile carrier,
                operating system, hardware device type, the URL of the previous
                website you visited, and, upon leaving the Radish Platform, and
                the URL of the next website you go to.
Cookies.
Radish requires that Cookies be enabled on your device(s) so that
                we can identify you as a repeat visitor or customer and maintain
                session information for logged-in users. When you visit the Radish
                Platform, create an Account, or download or purchase Works or
                Services from us, we may set Cookies on your computer or device.
                Cookies are small data files stored on your device by a website.
                Cookies are useful for gathering information, such as usage trends
                and patterns, so that we may better understand your use of the
                Radish Platform, and manage and optimize the Radish Platform for
                users. If you use our Radish Platform from a mobile device, that
                device may send us data about your physical location, which we
                will get your separate permission for before Radish collects
                information about your precise location. Most devices allow you to
                prevent location data from being sent to us and we honor your
                settings upon your action of revoking your consent through the
                settings on your device.
Payment
                  Processing.
As of the date of this Privacy Policy, Radish does not store any
                credit or debit card details on or offline. Payments and other
                similar transactions via the Radish Platform are completed by a
                third party payment processor, such as Apple or Google (
“Payment Processor”
), and any purchases you make via the
                Radish Platform shall be additionally governed by the Payment
                Processor’s terms and conditions and/or privacy policies. Radish
                is not liable for the security or performance of the Payment
                Processor. Radish reserves the right to immediately change our
                Payment Processors at any time without notice to you. Additional
                Payment Processor terms concerning a writer’s Account and the
                monetization of Works provided or uploaded by a writer can be
                found on Radish’s Writer Content Policy.
Information We
                  Give to Others.
From time to time, a third party may be able to collect
                information about you in connection with your use of the Radish
                Platform, including, without limitation, by authenticating your
                Account via Facebook or when we authorize a third party to render
                services to us, such as via a Payment Processor. Certain features
                of the Radish Platform may also allow you to voluntarily provide
                Personal Information to third parties. When you opt to
                authenticate or otherwise link your Account with a third party
                service, voluntarily submit Personal Information to a third party,
                or an authorized third party receives such information, your
                Personal Information may not be under our control. Radish
                encourages you to review the terms and conditions and privacy
                policies of any third-party website or platform that you visit or
                allow access to. We may share Non-Personal Information collected
                by Cookies with third parties in accordance with this Privacy
                Policy, but Radish will not sell it to third parties. Radish will
                only use such it for Radish’s own business, marketing, and
                administrative purposes.
Newsletters.
At various times we may ask you to provide us Personal Information
                in order to receive recurring informational or promotional
                newsletters via email, or otherwise through mobile applications,
                from us and/or directly from third parties (
“Newsletters”
).
                When you sign up for Newsletters, or at any time you use the
                Radish Platform thereafter, you may unsubscribe from Newsletters
                by following the directions included in the Newsletter or by
                visiting your Account. We will take commercially reasonable steps
                to implement your opt-out and unsubscribe requests promptly, but
                you may still receive communications from us for up to ten
                business days as we process your request.
Surveys.
From time to time, we may use Non-Personal Information to conduct
                research surveys, including, without limitation, through email
                invitations, pop-up surveys, and online focus groups (each a
                “Survey”) for our internal use. If you submit Personal Information
                in a Survey, we or authorized third parties may use it for
                research and measurement purposes related to the Radish Platform.
                When a Survey collects Personal Information we will not knowingly
                accept participants who are under the age of 13, and will treat
                any such information in accordance with the terms and conditions
                herein and in the Terms. Surveys conducted by or on behalf of us
                will contain a link to the Terms. If your browser is not enabled
                to accept Cookies, you may not be able to participate in a Survey.
Your Rights Regarding What We Collect.
In some
                circumstances, you may control the amount of Personal Information
                that is accessible to us by adjusting the account privacy settings
                on your Account page or via certain privacy controls contained on
                a social media account you have with a third party. Radish makes
                it easy for you to keep certain aspects of your Personal
                Information accurate, complete, and up to date. To review or
                update certain of your Personal Information, or to alter your
                email preferences, or preferences regarding Personal Information,
                visit your Account page on the Radish Platform. If you do not want
                us to use your Personal Information as provided in this Privacy
                Policy, or otherwise as stated in the Terms, you should not use
                any part of the Radish Platform that collects Personal
                Information, such as forms requesting Personal Information (for
                example, creating an Account).
If at any time you
                would like to close your Account, please send an email to
                support@radishfiction.com. Personal Information will be removed
                from our active user database and will be deleted as long as you
                are current with all payment obligations owed to and we do not
                believe it reasonably necessary to retain such information for any
                pending legal action or other legal obligation. We will only keep
                Personal Information for a limited period of time as reasonably
                necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory
                requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud
                and abuse, and enforce our Terms.
Please be aware
                that in the event of Account closure, any unfulfilled sales or
                subscriptions may be cancelled without refund and it is your
                responsibility to request a refund from applicable third party
                merchants or vendors, which may be a Payment Processor, such as
                contacting Apple for a refund through the Apple App Store or
                Google for a refund through the Play Store. In the event such
                applicable third party grants a refund, the refund may be charged
                back to you through the Radish Platform, subject to the terms and
                conditions between Radish and such third parties. For the
                avoidance of doubt, you understand and acknowledge that Radish
                does not directly handle refunds.
If you later
                determine you wish to use certain features of the Radish Platform
                again, you may have to register a new Account and the most up to
                date Privacy Policy will apply to such Account.

                Submissions. In addition, your Account page may appear to others

                messages, comments, or message board postings, or the like you
                make and post to the Radish Platform, even if such material
                contains Personal Information, as Radish cannot reasonably
                anticipate, and is generally unaware, of what you are actually
                contributing to the Radish Platform or including on the Radish
                Platform. Nonetheless, please contact Radish at

                PLEASE DO NOT POST OR ADD PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE RADISH
                PLATFORM IN A PUBLIC WAY THAT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO BE PUBLICLY
                AVAILABLE.

                responsible for the actions of others, as further outlined in the

                for use by, only users in the United States. Please be aware, if
                you use the Radish Platform outside of the United States, that any
                information Radish collects may be transferred to, stored, and/or
                processed in the United States or may be sent back out of the
                United States to your country of residence or elsewhere in the
                normal course of Radish providing the Radish Platform.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, Radish may transfer any information
                or data to any other country in which Radish chooses to operates
                in the future.
Depending on your
                location, you may also have certain additional rights by law with
                respect to your information, such as: (i) data access and
                portability; (ii) data correction; (iii) data deletion; and (iv)
                withdrawal of consent or objection to processing, including, in
                limited circumstances, the right to ask Radish to stop processing
                your personal data, with some exceptions, by contacting us. For
                data that may be subject to the European Union’s General Data
                Protection Regulation (GDPR), Radish relies on several legal bases
                to process your data, including, without limitation, when you have
                given Radish your consent for Personal Information, which you may
                withdraw at any time in accordance with this Privacy Policy (such
                as deleting your Account), when the processing of data is
                necessary to perform services or obligations to you, and for
                Radish’s legitimate business interests, such as offering,
                improving, and personalizing the Radish Platform for you and
                marketing new features or products that may be of interest to you.
