Privacy Policy
haharsw built the Graph Editor app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by haharsw and is intended for use as is.
Graph Editor is a graph building & editing system for iOS and macOS that supports the use of custom actions to implement text workflows.
This privacy policy applies to the main app itself, its embedded frameworks and app extensions, and official examples we provided, but obviously not to actions that you, the user, create yourself. Especially when using networking APIs, please be aware that other terms (of the API service provider) may apply.
Purchases
As we mentioned in pricing strategy, Graph Editor Pro offers a higher discount for early supporters, achieved by accessing the app's purchase items.
This information, which includes subscribed or paid in-app purchases, etc., is anonymous and unrelated to the user's identity, and Graph Editor uses only the initial download date in it to determine if it is an early supporter.
iCloud Sync
Graph Editor implements iCloud sync for most features, it uses the iCloud service provided by Apple. As you can imagine, this service is fairly secure and trusted by users around the world.
More importantly, there's nothing to do with our service, no data will be sent to our server. In fact, we don't even have a server for that.
Data Collected by Graph Editor
In short, the Taio app itself does not collect any data from you. Yes, we don't do any data tracking technology for "Growth Hacking" purpose, we don't even count how many users we have. We just want to provide a graph building & editing environment, and do not care how "success" we are, or how the app is being used by users.
But you should be careful about using some APIs that may request your data, such as location, calendar, and reminders. Especially when you are running an actions that is provided by a third-party organization, double-check it before running.
Other than that, please be confident about our service, all secrets stay on your device, we don't have control over them.
