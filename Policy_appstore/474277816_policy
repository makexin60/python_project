Email address – this is so we can send membership confirmations, member offers and membership updates, along with insights as per the services provided in your membership category. Also, to notify you about changes to our service, or if you are a member through a partner Hotel Club, a change to their service

Our website uses cookies in order to personalise delivery of content based on your experience with our website or social media pages and to track the way in which consumers interact with these sites. We may assign your computer browser a unique random number called a "cookie". We may also use flash cookies, which are managed as browser add-ons.
Your privacy and security are not compromised when you accept a
cookie from our website. A cookie simply contains a large random

browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your
browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has
already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is
different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to
change your cookie preferences.) Flash cookies can be disabled or
the data held deleted by changing your browser add-on settings or
by visiting the website of the add-on manufacturer. If you reject
all cookies, you may not be able to receive personalised
information on our website. To find out more about cookies,
including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage
and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this
to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various
parts of the site. We collect this information in a way which does
not identify anyone. We will not associate any data gathered from
this site with any personally identifying information from any
source.

4. Types of personal data we collect
How we collect data above explained the different ways we might obtain or receive data. Some of that data may be personal data, so please read below to understand the different types we may collect about you. Of course, the types of personal data we collect will depend on how you interact with us.
Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual that can be used to identify the individual. It does not include data or information that cannot be used to identify, or be linked to, any particular individual.
We collect a variety of personal information about our guests, customers and visitors to our website. As our website is not intended for children, we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.
This personal data falls into these categories:
Identity Data
includes title, gender, first name, maiden name, last name, marital status, date of birth, username or similar identifier and an encrypted version of your login/password. If you interact with us through social media, this may include your social media username.
Contact Data
includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.
Financial Data
includes payment card and direct debit/bank account details. See below for additional information on credit card tokenisation.
Transaction Data
includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.
Profile Data
includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses, as well as any data which we have added (for example, using analytics and profiling).
Technical Data
includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.
Usage Data
includes information about how you use our website, products and services.
Tracking Data
includes information we or others collect about you from cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers.
Marketing and Communications Data
includes your preferences in receiving direct marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.
Credit Card Tokenisation
When you pay with a credit card, we tokenise it at the booking stage for data protection purposes. At check in, you can consent to Dorchester Collection storing your credit card for future stays. The card will be stored in a secure, tokenised manner associated with your guest profile until such as time as the card expires or you request to remove the card details. If you would like us to remove your credit card details, please contact  our Reservations team via telephone or at the Front Desk of any Dorchester Collection hotel, or via email at
privacy.DCL@dorchestercollection.com
.
We also collect, use and share
Aggregated Data
such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data, but Aggregated Data is not personal data because it cannot be used to identify, or be linked to, any particular individual. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can identify, or be linked to, you, we will treat the combined data as personal data.
We do not ordinarily collect any
Special Categories of Personal Data
about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.  The only exceptions to this are: (i) if you provide health data to us as part of a spa booking, we will use this to perform our contract with you, and we need your explicit consent to use your health data as part of that; or (ii) you have made the special category data obviously public.
Remember, if you choose not to share personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide the products and services you’ve asked for.
Job applicants
If you apply for employment with us, we may collect your name, gender, date of birth, race/ethnicity, employment status and history, education history, certifications, and other employment-related information in addition to the information listed above.
5. Explaining the legal bases for using personal data
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
Where we need to perform the
contract
we are about to enter into or have entered into with you. For example, when you make a booking at one of our hotels, that’s a contract.
Where it is necessary for our
legitimate interests
(or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. For example, when we carry out fraud screening as part of the check-out process or take steps to keep our website secure.
Where we need to comply with a
legal or regulatory obligation
. For example, keeping records of our sales for tax compliance.
When we are considering legitimate interests, we make sure we think about and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
Generally, we do not rely on
consent
as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than where the law requires it, for example in relation to sending certain direct marketing communications. Where our legal basis is consent, you have the right to withdraw consent any time.
See
How and why we use your personal data
below for more detailed information.
6. How and why we use your personal data
Click here
to see a table explaining how we use your personal data, the types of personal data that applies to and why it is we can do this. When we explain why, we will identify the relevant category from
Explaining the legal bases for using personal data
above, and, where it’s based on being able to do so for our legitimate interests, we will highlight what that legitimate interest is.
We may process your personal data for more than one legal basis depending on how we are using it.
If you apply for employment with us, we will use your personal data to determine your fitness for the position applied for, to make any relevant adjustments during the recruitment process and for equal opportunities monitoring, as well as the purposes listed in the table above.
7. Advertising, marketing and your communications preferences
You could see our adverts in lots of different places, but it doesn’t always mean they’re using your personal data, because we also buy advertising space in the real world, on websites and on social media. If you see one of our adverts on a website and in social media, it may not be directed specifically at you and may simply be there because we’ve bid for the space.
To understand what we think you want, need or would be interested in, we may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Tracking, Usage and Profile Data to form a picture. This is how we tell you about the hotels, services and events, and any special offers or promotions, we think you might be interested in.
To share our news, offers and services, we may use direct marketing by email, phone, text and post. Your direct marketing preferences are made clear on our website, and you can ask us about these any time via our
contact page
.
You may choose to opt in to receive our newsletter on our website. We may also be able to send you relevant direct marketing about our hotels, services and events unless you choose to opt out when making a booking with us, visiting our hotels or making a purchase via the gift shop.
Here are some examples of our direct marketing activities which may be directed specifically at you:
our newsletter via email;
invitations and promotions by post, to tell you about special events at our hotels; and/or
phone calls, to tell you something that might be relevant to you or your business.
You can opt out of direct marketing
at any time. The easiest way to do this is to click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of your email or contact
privacy.DCL@dorchestercollection.com
.
If a third party outside Dorchester Collection wants to use your personal data for their own direct marketing, we will always get your express opt-in consent first.
If you use a third party service to make a reservation at our hotels or restaurants, we may receive your marketing preferences from them. We may record these preferences, so when using these services please make sure you choose your marketing preferences correctly. As we have no control over the preferences which third party booking websites present to you, you should read their privacy policy.
We also work with partners to try and promote the reach of our adverts, using analytics and retargeting. To make sure the adverts you see on websites and social media are relevant, we use Tracking Data to see what you’ve looked at.
We want to give you the best Dorchester Collection experience online. Tracking Data, and in particular cookies, help us to do this by telling us which adverts will be most relevant to you and potential new guests on websites and social media. The cookies used for this purpose are often placed on our website by specialist organisations – and this is also why when you’ve been on the Dorchester Collection website, you might see content from our website again. This includes retargeting.
Cookies can also tell us if you’ve seen a specific advert, and how long it’s been since you have seen it. This is helpful, because it means we can control the effectiveness of our adverts and control the number of times people might be shown our adverts. Cookies also help us understand if you’ve opened a marketing email because we don’t want to send you things you won’t find interesting.
For more information about Tracking Data, in particular cookies, see
Cookies
below.
Almost all the cookies that relate to advertising are part of third party online advertising networks. If you’d like to read about how you can control which adverts you see online, see opt-out programs established by the
Digital Advertising Alliance
(United States), the
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
and the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
. We do not control cookies which
are set by advertising networks.
8. Cookies
Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store via your device. We explain below how we use cookies and how you can use controls on your device (for example, your browser settings) to set your cookie preferences.
Cookies help us to provide you with a good experience when you use our website and also allows us to improve our website and services. We use the following categories of cookies:
Strictly necessary cookies
. These are cookies which are needed to make the website work properly. For example, cookies enable you to log in, make a booking or buy a gift, and make secure payments.
Functionality cookies
. These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This helps us to personalise our content for you and remember your preferences.
Analytical/performance cookies
. These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
Targeting cookies
. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. This forms part of Tacking Data and we may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in
this list
.
Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, and we have no control over this. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.
We can use strictly necessary and functional cookies without consent. We gain your consent for other cookies via the banner that you see the first time you visit our website. You can choose not to consent. You can also block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies.
However, if you do not consent, or use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our site.
Please be aware that if you delete your cookies we will no longer know that you’ve opted out of online behavioural advertising, so our adverts can still appear to you on other websites.
9. Sharing your personal data
We do not sell personal data.
We may share your personal data with the third parties set out below for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. We may also share your personal data if the law otherwise permits or requires it.
We may share personal data with the following categories of third parties:
suppliers and service providers (such as outsourced service providers for administration and hotel management (for example, booking and reservation systems, customer relationship management systems), technology and media services providers, payment processing and fraud prevention providers, fulfilment partners for the gift shop);
Dorchester Collection group and affiliates;
auditors and professional advisers like bankers, lawyers, accountants and insurers; and
government, regulators and law enforcement.
We share personal data with the following specific third parties:
Sabre: to enable reservations at our hotels using their SynXis booking system;
Trybe: to enable spa bookings at our hotels using their spa direct booking system;
Microsoft Dynamics: to send our direct marketing campaigns to prospective and current customers; and
Gallup: to send out guest surveys on our behalf.
We also share data with third parties connected to advertising, retargeting and analytics, but never for cross-context behavioural advertising purposes. For example, we do not share personal data with third parties for the purpose of facilitating targeted advertising on other websites based on your visit to this website. Please see the sections on
Advertising, marketing and your communications preferences
and
Cookies
above for more information about who those third parties are.
If we choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or assets with a third party, we may share your data with them in accordance with applicable law. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
10. International transfers
We are a global business. As such, we share your personal data within Dorchester Collection, which involves transferring your data outside Europe.
Many of our external third parties are based outside Europe, so your data will be transferred outside Europe when they process it.
Whenever we transfer your personal data outside Europe, we make sure it receives a similar degree of protection. To do this, we may implement one of the following safeguards:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission or where we have implemented supplemental safeguard in accordance with applicable law. Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
11. Data security
We want to keep your personal data safe, which is why we’ve put in place appropriate security measures to prevent it being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or shared. We also make sure that only people with a business need to know are able to access your data, including employees, agents, contractors and other third parties. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Unfortunately, sending information over the internet is not completely secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot completely guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site.
It’s also important that you keep your password to our website secure. Please do not share it with anyone.
12. How long we keep your personal data for
We will only keep your personal data for as long as we need to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To decide how long we should keep your personal data for, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or sharing of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law we have to keep basic information about our guests and customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In some circumstances we may remove your identity from your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
13. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, which may vary based on your country, province, or state of residence. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:
Request access to your personal data
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of your personal data
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data
This enables you to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing your personal data
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request transfer of your personal data
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Right to withdraw consent
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please see
How to contact Dorchester Collection about privacy
below.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not shared with anyone who doesn’t have the right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for more information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you’ve made a number of requests. In this case, we will let you know and keep you updated.
Authorized agents
To designate an authorized agent you must (1) verify your own identity directly with us; and (2) provide the authorized agent with written documentation of their authority to act on your behalf, such as: (a) a power of attorney; or (b) sufficient evidence to show that you have provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf and directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
Non-discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.
Appealing requests
If you are a Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia resident, you may appeal our decision to your request regarding your personal data. To do so, please contact us in any of the ways listed below. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required.

16. If you choose not to give us your personal data
When you make a booking with us for accommodation, hospitality, spa treatments or other services, we may need to collect some of your personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you. This means that if you decide not to give us your data, we might not be able to provide the service, and may have to cancel your booking or gift shop purchase. We will let you know if this is the case at the time, so you can decide what you’d like to do.
17. Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

If you think we have received personal data from children or those under the age of 16, please contact us immediately.
19. Changes to this privacy policy
We reserve the right to change our privacy policy from time to time. If anything changes in this privacy policy in future, we will post the details on the page or send you an email if appropriate..

How we store and process your data
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law we have to keep basic information about our members (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being members (for tax purposes). In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information. We may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your account data will be collected stored and processed within the UK & Ireland only. Your data will be stored as described here or until you request removal of your personal data from our system. Please note that we will be unable to carry out your request to be removed if there is still an open transaction against your account. In order to provide updates and offers that may be of interest to you we use recognised third parties to take payment, manage our company accounts and provide banking services. We will store transactions, payment (this does not include payment card data) and order data for up to 7 years or for as long as required by UK financial and company regulations. These third parties may operate outside the EU.
We will only use your personal data when legally permitted. The most common uses of your personal data are:
Where we need to perform the contract between us
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation
Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal ground for processing your personal data, other than in relation to sending marketing communications to you via email, post or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
Set out below is a description of the ways we intend to use your personal data and the legal grounds on which we will process such data. We have also explained what our legitimate interests are where relevant.
We may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground, depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center
.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account
. Stripe offers a service called "Link," which allows you to create an account and store information for future interactions with Stripe’s Services and Business Users. You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.
Learn More
.
You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.
Learn More
.
More
. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Users, including about your online activity and your engagement with our End User Services, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users
Services
. We use and share your Personal Data to provide the End User Services to you, which includes support, personalization (such as language preferences and setting choices), and communication about our End User Services (such as communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, Stripe may use cookies and similar technologies or the data you provide to our Business Users (such as when you input your email address on a Business User’s website) to recognize you and help you use Link when visiting our Business User’s website. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s
Cookie Policy
.
Our Business Users.
When you use Link to make payments with our Business Users, we share your Personal Data, including name, contact information, payment method details, and Transaction Data with those Business Users.
Learn More
. You can also direct Stripe to share your saved bank account information and identity documents with Business Users you do business with. Once we share your Personal Data with Business Users, we may process that Personal Data as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of the Business Users’ you do business with for information on how they use the information shared with them.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention
. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and Financial Partners, including detecting unauthorized purchases. We may provide Business Users and Financial Partners, including those that use our fraud prevention-related Business Services (such as Stripe Radar), with Personal Data about you (including your attempted transactions) so that they can assess the fraud or loss risk associated with the transaction. Learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users and Financial Partners

and

.
Advertising
. Where permitted by applicable law, we may use your Personal Data, including Transaction Data, to assess your eligibility for, and offer you, other End User Services or promote existing End User Services, including through co-marketing with partners such as Stripe Business Users.
Learn more
. Subject to applicable law, including any consent requirements, we use and share End User Personal Data with third party partners to allow us to advertise our End User Services to you, including through interest-based advertising, and to track the efficacy of such ads. We do not transfer your Personal Data to third parties in exchange for payment, but we may provide your data to third-party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our Services to you.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing your Personal Data.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Customers
Transaction Data
. If you're an End Customer making payments to, receiving refunds or payments from, initiating a purchase or donation, or otherwise transacting with our Business User, whether in-person or online, we receive your Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User.
Learn More
. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transaction with the Business User.
Learn More
. A Business User who uses Stripe’s Terminal Service to provide its goods or services to End Customers may use the Terminal Service to collect End Customer Personal Data (like your name, email, phone number, address, signature, or age) in accordance with its own privacy policy.
Identity/Verification Information
. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

Financial services
. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User. In addition to any Transaction Data we may generate or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we also collect and use your Personal Data to provide and manage these products, including assisting our Business Users in preventing misuse of the cards. Please review the privacy policies of the Business User and, if applicable, our bank partners associated with the financial service (the brands of which may be shown on the card) for more information.
Identity/Verification services
. We use Personal Data about your identity to perform verification services for Stripe or for the Business Users that you are transacting with, to prevent fraud, and to enhance security.
