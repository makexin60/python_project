We have an intra-group data transfer agreement in place which regulates cross-border transfers of your personal data within the Unily Group.
We may also use international suppliers and service providers (the categories of which are available under 'Who receives your personal data'), whose personnel or systems may be located outside of the UK and EEA, resulting in the transfer of your personal data to third countries. In these cases, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection, such as entering into appropriate data transfer agreements incorporating standard contractual clauses or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) and/or European Commission or other applicable regulators or legislators.

How long we will store your personal data for
We may retain your personal data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection (see "how we use your personal data") or as long as required to fulfil our legal obligations. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal data on the basis of the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data being processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of the Personal Data, whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your personal data will be deleted.
For more information on data retention periods, please contact us by using the "how to contact us" information below.
Contractual or statutory requirements on you to provide personal data
In certain circumstances the provision of personal data by you is a requirement to comply with the law or a contract, or necessary to enter into a contract.
It is your choice as to whether you provide us with your personal data necessary to enter into a contract or as part of a contractual requirement. If you do not provide your personal data then the consequences of failing to provide your personal data is that we may not be able to perform to the level you expect under any contract with you. An example of this would be where we are unable to provide you with essential information around the service we offer you or confirmation of event registration as we do not have your full details, or where we cannot perform our contract with you at all because we rely on the personal data you provide in order to do so. Please see our terms and conditions for further details.

Button Text
How are data subjects informed about the processing of their personal data?
It is the responsibility of the customer to inform their data subjects about the processing of personal data using the Unily services.

Unily Privacy Notice
and other related privacy documentation.
Button Text

Unily commits contractually in its DPA to notifying customers without undue delay (within 24 hours) of any incident involving the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to customer personal data.

Button Text
How does Unily ensure "privacy by design" in its platform development?
Unily's approach to privacy by design involves a comprehensive review of privacy and data protection concepts during the development (and throughout the lifecycle) of new services and features. Before the release of any new feature, it undergoes a thorough privacy review to ensure it aligns with Unily's rigorous privacy and security programme, as well as the contractual commitments made to customers. Product managers and engineers who design Unily services receive annual training on data protection to ensure they are well-versed in privacy and security principles. Additionally, Unily's Data Protection and Information Security teams support these services, carefully reviewing and providing advice on functionality.
Once a new service or feature is released, it is described in detail in product documentation that is accessible to customers through Universe
, to allow them to carry out their own evaluation of its privacy and data protection aspects. Unily also regularly solicits feedback from its customers to further refine its service functionality.
Button Text
Can you describe the data protection training provided by Unily to its employees?
All staff members are required to complete annual online Data Protection, Information Security, and Records Management training. In addition, Unily offers continuous updates on privacy-related developments and changes to its practices through its company intranet. Furthermore, the Data Protection Team provides customised data protection training sessions for key business areas, and specific training on ISO:27001 has also been provided through third-party consultants. Unily maintains staff records to identify training needs and requirements.
Button Text
What measures and procedures does Unily have in place to evaluate and maintain its own data protection compliance?
Unily implements a range of compliance and internal accountability measures to protect personal data, including internal data protection and information security policies and standards, employee training, and internal audits. Unily makes contractual commitments in its Data Protection Addendum to its customers regarding data protection and security controls, carries out risk assessments to ensure personal data can be transferred adequately outside of Europe, and conducts due-diligence assessments of its vendors, including its sub-processors.
Button Text
How does Unily’s platform facilitate self-service?
Unily provides features that are present in the front-end of the platform which give the user control over their personal data. For example, users of the platform can edit and/or delete the content of their own profiles, posts, comments and so on. This allows users to delete or rectify their personal data.
In addition, personal data on the platform is accessible by customer admins. This means admin users have access to the back-end of the platform and can extract certain personal data to provide this in response to data subject rights requests/information requests. However, there may be instances where Unily’s assistance is required in response to a customer data subject rights request. Unily commits to assisting our customers with these in our DPA and we provide a ticketing log service our customers can use to request this support.
Button Text
Can the Unily platform display a customers’ own privacy notice to their end-users?
Yes, Unily has the capability to facilitate the display of customer privacy notices and other user terms to their end-users.
Button Text
What personal data is shared with your sub-processors?
Our customers ultimately decide what personal data is shared. On a general basis
see here
