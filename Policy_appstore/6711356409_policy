As described above, the Site and Services may use certain Tracking Technologies to collect Usage Data, including first-party Tracking Technologies (those placed directly by us and are used only by us) and third-party Tracking Technologies (those placed by websites, services and/or parties other than us). These Tracking Technologies include those provided by Google Analytics, Datadog, DoubleClick and Meta.
‍
We use Tracking Technologies because it is in our legitimate interests to facilitate, improve and tailor your experience with the Services, run analytics, de-bug and to provide and improve our products and services. For example, we use Datadog to better understand our user’s experience (e.g., how much time is spent on pages, what features they use, what links they choose to click, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain the Services with user feedback. We may associate Usage Data with the device you use to access the Services, or email accounts you use to engage with us.

‍
Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you may be able to control the way in which your devices permit the use of Tracking Technologies. While you do not have to allow us to use Tracking Technologies, they do enable us to continually improve our Services, making it a better and more useful experience for you.
‍
If you so choose, you can choose to disable or delete cookies in your Internet browser at any time. Most internet browsers also enable you to choose whether you wish to disable all cookies or only third-party cookies. For further details, please consult the help menu in your internet browser or the documentation that came with your device. Disabling or deleting cookies may cause some of the Services to work incorrectly, and you may lose any information that enables you to access our Site more quickly and efficiently, including login and personalization settings. While your browser may allow you to transmit a “do not track” / “opt-out preference” signal or other mechanism for exercising choices regarding the collection of information by Tracking Technologies, like many websites, our website is not designed to respond to such signals.
‍
Google and Meta also provide options to customize how your information is collected and used. For example, you can utilize Google Analytics’s Opt-Out Browser Add On
here
, or alter Facebook Ads Display options in your Facebook account. If you apply certain ad blockers or tools to restrict cookies, it may interfere with your ability to opt out.

We only keep your personal information for as long as we need to provide our products and services as described in this Privacy Policy and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it. In determining the length of time we retain information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to continue to administer your account, provide the Services, maintain output and content that you have generated, resolve a dispute, enforce our contractual agreements, prevent harm, promote safety, security and integrity, or protect ourselves, including our rights, property and products. We conduct reviews when appropriate to ascertain whether we still need to keep your information. After you delete the information or the account, it is kept in the backups for the purpose of disaster recovery for 30 days and then automatically and permanently erased.

HeyGen Biometric Information Privacy Notice
Effective as of 20th of June 2024
1.
Introduction
HeyGen is an independent platform for creating synthetic media, allowing users to convert their text to video.
‍
This Biometric Privacy Notice describes how HeyGen, Inc. (“HeyGen”, “our”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, discloses, secures, retains biometric information when you use our services, including our retention schedule and guidelines for destroying biometric information. Please read this Biometric Information Privacy Notice carefully and ensure that you understand it.
‍
By uploading a video to HeyGen, you consent to our collection, use, disclosure, retention and other processing of your biometric information as described in this Notice.
2.
What is Biometric Information?
When we refer to “biometric information,” we mean information generated by measurements of your physical, behavioral, or biological characteristics that are used to identify you. Information like eye, hand, or face scans, fingerprints, or voiceprints may be considered biometric information if they are being used to identify you by technical means. As used in this Notice, “biometric information” includes “biometric identifier”, which means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry.
3.
What Biometric Information Do We Collect?
To create your avatar, we need to scan the video footage that you upload, and we may collect, process, and store information such as face geometry as a result. We use your videos and this information to provide and improve our products and services (including to train the AI models that power our services). We also use your videos and biometric information to verify your identity as part of the avatar creation process, to help us detect and prevent fraud and for other security and compliance purposes.
4.
How Do We Disclose Biometric Information?
We only disclose biometric information as described in this Biometric Information Privacy Notice. We do not sell, lease, trade or otherwise disclose your biometric information for profit. However, we may disclose your biometric information to limited service providers and other vendors who help us provide our products and services.
5.
Security and Retention
We store, transmit, and protect your biometric information using a reasonable standard of care that is at least as protective as the way we store, transmit, and protect other confidential information. Notwithstanding any security measures that we take, it is important to remember that the transmission of data via the Internet may not be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that the collection, transmission and storage of data will always be secure.
‍
We retain your biometric information as long as necessary or relevant to create and maintain your avatar and improve our products and services (as set out in Section 4 above) or for the maximum timeframe permitted under applicable law, whichever occurs first, unless legally required to keep it for a different period. At the end of the retention period, or upon your request, we will permanently destroy your biometric information.
‍
For any questions regarding your biometric information, or to withdraw your consent, please contact us by email at
privacy@heygen.com
. Otherwise, for more information about how we process personal information, as well as your rights and choices regarding our data practices, please review our
Privacy Policy

HeyGen has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.

In some cases we may be legally liable for such onward transfers to third-parties. You can access list of our subprocessors
here
.
With direction or consent. We may also disclose information to third parties, including other users of the Services, when you request, direct or consent to us doing so, such as when you make output or other content available to others, through your use of login integrations and social media widgets or with your consent.
Affiliates. We may disclose information to our affiliates or others within our corporate group.
Legal reasons. In certain circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain data held by us, which may include your personal information, for example, where we are involved in legal proceedings or where we are cooperating or complying with the requirements of legislation, a court order, a governmental authority or law enforcement.

7. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
As described above, the Site and Services may use certain Tracking Technologies to collect Usage Data, including first-party Tracking Technologies (those placed directly by us and are used only by us) and third-party Tracking Technologies (those placed by websites, services and/or parties other than us). These Tracking Technologies include those provided by Google Analytics, Datadog, DoubleClick and Meta.
‍
We use Tracking Technologies because it is in our legitimate interests to facilitate, improve and tailor your experience with the Services, run analytics, de-bug and to provide and improve our products and services. For example, we use Datadog to better understand our user’s experience (e.g., how much time is spent on pages, what features they use, what links they choose to click, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain the Services with user feedback. We may associate Usage Data with the device you use to access the Services, or email accounts you use to engage with us. We also use Tracking Technologies for advertising related purposes, including for remarketing and to deliver targeted ads to you, and analyze and measure the effectiveness of our advertisements. We use cookies on our Site in accordance with current English and EU Cookie Laws, and if you are in the EU or UK, we request your consent before dropping Tracking Technologies that are not strictly necessary for the Services.
‍
Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you may be able to control the way in which your devices permit the use of Tracking Technologies. While you do not have to allow us to use Tracking Technologies, they do enable us to continually improve our Services, making it a better and more useful experience for you.
‍
If you so choose, you can choose to disable or delete cookies in your Internet browser at any time. Most internet browsers also enable you to choose whether you wish to disable all cookies or only third-party cookies. For further details, please consult the help menu in your internet browser or the documentation that came with your device. Disabling or deleting cookies may cause some of the Services to work incorrectly, and you may lose any information that enables you to access our Site more quickly and efficiently, including login and personalization settings. While your browser may allow you to transmit a “do not track” / “opt-out preference” signal or other mechanism for exercising choices regarding the collection of information by Tracking Technologies, like many websites, our website is not designed to respond to such signals.
‍
Google and Meta also provide options to customize how your information is collected and used. For example, you can utilize Google Analytics’s Opt-Out Browser Add On
here
, or alter Facebook Ads Display options in your Facebook account. If you apply certain ad blockers or tools to restrict cookies, it may interfere with your ability to opt out.
8. How Long Do We Store Your Information?
We only keep your personal information for as long as we need to provide our products and services as described in this Privacy Policy and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it. In determining the length of time we retain information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to continue to administer your account, provide the Services, maintain output and content that you have generated, resolve a dispute, enforce our contractual agreements, prevent harm, promote safety, security and integrity, or protect ourselves, including our rights, property and products. We conduct reviews when appropriate to ascertain whether we still need to keep your information. After you delete the information or the account, it is kept in the backups for the purpose of disaster recovery for 30 days and then automatically and permanently erased.
‍
If you submit a request to delete your information, we strive to take steps to delete that information within 72 hours of your request, unless we are required or permitted to retain such information under applicable law. For additional information, see “Summary of Your Rights” below.
9. How Do We Secure Your Information?
Data security is of great importance to us, and to protect your personal information, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard and secure personal information collected through our Site. You can review them
here
.
‍
Notwithstanding any security measures that we take, it is important to remember that the transmission of data via the Internet may not be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that the collection, transmission and storage of data will always be secure. Please take suitable precautions when transmitting data via the Internet to us.
‍
Pursuant to the DPF Program, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under the DPF, should direct their query to
privacy@heygen.com
. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
‍
We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to
privacy@heygen.com
.
