Privacy
Privacy, as rule
My apps treat you the way I would want to be treated. This rule applies to everything I design and buildâ€¦
We don't collect personal information such as your identity, location, or favorite Youtuber.
This app utilizes anonymous usage data from TelemetryDeck for product optimization.
It operates by triggering a counter each time you tap somewhere, and that's all it does.
No location, IP address, user ID, cross-tracking, or data analysis based on your personal information such as age, blood type, or hair color.
Respecting your privacy is a rule for me.
Security, as principle
You don't need to open an account or share your email address with this app. I prioritize your privacy and don't want to handle your private data. It's that straightforward.
Security is not optional for me.
This app uses iCloud for syncing your data across devices by default.
It's simply the exact same service that your phone utilizes to store your contact list. No less, no more.
Respectful, as value
Thank you for finding and using this app! It means a lot to me as it is the result of hours of work on my spare time. You are a hero for supporting my efforts, and I truly appreciate it!
Respecting others is an essential human right that should be upheld and prioritized, regardless of one's identity. I am committed to ensuring that the products I create are inclusive and considerate of everyone.
If you happen to come across anything that may not align with this rule, principle, or value, kindly reach out to me without delay.
