Pulsar Chess Privacy Policy
Pulsar chess does not collect any data or transmit any data or connect to the internet.  Any data in app such as the users log file can only be seen by the user unless they mail it out and not myself or any third parties.
Emails and other data sent to support can be saved.  This is used to gauge customer feedback over time.
In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we will not save knowingly any data from children under 13. If you are under 13 and contacting us or a parent please do not send personally identifiable information.   If we find out a correspondence is from someone under 13 or are contacted about this we will purge any data sent to support after the issue is resolved.  We do not share information sent to support with any third parties
Any changes in this policy will be updated here and also require an update of the App as the app at present cannot collect any data. There are currently no plans for that.
Effective January 1st, 2018.  Pulsar is written and owned by Michael Ronald Adams, USA.
