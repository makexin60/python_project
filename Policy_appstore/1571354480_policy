At
MountainXperience
, we spend so much of our time on Wales’ highest mountain that it’s essential we have the best weather forecast available so we produced our own app.
The
Snowdon Summit Weather app
for your iPhone (Android version coming soon) provides accurate, live and up-to-date weather forecasts for the the summit of snowdon. Never worry about getting caught off-guard by the changing mountain weather. Just keep the app on your iPhone and you’ll always be prepared.
The app provides three-hourly forecasts for the next five days for:
– Probability of precipitation
– Temperature
– Feels like temperature
– Visibility
– Wind direction
– Wind speed
– Wind gust
​And best of all, it’s absolutely free!
If you have any questions or issues with the app, please
