5. DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
        Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users
        intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no
        industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our sites do not
        currently process or respond to "do-not-track" (DNT) settings in your web browser. If and when a final
        standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
Certain third parties, such as ad networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms, collect
        information about your online activities over time and across websites. These third parties may not change their
        tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT
        settings. Information about how to opt out from your data being used by third parties can be found above under
        "Information collected by automated means."
6. SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS
We maintain a presence on several social networking and blogging platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Google,
        LinkedIn, Twitter, Snap, TikTok and Pinterest. We may incorporate some third-party social networking features into our
        Services (including, allowing users to interact with others and share certain content and information on social media
        platforms) or utilize third-party provided platforms to publish or manage the Services or portions thereof. Through
        these platforms and features, we receive or may share information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that
        information as well. In addition, some providers of third-party social media or blogging platforms we utilize have
        their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them may collect, use and protect your
        information (e.g., if you establish an account with such platform providers directly). By using social features, you
        agree to those third parties' privacy policies and terms of use.
If you choose to communicate with us or another user through social features available on our websites or mobile
        applications or through our social media pages, or other similar communication or messaging features or services, such
        information may be made publicly available.
For security purposes, please do not include any password, social security number, payment card or other sensitive
        information via these features.
We have the right, but not the obligation to monitor messages and communications between and among users for
        security and training purposes. We may, but are not obligated to, remove any content we deem inappropriate.
7. INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA)
Your Choices and Rights.
As a resident of the EEA, you may have some or all of the following rights in relation to how we use your personal
        information:
Access: you may request access to your personal information and receive copies of it;
Correction: you may have inaccurate/incomplete personal information corrected and updated;
Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: you can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information
          or to limit our use of it;
Deletion: in certain circumstances, you can request a right "to be forgotten" (this is a right to have
          your information deleted or our use of your data restricted). We will honor such requests unless we have to retain
          this information to comply with a legal obligation or unless we have an overriding interest to retain it;
Portability: in certain circumstances, exercise the right to data portability (this is a right to obtain a
          transferable version of your personal information to transfer to another provider); and
Consent Management: where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw consent at any time.
          You do not have to provide a reason for your withdrawal where processing is based on consent.
If you are a resident of the EEA and you wish to access, change or delete personal information we hold about you,
          you may contact us here. If we change or delete your personal information or if you decline to actively share certain
          personal information with us, we may not be able to provide you with our Services or some of the features and
          functionality of our Services. Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is
          unlawful or if it may infringe on the rights and freedoms of another person. For example, we may not be able to
          accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would
          not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.
For your protection, we may require proof of identity and verification before we can answer the above
          requests.
Legal basis for processing data
In this section, we identify the legal grounds on which we rely to process personal information.
In some cases, we have a legitimate interest to process the personal information that we collect, such as to develop,
        administer and support our products and services; to operate, evaluate and improve our business; to facilitate and
        manage engagement programs; to promote research; to support our recruitment activities; or to facilitate a Corporate
        Transaction (including a sale of assets or merger or acquisition).
In other cases, we process personal information to fulfill our contracts with business partners, such as third parties
        that distribute our products.
It may also be necessary for us to process personal information to establish, exercise or defend against fraud,
        illegal activity, and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that govern the
        services we provide.
Our processing of certain information may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations, and for reasons of public
        interest, such as with respect to adverse event and product safety reporting.
We may also process personal information as specifically permitted by applicable legal requirements.
If we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, we will seek such consent at the time we
        collect your personal information.
International data transfers
We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally
        collected for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. For example, if you are located outside of the United
        States, we may transfer your personal information to the United States. The countries to which we transfer personal
        information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.
        When we transfer personal information across borders, we consider a variety of requirements that may apply to such
        transfers.
Specifically, we may transfer personal information from the European Economic Area to:
Countries that the European Commissions has deemed to adequately safeguard personal information,
Pursuant to the recipient's compliance with standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), EU-US
          Privacy Shield, or Binding Corporate Rules,
Pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal information pertains, or
As otherwise permitted by applicable EEA requirements.
8. INFORMATION FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") may provide you with rights
        that are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy regarding our use of your personal
        information. The CCPA Notice applies to "Consumers" as defined by the law. This section describes your CCPA
        rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights. See Sections 1 - 4 above to learn what
        information we collect from you and how it is collected, used and shared.
Access to Information and Data Portability Rights
You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the
        period that is twelve months prior to the request date:
The categories of personal information we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which we collected your personal information.
The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your personal information.
The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
A list of the categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no
          disclosure occurred.
A list of the categories of personal information sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred. If
          we sold your personal information, we will explain:
â€¢ the categories of your personal information we have
          sold.
â€¢ the categories of third parties to which we sold personal information, by categories of personal
          information sold for each third party.
You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your
        personal information that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are
        maintaining.
Data Deletion Rights
Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your personal
        information that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Note also that we are not required to delete
        your personal information that we did not collect directly from you.
Exercising Your Rights
To make a request for access, portability or deletion according to your rights under CCPA, mail your request for the
        attention of the Privacy / Legal Department to support@ai-video-generation.app
.
The Verifiable Consumer Request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
          personal information or an authorized representative; and
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to
          it.
Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information
        about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer's personal information (e.g.,
        clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal
        information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the
        reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process,
        store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. We will
        typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon
        a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
Opt-Out
There is not yet a consensus as to whether third party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites and
        mobile apps may constitute a "sale" of your PI as defined by the CCPA. To make a request to opt-out of sale
        under CCPA, send mail to support@ai-video-generation.app
.
We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.
        However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the
        extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial
        incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA that
        can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any
        financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. We may add or change incentive programs
        and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them
        regularly.
9. ONLINE PRIVACY CHOICES AND RIGHTS

        application support email indicated in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Privacy Policy. If we change

        law.
Device permissions
Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as camera and
        microphone as well as push notifications. Where applicable, you can change your settings on your device to either
        consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of
        course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
Uninstall
You can stop all information collection by the app by disabling call forwarding and deactivating your account by
        following the instructions on the Service's Settings screen and then uninstalling the app using the standard
        uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated
        with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be
        able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.
Location information
If you choose to opt-in, some of our apps may collect your device's precise real-time location, and in such cases,
        you may be able to opt out from further allowing us to have access to such location data by managing your location
        preferences in the app and/or on your device.
Marketing Opt-Outs
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and
        Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital
        Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more
        about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for
        serving ads, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA's opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location
        for third party ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative
        ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may
        continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver
        certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads
        (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out
        webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based
        method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be
        effective.
10. DATA RETENTION
Except as provided below, we may retain your personal information for the longer of three (3) years after we become
        aware that you have ceased using our services or for so long as necessary to fulfill any contractual obligation
        governing the information or our legal and regulatory obligations. However, we may not know if you have stopped using
        our services, so we encourage you to contact us at the appropriate support email in the "How to Contact Us"

        through our Services, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure from access by unauthorized
        parties. We have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties
        during or after transmission. If you create an account as part of using our Services, you are responsible for
        maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs under your
account
. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.
If we believe that the security of your personal information in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to
        notify you. If we have your email address, we may notify you by email to the most recent email address you have
        provided us in your account profile. Please keep your email address in your account up to date. You can change that
        email address anytime in your account profile. If you receive a notice from us, you can print it to retain a copy of
        it. To receive these notices, you must check your email account using your computer or mobile device and email
        application software. We may also post a conspicuous notice on our site or notify you through the mobile application.
        You consent to our use of email, text message and/or notification through the app as a means of such notification. If
        you prefer for us to use the postal service to notify you in this situation, please let us know by submitting your
        request here. You can make this election any time, and it will apply to notifications we make after a reasonable time
        thereafter for us to process your request. You may also use this email address to request a print copy, at no charge,
        of an electronic notice we have sent to you regarding a compromise of your personal information.
12. LINKS TO WEBSITES AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT
For your convenience and information, we may provide links to websites and other third-party content that is not owned
        or operated by us. The websites and third-party content to which we link may have separate privacy notices or policies.

        review the privacy policies of such third parties before providing them with any personal information.

        means, such as through a notification on the website or in our mobile applications if we make material changes to how
        your personal information is collected, accessed or otherwise used as a result of your use of the Services or if your
