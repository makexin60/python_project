California Consumer Privacy Rights
Effective as of January 1, 2020, California consumers have certain choices regarding our use and disclosure of personal information, as described below.
Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.
Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.  Note that we are not required to delete personal information that is needed for a number of purposes.
Opt-Out of Sale: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
Non-discrimination: You have the right to non-discrimination based on the exercise of your privacy rights.
Shine the Light Request: You also may have the right to request that we provide you with (1) a list of certain categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (2) the identity of those third parties.  Foodient Ltd. does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your consent or without giving you an opportunity to opt out of such sharing.
How to Submit a Request: To submit an access or deletion request, a Shine the Light request, or to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, email us at
support@samsungfood.com
.  In your email please let us know if you have a Samsung Food account as well as any email accounts that may be associated with your personal information.
Verifying Requests: To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. If you have a Samsung Food account, we may verify your identity by requiring you to sign in to your account. If you do not have a Samsung Food account, or an email address or phone number on file with us, or if the information you provide does not match what is in our records, then we may not be able to process your request, as there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by the CCPA. Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, or an email address on file, and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, we may not be able to process your request at this time.  If you are an authorized agent or parent/guardian making a request on behalf of a consumer or your child, we may require and request additional information to verify that you are authorized to make that request.
Additional Information: To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. We reserve the right to deny your request if we cannot verify your identity or an exemption applies.  In addition, depending on the nature of your request and the risk of fraud, we may not be able to fulfill it.  Where we deny your request in whole or in part, we will inform you of the denial, provide an explanation of our actions, and the reason(s) for the denial.  In the event your request is incomplete or deficient, we will endeavor to inform you how it may be corrected.
Do Not Track: California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Do Not Track (“DNT”) features that allow you to tell a website not to track you.  Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
