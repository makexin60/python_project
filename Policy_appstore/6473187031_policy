Data collection within the apps
I take the protection of personal data very seriously. Therefore, no personal data is collected through my apps. There is no data collection and, as far as possible, no network connections are used. No advertising or tracking is used and no data is passed on to third parties.
However, I cannot prevent Apple from collecting data when you download, purchase or report a crash.
Data acquisition during network communication
The apps automatically transmit data during communication with the server, which are automatically stored by the server in so-called log files. These data are:
Type of mobile device
Operating system used
Language used
Date and time of the request
IP address
