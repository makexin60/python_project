            Rituals Cosmetics continuously ensures that the jurisdictions in which we pay taxes are aligned with the location of value creation and business model.Our headquarter is (and has historically been) based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Due to our central organization and efficient business set-up, we can offer new innovative products on a regular basis. As the key activities generating most value take place in the Netherlands, most of the taxes we pay are paid in the Netherlands.Our organization set-up is fully driven by commercial business considerations. Within the Rituals Cosmetics group we only incorporate local entities in jurisdictions in which we have opened stores or plan to open stores shortly. The list of subsidiaries is fully disclosed annually in our consolidated annual accounts.  We have a transfer pricing policy in place for the intercompany transactions that arise from our centralized model. This policy ensures that the allocation of income between our companies and the remuneration of these companies are ‘at-arm’s-length’ (i.e. in line with what third parties would have agreed on), properly benchmarked and well documented in our transfer pricing documentation.

Rituals Cosmetics Conscious Approach to Tax
Rituals Cosmetics Conscious Approach to Tax
Rituals Cosmetics Conscious Approach To Tax
This document applies to Rituals Cosmetics UK Ltd. which has a duty to prepare a ‘large business tax strategy’ under Schedule 19, paragraph 19 of the Finance Act 2016 for its fiscal year ending on 31 December 2024.
Introduction
Click to expand
At Rituals Cosmetics we take a conscious and responsible approach to managing our global tax position to contribute to a safer and better living environment, allow access to good education and make sure efficient healthcare is available for those that need it. We want to be part of the change we would like to see in this world and in line with this, we are proud that Rituals is a Certified B Corp™ - meaning that we are a company using business as a force for good.
Rituals Cosmetics UK Ltd. is responsible for the activities of Rituals Cosmetics in the UK. In 2024, we operated 88 Rituals retail stores across the UK and employed an average of 455 full time employees. The effective tax rate of Rituals Cosmetics UK Ltd. in 2024 was 27.1% compared to the UK statutory corporate tax rate of 25%.
Our Tax Risk Management
Click to expand
The global Tax Department is fully integrated into the Finance Department, which is centrally organized in Amsterdam and reports directly to the CFO of the Rituals Cosmetics group, who is part of the Board of Directors. It consists of a team of qualified and highly experienced in-house tax professionals, who are fully integrated into our business and are involved in key transactions that are (planned to be) executed. The Tax Department tracks functionality and value creation in close collaboration with all stakeholders involved and reviews transactional documentation to ensure proper implementation from a tax perspective. Experienced external (local) counsels are regularly engaged to help interpret new laws and regulations and to determine how existing laws apply to our business operations and initiatives.
The Tax Department is, amongst other matters, responsible for the tax strategy, identifying and monitoring material tax risks or challenges, implementing and monitoring control frameworks, creating and rolling out relevant fiscal policies, ensuring tax awareness and tax competency within the company amongst teams within the business and staying informed on (national and international) tax developments.
Our Risk Appetite
Click to expand
Within Rituals Cosmetics, we have a code of conduct in place that sets out the behavior we expect from all our employees. Tax evasive behavior is not and will never be accepted. We have robust internal policies and processes, regular trainings and compliance programs to make sure our all our departments and people are aligned with these values.
At Rituals Cosmetics, we continuously ensure that we meet the applicable tax obligations in all jurisdictions in which we operate (including the UK). Any position we take always follows both the spirit and the letter of all applicable laws, regulations and tax policies that apply to us. Our tax strategy focusses on achieving sustainable growth, facilitating scalability and remaining compliant. Our fiscal structure should always be understandable, explainable and manageable for our stakeholders. Tax considerations will never be leading in how our business is operated. We avoid any form of artificial structuring, complicated loopholes or questionable tax schemes.
Our Business Attitude Towards Tax Planning
Click to expand
Rituals Cosmetics continuously ensures that the jurisdictions in which we pay taxes are aligned with the location of value creation and business model.
Our headquarter is (and has historically been) based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Due to our central organization and efficient business set-up, we can offer new innovative products on a regular basis. As the key activities generating most value take place in the Netherlands, most of the taxes we pay are paid in the Netherlands.
Our organization set-up is fully driven by commercial business considerations. Within the Rituals Cosmetics group we only incorporate local entities in jurisdictions in which we have opened stores or plan to open stores shortly. The list of subsidiaries is fully disclosed annually in our consolidated annual accounts.
We have a transfer pricing policy in place for the intercompany transactions that arise from our centralized model. This policy ensures that the allocation of income between our companies and the remuneration of these companies are ‘at-arm’s-length’ (i.e. in line with what third parties would have agreed on), properly benchmarked and well documented in our transfer pricing documentation.
Our Relationship With HMRC
Click to expand
We consult HMRC whenever we are in doubt on the correct interpretation of tax legislation and our obligations. We are committed to engage openly and cooperatively with the HMRC and we provide them with complete information about our business so that they can properly understand and review our transactions and general tax position.
