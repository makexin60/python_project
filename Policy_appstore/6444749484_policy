          - In email, text, and other electronic messages between you and the App

          - Any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the App
          
          Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the App. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to this privacy policy.

          We collect information from and about users of the App:
          
          - Information You Provide to Us: We collect information that you provide directly to us. For example, when you download and use the App, we may collect certain usage data which is sent to Posthog and Billing information which is sent to Revenuecat. No personal repository information is collected by us.
          
          - Information We Collect Automatically: We may automatically collect certain information when you use the App. This information includes your device type and operating system, the date and time of your use, and other usage and performance information.

          How We Use Your Information
          
          We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:
          
          - To present the App and its contents to you
          
          - To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us
          
          - To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it
          
          - To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection

          - To allow you to participate in interactive features on the App
          
          - In any other way we may describe when you provide the information
          
          - For any other purpose with your consent
          
          Data Security
          
          We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.
          
          Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.
          
          The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
          
          We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
