OUR WEBSITE
This cookie policy only relates to your use of our website www.therme.ro and for all its subdomains.   Throughout our website, we may link to other websites owned and operated by certain trusted third parties to provide further information on topics relevant to Therme’s activities.  Such websites may also use cookies or similar technologies in accordance with their own policies.   For privacy information relating to these other third-party websites, please review their policies.
WHAT ARE COOKIES ?
A cookie is a small text file composed of letters and numbers which is placed onto your device (e.g., computer, tablet, smartphone) when you use our website.   After installation, cookies have a limited duration. They are “passive”, meaning that they do not contain software, viruses or spyware and will not access the information on the hard drive of the user’s equipment.
A cookie is composed of two parts:
name of the cookie
and,
cookie value or content.
Technically, only the web server that sent the cookie can access it again when a user returns to the web page associated with the web server in question. These cookies help us to track and examine the use of our website.   For example, we may monitor how many times you visit the website, which pages you go to, traffic data, location data and the originating domain name of your internet service provider. This information helps us to build a profile of our users – what’s useful and what’s not so we can improve the quality of what’s provided online. Some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually.  Other elements of the data may enable identification of individuals, such as monitoring your response to a mailing campaign.   For further information on our use of cookies, including a detailed list of your information which we and others may collect through cookies, please see below.
WHAT TYPE OF COOKIES DO WE USE ?
The cookies are usually grouped into 4 categories, as follows:

Preferences.
These cookies enable the      website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves      or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.
Statistics
. Also called “analytical or      performance cookies”, these cookies allow us to recognise and count the      number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when      they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for      example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for      easily.
Marketing.
These cookies record      your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you      have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the      advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also      share this information with third parties for this purpose.
WHAT IS THE DURATION OF COOKIES ?
Cookie duration can vary significantly, depending on the cookie’s purpose.
The following cookie categories vary in duration:
Session cookies
– a “session cookie” is a cookie that is automatically deleted when the user      closes the browser.
Persistent or fixed cookies
– a “persistent” or “fixed cookie” remains on the user’s device until it      reaches a certain expiry date (which can be minutes, days or even years in      the future) or until the user erases it, at any time, by using the      browser’s settings.
WHAT ARE THIRD-PARTY COOKIES?
Certain content sections of the website can be provided by third parties, not by our website. In this case, the cookies are called third-party cookies. An example of a third-party cookie is Google Analitics. Google Analitics uses cookies to help a certain website analyse the way you use it.

In addition, Google may transfer this information to third parties if it has a legal obligation to do so or if these third parties process the information in the name of Google. Google will not associate your IP address with other data collected by Google. You can reject the use of Google Analytics without any influence on your experience on our website.   Detailed information on Google Analytics and personal data protection (including how you can control information sent to Google) can be found at the address:

This policy has the main purpose to provide you all necessary information you need for understanding what cookies are, how do they work, why do we use them and how you can express your options regarding them.   Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our services.
You can change or withdraw your consent at anytime. To manage your consent options, please scroll down to the section titled "Manage your Consent"

OUR WEBSITE
This cookie policy only relates to your use of our website www.therme.ro and for all its subdomains.   Throughout our website, we may link to other websites owned and operated by certain trusted third parties to provide further information on topics relevant to Therme’s activities.  Such websites may also use cookies or similar technologies in accordance with their own policies.   For privacy information relating to these other third-party websites, please review their policies.
WHAT ARE COOKIES ?
A cookie is a small text file composed of letters and numbers which is placed onto your device (e.g., computer, tablet, smartphone) when you use our website.   After installation, cookies have a limited duration. They are “passive”, meaning that they do not contain software, viruses or spyware and will not access the information on the hard drive of the user’s equipment.
A cookie is composed of two parts:
name of the cookie
and,
cookie value or content.
Technically, only the web server that sent the cookie can access it again when a user returns to the web page associated with the web server in question. These cookies help us to track and examine the use of our website.   For example, we may monitor how many times you visit the website, which pages you go to, traffic data, location data and the originating domain name of your internet service provider. This information helps us to build a profile of our users – what’s useful and what’s not so we can improve the quality of what’s provided online. Some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually.  Other elements of the data may enable identification of individuals, such as monitoring your response to a mailing campaign.   For further information on our use of cookies, including a detailed list of your information which we and others may collect through cookies, please see below.
WHAT TYPE OF COOKIES DO WE USE ?
The cookies are usually grouped into 4 categories, as follows:
Necessary.
Also called “strictly      necessary cookies”, these are cookies that are required for the operation      of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log      into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of      e-billing services.
Preferences.
These cookies enable the      website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves      or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.
Statistics
. Also called “analytical or      performance cookies”, these cookies allow us to recognise and count the      number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when      they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for      example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for      easily.
Marketing.
These cookies record      your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you      have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the      advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also      share this information with third parties for this purpose.
WHAT IS THE DURATION OF COOKIES ?
Cookie duration can vary significantly, depending on the cookie’s purpose.
The following cookie categories vary in duration:
Session cookies
– a “session cookie” is a cookie that is automatically deleted when the user      closes the browser.
Persistent or fixed cookies
– a “persistent” or “fixed cookie” remains on the user’s device until it      reaches a certain expiry date (which can be minutes, days or even years in      the future) or until the user erases it, at any time, by using the      browser’s settings.
WHAT ARE THIRD-PARTY COOKIES?
Certain content sections of the website can be provided by third parties, not by our website. In this case, the cookies are called third-party cookies. An example of a third-party cookie is Google Analitics. Google Analitics uses cookies to help a certain website analyse the way you use it. The information gathered by these cookies on your use of the website (including your IP address) is sent and stored by Google on servers that may be located in the EU, EEA and/or the United States of America. Google uses this information to analyse your use of the website, issues report on the website’s activity for the website operators, and provides other services related to the website’s activity and internet use. In addition, Google may transfer this information to third parties if it has a legal obligation to do so or if these third parties process the information in the name of Google. Google will not associate your IP address with other data collected by Google. You can reject the use of Google Analytics without any influence on your experience on our website.   Detailed information on Google Analytics and personal data protection (including how you can control information sent to Google) can be found at the address:
https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners
.
HOW CAN YOU GET DETAILS ABOUT EACH COOKIE IN PART ?
Cookie declaration provides you detailed information about each cookie in part such as name, type, provider, purpose and expiration date. The information is updated monthly.

Detailed information is also available in the detail section of the cookie banner that shows up when accessing our website.

Identity documents (e.g.: ID card, passport, etc.) to check the minimum age required for access to age restricted areas;
Student card / student / pension card, to check the eligibility of offers for these categories of people
;
Supporting documents for persons with disabilities
, in order to benefit from the offers for people with special needs.
We may ask you to submit these documents (at the time of your visit) for our legitimate interest in allowing access to age-restricted areas or offering discounts to eligible people.
Refusal to submit these documents may result in refusal to grant the benefits purchased or in the process of being purchased.
The aforementioned supporting documents are not recorded or stored in our systems.
THE USE OF AUTOMATION SYSTEMS IN PURCHASING AND PAYMENT PROCESSES
1. Self check-in
Therme offers you a check-in device located in the cash register area that helps you purchase your tickets without the help of Therme staff, thus shortening the time spent at cash registers.
The system uses a computer interface that allows you to select the services you want and make the payment. The check-in system does not process any personal data other than that necessary in relation to the services selected and the details of the card payment.
After this point, the sales process continues at the cash registers, in order to get the bracelet and allow access to the Therme Bucharest complex.
The use of this service is optional and can be used as an alternative to the conventional sales process.
2. Vending machine
It is another IT system located in the cash registers area that you can use to activate tickets purchased online at the time of your arrival at the location. The system scans the QR code on the online ticket, reads and verifies the information on the ticket in the online store’s computer systems and releases the access bracelets. The sales process continues at the cash registers, in order to activate the bracelet and allow access to the Therme Bucharest complex.
3. Self check-out
This IT system is located in the exit areas and allows you to make the payment of the consumption recorded on the bracelet. Subsequently, the bracelet must be handed over to Therme staff at dedicated cash registers. Processing data refers to the data recorded on the bracelet throughout the visit and the details of the card payment.
4. Self invoice
This IT system can be used by you to request and generate your tax invoice. In this regard, the system allows you to scan the tax receipt to provide the necessary information regarding the payment. At the same time, for confirming the company’s data, the system is synchronized to the ANAF database.
The system allows entering additional personal data you want on your invoice, First name and last name, address (for individuals). First name and last name, serial number and ID number (for persons delegated in relation to a company).

This policy has the main purpose to provide you all necessary information you need for understanding what cookies are, how do they work, why do we use them and how you can express your options regarding them.   Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our services.

OUR WEBSITE
This cookie policy only relates to your use of our website www.therme.ro and for all its subdomains.   Throughout our website, we may link to other websites owned and operated by certain trusted third parties to provide further information on topics relevant to Therme’s activities.  Such websites may also use cookies or similar technologies in accordance with their own policies.   For privacy information relating to these other third-party websites, please review their policies.
WHAT ARE COOKIES ?
A cookie is a small text file composed of letters and numbers which is placed onto your device (e.g., computer, tablet, smartphone) when you use our website.   After installation, cookies have a limited duration. They are “passive”, meaning that they do not contain software, viruses or spyware and will not access the information on the hard drive of the user’s equipment.
A cookie is composed of two parts:
name of the cookie
and,
cookie value or content.
Technically, only the web server that sent the cookie can access it again when a user returns to the web page associated with the web server in question. These cookies help us to track and examine the use of our website.   For example, we may monitor how many times you visit the website, which pages you go to, traffic data, location data and the originating domain name of your internet service provider. This information helps us to build a profile of our users – what’s useful and what’s not so we can improve the quality of what’s provided online. Some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually.  Other elements of the data may enable identification of individuals, such as monitoring your response to a mailing campaign.   For further information on our use of cookies, including a detailed list of your information which we and others may collect through cookies, please see below.
WHAT TYPE OF COOKIES DO WE USE ?
The cookies are usually grouped into 4 categories, as follows:
Necessary.
Also called “strictly      necessary cookies”, these are cookies that are required for the operation      of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log      into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of      e-billing services.
Preferences.
These cookies enable the      website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves      or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.
Statistics
. Also called “analytical or      performance cookies”, these cookies allow us to recognise and count the      number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when      they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for      example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for      easily.
Marketing.
These cookies record      your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you      have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the      advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also      share this information with third parties for this purpose.
WHAT IS THE DURATION OF COOKIES ?
Cookie duration can vary significantly, depending on the cookie’s purpose.
The following cookie categories vary in duration:
Session cookies
– a “session cookie” is a cookie that is automatically deleted when the user      closes the browser.
Persistent or fixed cookies
– a “persistent” or “fixed cookie” remains on the user’s device until it      reaches a certain expiry date (which can be minutes, days or even years in      the future) or until the user erases it, at any time, by using the      browser’s settings.
WHAT ARE THIRD-PARTY COOKIES?
Certain content sections of the website can be provided by third parties, not by our website. In this case, the cookies are called third-party cookies. An example of a third-party cookie is Google Analitics. Google Analitics uses cookies to help a certain website analyse the way you use it. The information gathered by these cookies on your use of the website (including your IP address) is sent and stored by Google on servers that may be located in the EU, EEA and/or the United States of America. Google uses this information to analyse your use of the website, issues report on the website’s activity for the website operators, and provides other services related to the website’s activity and internet use. In addition, Google may transfer this information to third parties if it has a legal obligation to do so or if these third parties process the information in the name of Google. Google will not associate your IP address with other data collected by Google. You can reject the use of Google Analytics without any influence on your experience on our website.   Detailed information on Google Analytics and personal data protection (including how you can control information sent to Google) can be found at the address:
https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners

HOW CAN YOU GET DETAILS ABOUT EACH COOKIE IN PART ?
Cookie declaration provides you detailed information about each cookie in part such as name, type, provider, purpose and expiration date. The information is updated monthly.

Detailed information is also available in the detail section of the cookie banner that shows up when accessing our website.
THIRD-PARTY ACCES TO THE COOKIES

Information about the use of your MyTherme account, the purchase of products and services, marketing notifications, the receipt and management of your requests, or other activities that may be carried out through the applications is detailed in the different information Notes. Please refer to the “Privacy Notice” section of the Privacy Policy.
WHAT ARE THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA THAT WE PROCESS?
When you use MyTherme mobile applications, we may process the following personal data:
The IP of your device;

We rely on your consent when we process your data for statistical reports on how you use the App, your preferences when you browse the App, or for other similar marketing and advertising purposes.
In this regard, we ask for your consent in advance each time you log into the MyTherme application.

This context gives you the possibility to withdraw your consent at any time of the processing, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing conducted up to that point. If you are a minor (under the age of 16), a parent or legal guardian has to give consent.
Performance of a contract
may be another legal basis we use in marketing events whenever the processing of your data is conducted in close connection with compliance with contractual terms and conditions agreed by you in advance (acceptance of terms and conditions, signing of contracts, agreements etc.).
There may also be situations in which data processing is necessary for the
fulfilment of a legal obligation
for which Therme is responsible (e.g., fiscal, financial-accounting, physical and cyber security, archiving etc.).
We may also process your data based on
our legitimate interests
such as:
Organizing events and conducting necessary processing activities that do not fall under any other legal basis, but are legitimate, in relation to the purposes and necessity of the processing (organization, registration, selection of winners, etc.);
Checking compliance with the conditions/rules for participation in various events (e.g., age eligibility check);
Collection, storage, and use of media recordings (audio-photo-video) of the events and their dissemination in public spaces for promotion and marketing (social media, website, magazines, publications, etc.);
Keeping written records and supporting documents necessary to defend Therme's rights in court or before the authorities;
Disclosure of data to collaborators, partners, associated controllers, authorised data processors, or authorities who assist us in the planning and running of events;
Defending Therme's rights in court and before the authorities;
Recovery of losses;
Other legitimate interests, in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
Where we use legitimate interest as a legal basis for our activities, we are committed to protecting your data so that the processing does not override your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
WHO ELSE HAS ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
Your personal data may be disclosed, as appropriate, to the following categories of recipients:
-marketing partners
(other Therme group companies, collaborators, partners, joint controllers, organisers, co-organisers, consultants and marketing specialists, etc.);
-service providers
(IT service providers, web application and tool providers, Therme data processors, cloud storage and data transfer service providers, etc.);
For details of our data processors, please see the
list of Therme's data processors
within the Privacy Policy.
Your data as well as media materials may also be disseminated in the public space, from social media (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube), websites, magazines, publications, billboards, etc. and physical locations that can be accessed by an unlimited number of people.
HOW DO WE MANAGE INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER?
As a rule, we process your personal data on the territory of Romania, the European Union and countries that offer an adequate level of protection according to the decision of the European Commission.
Depending on the nature, context and location of the marketing event, your personal data may also be disclosed to international destinations that do not provide an adequate level of protection, such as the United States. In this situation, for the protection of your data, we will take additional protection measures.
To learn more about the conditions under which we may transfer your data to third-party destinations, please refer to the “
International data transfer
” section of the Privacy Policy.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
Data retention periods vary depending on the purpose for which the data is processed and may be influenced by the nature of the event and the legal grounds we use.
So, the criteria based on which we determine the retention or deletion of data are:
Withdrawal of consent,
which entails deletion of the data if it is no longer needed for other purposes.
Legal retention periods,
where there is a legal obligation regarding the length of time data must be kept.
Retention periods laid down in the contract,
where applicable.
Therme's legitimate interests
, where storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis.
Retention periods are assigned to data processed on basis of legitimate interests in accordance with the purposes for which they were collected. We periodically evaluate storage periods to ensure that we only keep data for as long as necessary for the purposes intended.
WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?
Depending on the legal grounds on which we process your data, you have the following rights:
Right to be informed;
Right of access;
Right to rectification;
Right to erasure, under the conditions stipulated by law;
Right to restriction of processing;
Right to data portability to another controller, under the conditions stipulated by law;
Right to object to the processing of your personal data;
Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects on you or similarly affects you to a significant extent, with the exceptions set out in data protection laws;
The right to withdraw consent at any time;
Right to lodge a complaint with
a supervisory authority.
The rights mentioned are not exclusive. Therme will analyse each request individually and will respond to the data subjects considering the nature and context of the processing.
FILMING AND PHOTOGRAPHING EVENTS
Marketing events include promotional and marketing media activities ("media activities") for which photographs and videos ("media materials") are taken that capture the highlights of the events, including images that contain personal data about you (image, voice or other information about you that may be revealed in recordings), including minors present at the event.
Media activities can be conducted by Therme, Therme representatives or other organizers/partners carrying out activities in Therme locations.
In case the event is organised in association with other organisers/partners, the media materials will be used by all parties involved for the purpose of promoting the event or for their own marketing activities. Each party is responsible for the way it uses the media materials.
Legitimacy conditions regarding the processing of media materials
a) Therme's and Therme partners' legitimate interest.
Media activities are carried out based on Therme's and/or Therme partners' legitimate interest to organize and promote events in public and private spaces or other internal marketing purposes of the parties involved (e.g. promoting the current event or similar events in the future, improving Therme's or Therme partners' image and reputation, etc.).
You may object at any time to the use of media materials in which your personal data is disclosed if you believe it violates your right to privacy or significantly affects your rights and freedoms. In this situation, Therme, will review your request and, where possible, stop the processing and order the deletion of the data concerning you. However, there may be certain situations in which Therme will continue to use media materials when there is a well-founded legitimate interest (for example when more than one person appears in the recordings and your data. Where there is a legitimate interest (e.g. where more people appear in the recordings and your personal data cannot be deleted, extracted or anonymised without affecting the usefulness of the recordings, or where the media materials have been disseminated in the online environment or public space where Therme has no control to order their deletion, or where discontinuing the use or deletion of the media materials would require a disproportionate effort or would cause material, financial, or reputational harm to Therme or its partners).
Therme will review each situation individually to ensure that your legitimate interests do not override your rights and freedoms.
b) Consent given in advance
In situations where it is desired to collect and use media material that specifically targets you (close-up shots) for professional use for marketing purposes, without strictly related to the event itself, Therme may request your prior written consent by providing you with an image release or a similar document. For children under the age of 16, consent must be authorized by a parent or legal guardian. In this situation you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent being given.
How the media materials are used
Therme will transmit, distribute, broadcast, communicate media materials in good faith and without further formalities (notifications, agreements, contracts, etc.), both in public and private spaces:
- online/internet/media environment
- including but not limited to websites, social networks (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linked-In, etc.), radio, television or any other online tools that can be accessed globally by an unlimited number of people.
- offline environment
, for internal use within Therme and Therme Group - any written medium, magazines, posters, flyers, books, public or private locations, fixed and mobile equipment, etc.
Therme may make derivative works of any kind from the collected media, which it may use as mentioned above.
Media materials will be used in joined, combined, modified, continuous or interrupted form, etc. without territorial limitation.
Since the purposes for which the media are used are varied and the exact period of use cannot be determined in advance, Therme will keep the media indefinitely.
UPDATING THE PRIVACY NOTICE
The information presented in this Privacy Notice will be reviewed periodically to reflect any changes in current processing activities.
Please visit this page periodically to make sure you always have up-to-date information.
However, if we intend to significantly change the way we use your personal data, we will notify you in advance.

This policy has the main purpose to provide you all necessary information you need for understanding what cookies are, how do they work, why do we use them and how you can express your options regarding them.   Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website.

OUR WEBSITE
This cookie policy only relates to your use of our website www.therme.ro and for all its subdomains.   Throughout our website, we may link to other websites owned and operated by certain trusted third parties to provide further information on topics relevant to Therme’s activities.  Such websites may also use cookies or similar technologies in accordance with their own policies.   For privacy information relating to these other third-party websites, please review their policies.
WHAT ARE COOKIES ?
A cookie is a small text file composed of letters and numbers which is placed onto your device (e.g., computer, tablet, smartphone) when you use our website.   After installation, cookies have a limited duration. They are “passive”, meaning that they do not contain software, viruses or spyware and will not access the information on the hard drive of the user’s equipment.
A cookie is composed of two parts:
name of the cookie
and,
cookie value or content.
Technically, only the web server that sent the cookie can access it again when a user returns to the web page associated with the web server in question. These cookies help us to track and examine the use of our website.   For example, we may monitor how many times you visit the website, which pages you go to, traffic data, location data and the originating domain name of your internet service provider. This information helps us to build a profile of our users – what’s useful and what’s not so we can improve the quality of what’s provided online. Some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually.  Other elements of the data may enable identification of individuals, such as monitoring your response to a mailing campaign.   For further information on our use of cookies, including a detailed list of your information which we and others may collect through cookies, please see below.
WHAT TYPE OF COOKIES DO WE USE ?
The cookies are usually grouped into 4 categories, as follows:
Necessary.
Also called “strictly      necessary cookies”, these are cookies that are required for the operation      of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log      into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of      e-billing services.
Preferences.
These cookies enable the      website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves      or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.
Statistics
. Also called “analytical or      performance cookies”, these cookies allow us to recognise and count the      number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when      they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for      example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for      easily.
Marketing.
These cookies record      your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you      have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the      advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also      share this information with third parties for this purpose.
WHAT IS THE DURATION OF COOKIES ?
Cookie duration can vary significantly, depending on the cookie’s purpose.
The following cookie categories vary in duration:
Session cookies
– a “session cookie” is a cookie that is automatically deleted when the user      closes the browser.
Persistent or fixed cookies
– a “persistent” or “fixed cookie” remains on the user’s device until it      reaches a certain expiry date (which can be minutes, days or even years in      the future) or until the user erases it, at any time, by using the      browser’s settings.
WHAT ARE THIRD-PARTY COOKIES?
Certain content sections of the website can be provided by third parties, not by our website. In this case, the cookies are called third-party cookies. An example of a third-party cookie is Google Analitics. Google Analitics uses cookies to help a certain website analyse the way you use it. The information gathered by these cookies on your use of the website (including your IP address) is sent and stored by Google on servers that may be located in the EU, EEA and/or the United States of America. Google uses this information to analyse your use of the website, issues report on the website’s activity for the website operators, and provides other services related to the website’s activity and internet use. In addition, Google may transfer this information to third parties if it has a legal obligation to do so or if these third parties process the information in the name of Google. Google will not associate your IP address with other data collected by Google. You can reject the use of Google Analytics without any influence on your experience on our website.   Detailed information on Google Analytics and personal data protection (including how you can control information sent to Google) can be found at the address:

Privacy Policy
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH AND OTHER INFORMATION MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED BY PHYXD, INC., d/b/a PHY.
PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
Purpose. This Privacy Policy describes the health information privacy practices of Phyxd, Inc., d/b/a Phy (referred to as “Phy,” “we,” “our,” or “us,” herein). Phy is not a licensed health care provider or a health plan. Rather, Phy offers the Phy Solution to individual users, coaches, trainers or health care providers, (each a “User”), in some cases as a business associate, under the applicable provisions of relevant laws.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection and use of information pertaining to job applicants, employees, owners, directors, officers, or contractors.
This Policy describes the information that we gather from Users of the Phy Solution, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information. By using the Phy Solution, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.
This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Phy Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Phy Terms of Use.
The information we collect through the Phy Solution:
User-provided Information. When you use the Phy Solution, the Phy Solution collects information about you by means of a body scan which would be “personally identifiable” information, “protected health information,” or “personal information” defined as information that specifically identifies an individual. Phy may also collect other forms of personal information including name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal information also includes other information, such as date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may also provide us medical data such as the identity and contact information of your health care provider(s) and part of your medical history and other information that you choose to share with us.
“Cookies” Information. When you visit the Phy Solution, we may send one or more cookies (a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters) or similar code to your Devices. Some of this code may remain on your Devices and may be used by your browser or Devices on subsequent visits to the Phy Solution. This allows us to “remember” what you have done on the Phy Solution before and personalize the Phy Solution for you. Please look through your browser’s or device’s technical support resources to learn the correct way to remove or disable this code. Please note that disabling this code may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality and offerings available via the Phy Solution.
“Automatically Collected” Information. When you use the Phy Solution, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected” information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Phy Solution. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with coaches or providers. This information is gathered from all users.
How we use the information Phy collects. We use information we collect in providing the Phy Solution and operating our business, including the following:
we use the information that we collect on the Phy Solution to offer the Phy Solution scan and analytics, and to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Phy Solution, to provide Phy Solutions and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions, and otherwise to provide support to Users.
we use the information that we collect on the Phy Solution to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the Phy Solution, and to develop new products, services, features, and functionalities.
we may use your email address or other information we collect on the Phy Solution (i) to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer outreach for the Phy Solution, to send reminders, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to User content posted on the Phy Solution or (ii) to send communications, including updates on promotions and events, relating to products and Phy Solutions offered by us and by third parties we work with. Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving any promotional communications by contacting us at
privacy@phy.health
.
we may use “cookies” information and “automatically collected” information we collect on the Phy Solution to: (i) personalize our Phy Solutions, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Phy Solution; (ii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Phy Solution; (iii) monitor aggregate site usage metrics; and (iv) track your scans, entries, submissions, and status in activities on the Phy Solution.
Applicable Law. Phy shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act of 2009, and the regulations promulgated thereto. Phy complies with these federal laws, applicable state laws, including but not limited to the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) as well as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regarding the privacy and security of protected health information. Under the GDPR you have the right to be forgotten and may request deletion of your data from Phy computer systems at any time, by sending an email to
privacy@phy.health
. Any questions or concerns regarding the privacy or security of protected health information on the Phy Solution, or in the Content or Links, shall be reported to the Phy Privacy Officer immediately at
privacy@phy.health
.
How we use your Protected Health Information. Phy is dedicated to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your protected health information (“PHI”). Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), PHI is information about you that may be used to identify you (such as your name, social security number, or address), and that relates to (a) your past, present or future physician or mental health or condition, (b) the provision of health care to you, or (c) your past, present or future payment for the provision of health care. In providing the Phy Solution, we will receive and create records containing your PHI to assist in providing you a better Phy Solution, conduct our management and administrative activities, and otherwise as stated in this Privacy Policy. You may also choose to grant access to your account to your health care provider or communicate directly with your health care provider.
We may also use your de-identified PHI to run (or authorize third parties to run) statistical or other research on individual or aggregate health or medical trends. Such research would only use your PHI in an anonymous manner that cannot be tied directly back to you. We offer the Phy Solution consistent with applicable federal and state laws governing health information privacy and security.
This Privacy Policy describes how we protect your privacy as a User of the Phy Solution, not as a patient receiving care from your health care provider using the Phy Solution. You understand that all information shared with your health care provider is subject to your health care provider’s professional and legal duties of confidentiality and responsibility which we do not control. If you are receiving care through the Phy Solution from a health care provider, you have other rights with respect to the access, use and disclosure of PHI. For a more complete description of a patient’s rights under HIPAA, please refer to your health care provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices, which provides important information to you about how your PHI may be used and disclosed.
When we disclose information. Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose your information that we collect on the Phy Solution to third parties without your consent. we may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
we may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, Phy Solutions, and/or functionality available through the Phy Solution.
we may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright law), in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
we also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Phy Solution and any facilities or equipment used to make the Phy Solution available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.
Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.
