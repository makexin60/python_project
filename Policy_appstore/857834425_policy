Whenever we process your personal information, we must meet at least one set condition for processing. These conditions are set out in data protection law, and we rely on a number of different conditions for the activities we carry out. The table below sets out what we use your personal data for and our legal basis for doing so.

We use algorithms and computer programs to make decisions about whether you are eligible for a product and what terms we can offer you. You can find out more information
here
.
Because we have a
contract
with you, we have to use your data in this way as a
necessary part of that contract.
Once you no longer have the product, we keep your data for a
period of time afterwards
as part of our
legitimate interests
in case needed for a complaint or regulatory enquiry and to help us to lend responsibly.
If you want to ask us to review a decision which we have made based on an algorithm, you can
ask us any time
.
We carry out fraud checks to protect our customers and prevent crime. We use algorithms and computer programs to analyse transactions and data in applications to check for fraud. You can read more about our fraud prevention checks
here
.
The law requires us to do this
as we have 
responsibilities to prevent financial crime. We 
also act in our
legitimate interests
to protect 
our business and customers.

We may access information from third parties 
such as credit reference agencies to get up 
to date contact details where we need these 
to recover money owed to us. If you are ever 
concerned about paying your debts, please
contact us
.
We act in our
legitimate interests
as we need 
to recover money owed to us to enable us to operate our business.
We use call recordings to prevent fraud, for staff training and to manage customer complaints.
We act in our
legitimate interests
as call recordings help us to meet our responsibilities to combat fraud, provide good customer service and respond to complaints.
We use algorithms and computer programs to analyse customer data by creating customer segments and scoring. We use customer data from our products, and data from declined applications. We sometimes combine your data with data from our partners to help us in our analysis. This will only happen where those partners have ensured that passing your personal data to us is permitted by data protection laws – this means that they must ensure that you have been informed that your data will be used in this way. When we analyse data as part of our product development, we don’t use it to identify individual customers.
Analysing customer data allows us to understand our customers better and explore possibilities for how we might serve our customers better and improve our products.
We work together closely with our partner Tesco to make sure we serve our customers a little better each day. To help us do this, some information about you may be shared between us and Tesco. This customer insight and analysis is done to help improve our customer understanding, and won’t negatively affect you.
We act in our
legitimate interests
as these activities allow us to improve our products and serve our customers better.
We use customer data when carrying out internal audits and in financial analysis.
We act in our

To personalise the marketing messages you receive so they are more relevant and interesting. This may include an analysis of your transactions so we can understand what may be of most relevance and interesting to you.
We may also get information from third parties to tailor our marketing to you.
We will stop using your personal data for these purposes if you ask us to stop sending all marketing messages to you, whether by post, email, telephone, text message, online or through our mobile banking app.
We will work closely together with our partner Tesco to make sure we serve our customers a little better each day. As a part of this, some information about you may be shared with Tesco for marketing activities. You'll only receive marketing that's relevant to your Tesco Clubcard, and your marketing preferences for Tesco and Tesco Bank will be applied.
We use personal data to tailor the adverts we show to you online on social media sites and other sites that sell advertising space. Personalised adverts show the

We work closely with our partner Tesco to use Clubcard data (including shopping habits and the types of purchases you or your household make) to try to bring you better terms, deals, offers or support than you would get if we didn't use the data. This is done by creating customer segments and scores based on factors such as how likely we think you are to pay back money we lend you, how often you use other Tesco products and services, and how you prefer to shop. We can then use these scores as one of the factors in our automated decision-making process. We also consider whether you are a Tesco Clubcard customer or have an existing Tesco Bank product.
Clubcard is a loyalty scheme, and customers trust Tesco to use their Clubcard data to reward them with offers. Clubcard data is only used to give better prices or offers and never to increase prices or decline an application.
Working with our partner Tesco, we use data that you provide, such as your name and address, to find any Tesco Clubcards that are linked to your surname and address. That might be your Tesco Clubcard, or that of a family member living in the same house as you. When we do this, we aim to use the Tesco Clubcard linked to your address which gives you the best terms, deals or offers.
This is in our
legitimate interests
as it allows us to offer better deals to our customers.
We process your data if we need to manage complaints, data subject access requests or legal claims. We also sometimes receive 
requests from regulators for information which might require us to process and share your data with regulators.
When we do this, it is because we are
bringing or defending legal claims
, or because
the law requires us to do this
, as we have regulatory responsibilities to manage complaints to support our customers and respond to data subject rights requests and regulatory requests for information.
Sometimes we ask for sensitive or special category personal data, such as medical information, to allow us to help vulnerable 
customers. We only collect the minimum amount of information required.
Where possible, we will ask for your
consent
to use this data. Where we have asked for your
consent
, you can change your mind at any time by contacting us and asking us to stop processing this information.
Where it is not possible to get your
consent
(for example if you are not able to give
consent
), we will only use or share your information where we believe that it is in your best interests and there are
substantial 
public interests
in us helping our customers in this way.
We are also
required by law
to collect some sensitive data to help our customers as we have responsibilities to support our vulnerable customers.
Biometric data is data which relates to physical or behavioural characteristics used to try to identify a person, for example facial recognition or fingerprint verification.
We use biometric data where this helps us to meet our responsibilities to prevent or detect financial crime. For example, we use algorithms and computer programs to look at images to assess certain features to identify the individual in the image as part of some of our application processes.
Where possible, we will ask for your
consent
to use this data and offer an alternative way of carrying out our checks. If we have asked for your
consent
, you can change your mind at any time by contacting us.
Where the use of biometric data forms an integral part of our financial crime and security checks which we must have in place to meet our regulatory responsibilities, we won’t offer a choice if there are
substantial public interests
in the use of biometrics and it is in our
legitimate interests
. We will explain on product applications or other screens if you have a choice as to the use of biometric data for that product or service.
When you shop online, you will occasionally be asked to authenticate your payment. If you don’t currently use our Mobile App to do this, we will use behavioural biometrics to help confirm it’s you making the payment. Within the payments (authentication) screen we will collect behavioural biometrics data. This looks at various behaviours such as how you move your mouse and keystroke analysis e.g. how you type and the speed at which you type. A profile is built up over time that enables us to identify you and provides a stronger way of checking it is you making the payment online.
Behavioural biometrics for card payments online is performed in the
substantial public interest
as it provides protection from social engineering (fraudsters tricking customers into giving their security details to them). Whilst passwords can be stolen from customers by fraudsters, the unique ways you interact with your devices cannot be duplicated. As our legal basis is
substantial public interest
to prevent and detect unlawful acts (in this case, fraud), you cannot opt out of this use as it is in place to protect you.
If you enable location services within our app, we will collect data which is used in our assessment of whether a transaction is unusual and may be fraudulent. We use algorithms and computer programs to make these assessments. This is done for your security and may be shared with fraud prevention agencies. We also collect location data for analysis purposes to help us to improve our service.
We ask for your
consent
. If you don’t want us to collect and use your location data, you can turn off the location service within our app. You can control access to location services at any time through your phone settings.
We also collect and use your location data to prevent and detect fraud in behavioural biometrics, which is performed in the substantial public interest, as set out above in the table.
We like to hear your views to help us improve our services, so we may contact you for market research purposes. You will always 
have the choice about whether to take part in market research.
This is in our
legitimate interests
as market research helps us to improve our services to customers.
If you request that your data is transferred to a third-party payment initiation or account information service, we will share your information as requested by you. The third party will be responsible for your information once we have transferred it to them and we recommend that you check the privacy policy of the third party before asking for your information to be transferred to them.
The law requires us to do this.
If a person or organisation pays you money by mistake, we will contact you to ask you to return the money. If you do not return the money, the law says we must give your name and address to the account providers of the person or organisation who sent you the money so they can recover the money from you.
When someone pays money into your account, we share your name with them if we need to confirm the payment is being made to the right account.
The law requires us to do this.
If you buy something online or over the phone, this is known as a Card Not Present transaction (CNP) which requires additional authentication for security reasons.
If you make a CNP payment to someone else and we are your card issuer, the organisation you are making the payment to will send us some of your information so we can confirm it is you making the payment.
Similarly, if you are making a CNP payment to us, we share some of your information with your card issuer so they can confirm that it is you making the payment.
This is in our
legitimate interests
as it enables us to detect and prevent fraud, for example, if your card was stolen and a fraudster tried to buy something using incorrect details about you.
In order to provide our products to you, we have to share some of your data with partners we work with. Whenever we share data, we only share the minimum amount necessary to operate our business and provide our products. We may sometimes anonymise or aggregate your data to provide insights to third parties, including Tesco.
In some cases, we need to share your data with our partners because they provide a service which we do not provide. In other cases, we have to share your data to prevent fraud and financial crime or to ensure that we are lending responsibly.
We share the personal data we collect with
Tesco
for customer services across Tesco. For example, we share some personal data with Tesco Stores in connection with the operation of Tesco Clubcard accounts so that Tesco Bank customers receive Tesco Clubcard points where these are collected as part of the Tesco Bank product. We don’t share all of your data with Tesco and only share the minimum amount of data they need to provide or receive shared services.
Summary of data sharing
We share data with:
Our service providers and product partners to allow them to provide their services to you and us (including those who provide funding, debt management, administration, fraud and financial crime detection and professional services)

If you have a credit card with us and you also request a quote for insurance products from Tesco's insurance business (Tesco Personal Finance plc), we may share limited information regarding how you use your credit card with Tesco's insurance business. They may use this information to match this to personal information they already hold about you, so that they can offer you better discounts on insurance products.
We are owned by Barclays PLC, so we work closely with other businesses and companies in the Barclays Group of companies. We may share certain information with other Barclays Group companies (for example, to provide you with products or services, for marketing purposes, for internal reporting and where those companies provide services to us).
Sharing data with Visa and Mastercard
We share card details with Visa and Mastercard to enable them to provide their services to you. If you get a replacement Visa card or Mastercard, they will share the new card details with retailers you have a known relationship with, so that the retailers can keep your card details up to date. This might happen where you have given a retailer permission to hold your card details for future payments. You can opt of out this by contacting the retailer. For Visa card holders, you can call us on
0345 835 3353
to let us know. However, this means you’ll need to contact any retailer you’ve set up a recurring payment with and update your new card details with them directly to ensure your payments continue and your service with them is uninterrupted.
Transferring data overseas
Sometimes we may need to send your personal data to another country. For example, if one of our service providers has a data centre overseas. Before sending your personal data to an overseas country outside the UK or the European Economic Area, we check that the organisation we are sending the data to will be able to keep your data secure. If necessary, we will put appropriate measures in place, such as relevant clauses in contracts, to make sure that personal data is sent and received in line with any laws that apply.
When your personal data is in another country, it could be accessed by law enforcement agencies in those countries. They do this to detect and prevent crime, or because the law says they must.
In most cases we keep your personal data for 7 years after the end of your relationship with us. We keep data in case of legal claims, complaints and for analysis to help us develop our products. For example, looking at customer data helps us to understand how to make lending decisions in future. When we use data for analysis, we do not use it to identify individual customers.
We keep banking application data for up to 7 years after the end of your relationship with us. We do this to develop our products and to protect you and us against fraud and financial crime. We use this data if you apply for a product again in the future, for example as part of our fraud checks.
We keep marketing records for 3 years after your last activity with us.
In some cases, we keep personal data for longer than 7 years, for example where it is needed for an ongoing investigation or legal proceedings. We only keep the data that we need, and we delete or anonymise it as soon as we can.
What credit decisioning is, and how it works
When someone borrows money from a bank, there is always a risk that they may not be able to pay it back. Credit decisioning, which involves credit scoring and checking if you are able to afford the lending, is a way of working out how likely we think it is that you will pay back the money we lend you. Your credit score, which is part of your assessment, is worked out automatically by a computer. It takes into account different factors, such as the amount of debt you currently have, how you have paid off debts in the past and data from your Clubcard if it can be used to improve your credit score. Credit decisioning and credit scoring are important steps in making sure we are lending responsibly.
We use three main sources of data when working out your credit score:
The personal data you give us in your application
The personal data you give us in your application
Data we get from third parties, such as credit reference agencies
Data we get from third parties, such as credit reference agencies
Data we already know about you in connection with other Tesco products, including Clubcard transactions. Clubcard transactions are only used to improve your score.
Data we already know about you in connection with other Tesco products, including Clubcard transactions. Clubcard transactions are only used to improve your score.
When we carry out credit checks
When we are processing your application for a credit product (a loan or credit card), we will perform a credit check with credit reference agencies. You will be told when this is about to happen and will be asked to agree. We will give your personal data to the credit reference agencies and they will give us data about you. This will include data from your application about your financial situation and financial history.
We don’t share data on other products, such as savings accounts, with credit reference agencies, but we access data from credit reference agencies to perform identity checks.
Credit reference agencies will give us data that is public, such as information from the electoral register, as well as specific information they know, such as shared credit, financial situation and financial history information, and fraud prevention information which other lenders have shared with them.
What we do with data from credit reference agencies
We use data from credit reference agencies to:
Assess your creditworthiness and whether we think you can afford to take the product

Make sure any offers we make to you are appropriate to your circumstances, including when showing you personalised offers when you log into your online accounts.
If you have a credit product (a loan, credit card or a current account overdraft), we will continue to exchange data about you with credit reference agencies while you have a relationship with us. This includes telling the credit reference agencies how you manage your debts; for example, how you repay your loans, credit card or manage your overdraft. If you do not pay back in full or on time, we will tell the credit reference agencies, and they will record the outstanding debt.  Other organisations will be able to see this information and may take it into account when making decisions about whether to offer you credit.
How credit reference agencies use your data
When we make a search request, the credit reference agencies make a note on your file that Tesco Bank has done a search. Other organisations will be able to see that Tesco Bank made a search of your data.
If you are making a joint application and tell us that you have a spouse or partner or anyone else that you are financially associated with, we will also search their data with the credit reference agencies and link your records together.
Credit reference agencies will also link your records together. Your records will stay linked until either you or the other person requests that the files are no longer linked (this is known as issuing a ‘notice of disassociation’). It is important that anybody you are making a joint application with, or any financial associate you tell us about, understands this before you make an application.
The three main credit reference agencies are TransUnion, Equifax and Experian.
To learn more about what they do, what data they hold, and what your rights are, go to

,

Cifas and other fraud prevention agencies
The personal information we have collected from you will be shared with fraud prevention agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money laundering and to verify your identity. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance or employment. Further details of how your information will be used by us and these fraud prevention agencies, and your data protection rights, can be found at
www.cifas.org.uk/fpn
and
www.nhunter.co.uk/privacy-policy
Third party service providers for identity checks
When you apply for certain products, we may need to verify your identity and we may use services of external service providers to help us verify your identity to protect our customers and help us meet our regulatory responsibilities.

Our Data Protection Officer supports us in answering any questions and acts as a point of escalation.
We’d like the chance to resolve any complaints you have, but you also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (the "ICO") about how we have used your personal data. Their website is
ico.org.uk
You have a number of data subject rights, which you can make at any time. In some cases, these rights have limitations, but we will always respond within one calendar month. If we cannot meet your request, we will explain why. We may get in touch sooner if we need extra information to help us find your personal data, or to verify your identity.
1. Right of access
You have the right to see the personal data we hold about you. This is called a Subject Access Request. If you make a Subject Access Request, we will send you a copy of the personal data that you would like to see. There are a few exceptions where we might not be able to provide the information, such as where it includes personal data about others. Please use the subject access request form to make your request.

2. Right to have inaccurate data corrected
If you believe we hold inaccurate or missing data, please let us know and we will correct it.
3. Right to restrict us using or request erasure of the personal data we hold about you
If you want us to stop or restrict us using your personal data, or you want us to erase it entirely, please let us know. There are times when we may not be able to do this – for example, if the data is related to a contract between us, or if the law says we need to keep your personal data for a certain amount of time.
You can also ask us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes and you can opt out of marketing at any time:
On emails:
by clicking ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ (usually at the bottom of the email).
Online:
Credit cards customers: by logging in to your Tesco Bank Online Banking, selecting your credit card and going to ‘Manage account > Manage your account > Manage marketing and credit limit increase preferences’.

4. Right to data portability
You can ask us to transfer your personal data in an electronic format to you, or to another organisation (for example, another bank or insurer).
5. Right to human intervention in automated decision-making
An automated decision is one that is made by our systems rather than by a person. The benefit of automated decision-making is that we can quickly make key decisions.
We also use automated decision-making:

Automated decision-making helps us to decide things like how likely it is that you will pay back the money we lend. It takes into account factors such as the amount of debt someone has, and how they have paid off debts in the past.
You have the right to:
Express your concerns and object to a decision taken by purely automated means

If you would like us to review a decision we have made about you, such as declining an application, please let us know.
6. Right to object or withdraw consent
You have the right to object to our use of your personal data. If you do, we'll consider your objection to decide if your rights outweigh our interests in using your personal data. In some instances, we will not be able to agree to your request (for example, if we have a legitimate reason for not doing so or the right doesn’t apply to the particular information we hold about you).
We don’t always have to ask for consent to process your personal data, but where we do, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us.
This privacy policy will be reviewed and updated from time to time. We will contact you if there are any important changes which impact how we use your personal data. If we need to give you the opportunity to opt out, we will give you time to do this before we make any changes to the way we use your personal data.
