Principle
of anonymous data use
In principle, our website can be used without providing personal data. The use of individual services and offers (KnowDrugs App for Android, KnowDrugs App for iOS, KnowDrugs Website[in short ‘KnowDrugs Apps’]) on our website and in our apps can entail divergent regulations which in this case are explained separately below. The legal basis for data protection can be found in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
When you access our website or Apps, some information, such as IP address, is transferred. You are also providing information about the end device used (computer, smartphone, tablet etc.), the browser used (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox etc.), time of visit to the website, the so-called referrer and volume of data transferred.
We cannot use this data to identify an individual user. We only use this information to determine how attractive our offers are and to improve their performance or content, if necessary, and make their design even more appealing to you.
Please bear in mind, however, that in the case of a static IP address, personal identification is possible by
RIPE
query in individual cases, although we do not perform this. Nevertheless, this website is accessible for both static and dynamic IP addresses assigned.
Collection and processing of personal data
In the case of use purely for information, i.e. if you do not register or send us information another way, we only collect personal data which your browser transfers to our servers. If you want to view our website, we collect the following data, which we require for technical purposes in order to show you our content and guarantee stability and security (legal basis is a legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
In the context of the balance of interests in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, we have considered and weighed up our interest in website provision and your interest in data protection compliant processing of your personal data. As the data below is technically required for the provision of our service in order to offer you our website and also guarantee stability and security, in
particular
protection against misuse, we have reached the conclusion that, with a state-of-the-art oriented data security guarantee, this data can be processed whereby appropriate consideration will be given to your interest in data protection compliant processing.

We require these access options and information to ensure the technical function of our app and to provide the services offered with the app, in particular to access your camera or your photos for looking up similar-looking pills comparing a photo you send to us with our database and to send you push notifications to inform you about new drug alerts. During the installation procedure or before you use the app for the first time, we request permission to access individual functions and information. We will only access these functions with your approval. You can revoke access rights manually in the settings for each operating system. You can find out how this works in the manufacturer instructions for your mobile OS. However, please note that you can only use the app to a limited extent or you cannot use it at all without the relevant approval.

Analysis of location data
Based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR) we use the ipdata geolocation service which is provided by Ipdata LLC, 2035 Sunset Lake Road Suite B-2, Newark, Delaware 19702, USA. Ipdata LLC determines the users’ approximate location by means of their IP address being transmitted to ipdata LLC. The purpose is to facilitate the technical implementation of our mobile app, to offer app contents in accordance with the users’ location (such as drug alerts and drug counselling organisations) and thereby to provide user-specific information. The users’ IP addresses will be allocated to their approximate location data based on the country of which the IP address originates. KnowDrugs does not store the geolocation data retrieved from ipdata LLC.

Firebase by Google
We use the Firebase service from Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) in order to derive application behavioral analytics. We use that information to see how users interact with our website and app.
Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers
numerous services for developers
. Some Firebase services process personal data. In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called “instance IDs”, which are provided with a time stamp. These “Instance IDs” assigned by Firebase are unique and thus allow the linking of different events or processes. This data does not represent personally identifiable information for us, nor do we make any efforts to personalize it subsequently. We process these aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior, for example by evaluating crash reports.
Currently, we use the following Firebase services for our App:
Google Analytics for Firebase: Google Analytics uses
the data
to provide analytics and attribution information. The precise information collected can vary by the device and environment. You can find more information via this link:
https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039
.
and on
Google’s partner policy
. Google Analytics retains ID-associated data for 60
days,
and retains aggregate reporting and campaign data without automatic
expiration,
unless the Firebase customer changes their retention preference in their Analytics settings or deletes their project
.For
Analytics for Firebase, Google uses not only the “Instance ID” described
above,
but also the advertising ID of the end device. You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device. For Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Reset Ad ID For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > No ad tracking.
The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is § 25 para. 1 TTDSG and for the subsequent processing of personal data Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR.
Firebase Hosting: Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Place of processing: United States –
Privacy Policy
Firebase Dynamic Links: Dynamic Links uses device specs on iOS and Android to open newly-installed apps to a specific page or context. Dynamic Links only stores device specs temporarily, to provide the service.
Firebase Remote Config: Remote Config uses Instance IDs to select configuration values to return to end-user devices. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
The legal basis for the use of this service is Section 25(2)(2) TTDSG in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR.
Firebase Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to transmit push messages or so-called in-app messages (messages that are only displayed within the respective app). A pseudonymized push reference is assigned to the mobile device, which serves as a target for the push messages or in-app messages. The push messages can be deactivated and reactivated at any time in the settings of the mobile device. Firebase Cloud Messaging uses Instance IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase will use this information on our behalf for the above mentioned reasons.
The legal basis for the use of Firebase Cloud Messaging is § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG i.V.m. Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. As a guarantee pursuant of Art. 44ff of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Google has signed the EU standard contractual clauses.

RevenueCat
The KnowDrugs app for Android and iOS uses RevenueCat to facilitate subscriptions (Place of processing: US). RevenueCat is a service used to verify App Store receipts, process subscription purchases, restore previous purchases and sync purchase status between devices signed into your Apple ID (on iOS) or Gmail Address (on Android). RevenueCat provides us with data on when a user first used the app and with information about purchased subscriptions. This information is linked to an anonymous App User ID. No other information (like your IP address, email, etc.) is collected or transmitted. RevenueCat does not have access to any Personal Information. RevenueCats privacy policy can be found here:
https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy
.
Social media fan pages
KnowDrugs maintains so-called fan pages with social media providers like Instagram and Facebook (both: Facebook Inc. Menlo Park, California) in order to communicate with users, interested parties, and users who are active there, and to inform them about our products and services. In doing so, the users’ data can be processed outside of the EU.
The above-mentioned US providers have signed the EU standard contractual clauses and thus guarantee the observance of European data protection laws.
In the opinion of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), we are responsible, together with Facebook, for the processing of your personal data. You can find the decision of the ECJ dated June 5,
2018
here:
http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=202543&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=298398
A Joint Controller Agreement exists with Facebook Inc. pursuant to Art. 26 GDPR, which can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum. Facebook Ireland pledges to assume the main responsibility in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the processing of Insights data and to fulfill all applicable obligations in the context of the GDPR with reference to the processing of Insights data (including, but not limited to Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, Articles 15 to 22 GDPR, and Articles 32 to 34 GDPR). Facebook Ireland will also make available the essential information of this Page Insights Addendum to the affected parties. Please contact Facebook to assume your rights as affected parties. The Data Policy of Facebook can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation
When using the Facebook fan page, the following data will be collected from you for the purpose of user communication and target group advertising:
user interactions (posts, likes, etc.)
Facebook cookies
demographic data (e.g., based on information regarding age, place of residence, language, or gender)
statistical data on user interactions in aggregated form, that is, without the possibility to relate the information to any particular persons (e.g., page activities, page impressions, page previews, likes, recommendations, articles, videos, page subscriptions, incl. source, times of day)
The usage of personal data for advertising purposes is of particular importance for Facebook. We use the statistics function to find out more about visitors to our fan page. The use of the function enables us to adapt our content to the respective target group. In this
way
we also use, for example, the demographic information about the users’ age and location, whereby it is not at all possible for us to relate this information to persons.
In order to provide the social media service in the form of our Facebook fan page and to use the Insight function, Facebook generally saves cookies on the end device of the user. These include session cookies, which are deleted when the browser is closed, and persistent cookies that remain on the end device until they expire or are deleted by the user.
We use the Facebook Insights function for statistical evaluation purposes. In this connection, we receive anonymized data concerning the users of our Facebook fan page. As a result, it is not possible for us to trace them back to your person. For more information, you can refer to the cookie guideline https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/ of Facebook.
The personal data of users are processed on the basis of our justified interest in effectively providing information to users and maintaining communication with the users, as well as for the purposes of statistical evaluation pursuant to Art. 6(I) (f) GDPR.
Transfer of data to third parties
We only pass your personal data on to third parties if:
you have given your explicit consent to this,
forwarding data is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims and there is no reason to assume you have an overriding legitimate interest in your data not being passed on,
in the event that we have a legal obligation to forward data, and
this is legally permissible and required for the performance of the contractual relationship with you.
In the case of data transfer outside the European Union, the high European level of data protection essentially does not exist. It may be the case with a transfer that an EU Commission adequacy decision in accordance with Article 45 (1) (3) GDPR is not currently in place. This means that the EU Commission has not yet positively determined that the country-specific level of data protection corresponds to the level of data protection in the European Union due to the GDPR. If the recipient is located outside the European Union / European Economic Area, we have taken the necessary measures such as signing the EU standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission, and have additionally taken appropriate security precautions.
Potential risks, which cannot be ruled out completely in connection with data transfer, are in particular:
your personal data could be processed over and above the intended purpose.
Moreover, there is a possibility that you may not be able to exercise your rights in relation to data protection, for example, your right of access, to rectification, erasure, or data portability, on a consistent basis and enforce these.
It may also be highly likely that data is processed incorrectly and in quantitative and qualitative terms, the protection of personal data fails to meet the requirements of the GDPR in full.
Your Rights
Information on the rights of data subjects
Each data subject has the right of access in accordance with Article 15 GDPR, the right to rectification in accordance with Article 16 GDPR, the right to erasure in accordance with Article 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing in accordance with Article 18 GDPR, the right to object in Article 21 GDPR and the right to data portability in Article 20 GDPR. The limitations according to Articles 34 and 35 BDSG apply to the right of access and to the right to erasure.
Information on the option to lodge a complaint
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority about our processing of your personal data.
Information on withdrawal of consent
You can withdraw your consent with us to process personal data at any time. This also applies to withdrawals of a declaration of consent that were given to us before the General Data Protection Regulation came into effect, i.e. before May 25, 2018. Please note that this withdrawal will only apply prospectively. This does not affect processing that took place prior to
a withdrawal
.
CCPA Consumer Rights (Additional California Privacy Rights)
This section provides additional details for California consumers about the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA“.
In addition to the rights mentioned above under “information on the rights of data subjects”, California consumers have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised their rights under the CCPA. In particular, Freeletics may not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices for goods or services, either by denying benefits or imposing penalties, provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services or threaten you with any of the above. In addition, Freeletics does not sell the personal information we collect (as defined in the CCPA) and will not sell it without providing you the right to opt out.
Right in the event that data is processed for direct marketing purposes
You have the right pursuant to Article 21 (2) GDPR to object to the processing of personal data concerning you. In the event that you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal data for this purpose. Please note that this withdrawal will only apply prospectively. This does not affect processing that took place prior to
a withdrawal
.
Information on the
right
to object in the case of balance of interests
If we process your personal data based on a balance of interests, you can object to such processing. If you exercise this right to object, please state the reasons why we should not process your data as we have described. If your objection is justified, we will review the situation and either stop or adjust data processing or explain our compelling legitimate reasons for processing to you.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our

rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Google Product Privacy Guide
How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

Functional cookies enhance functions, performance, and services on the website. Some examples include: cookies used to analyze site traffic, cookies used for market research, and cookies used to display advertising that is not directed to a particular individual.
Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant communications, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.
We may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.
Salesforce may also use HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for the above-mentioned purposes. These technologies differ from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store, and how they store it.
We need your prior consent to use functional cookies. To change your cookie settings and preferences, including those for functional cookies, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.

Advertising cookies
Advertising cookies track activity across websites in order to understand a viewer’s interests and to direct marketing to them.
We sometimes use cookies delivered by us or by third parties to show you ads for our products that we think may interest you on devices you use and to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.
Salesforce also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites. Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services by collecting certain data through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use. When we work with third party advertising networks, we require them to restrict their data processing to only what is necessary to provide us with the advertising services we request.
We need your prior consent to use of targeting and advertising cookies. To change your cookie settings and preferences, including those for targeting and advertising cookies, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.

While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators. Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our websites. Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
4.5 Social Media Features
Our websites may use social media features, such as the “Tweet” button and other sharing widgets (“Social Media Features”). Social Media Features may allow you to post information about your activities on our website to outside platforms and social networks. Social Media Features may also allow you to like or highlight information we have posted on our website or our branded social media pages. Social Media Features are either hosted by each respective platform or hosted directly on our website. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our websites. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.
Salesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our websites using sign-in services. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data from these services with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
Your interactions with Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.

The use of individual services and offers (KnowDrugs App for Android, KnowDrugs App for iOS, KnowDrugs Website[in short ‘KnowDrugs Apps’]) on our website and in our apps can entail divergent regulations which in this case are explained separately below. The legal basis for data protection can be found in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
When you access our website or Apps, some information, such as IP address, is transferred. You are also providing information about the end device used (computer, smartphone, tablet etc.), the browser used (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox etc.), time of visit to the website, the so-called referrer and volume of data transferred.
We cannot use this data to identify an individual user. We only use this information to determine how attractive our offers are and to improve their performance or content, if necessary, and make their design even more appealing to you.
Please bear in mind, however, that in the case of a static IP address, personal identification is possible by
RIPE
query in individual cases, although we do not perform this. Nevertheless, this website is accessible for both static and dynamic IP addresses assigned.
Collection and processing of personal data
In the case of use purely for information, i.e. if you do not register or send us information another way, we only collect personal data which your browser transfers to our servers. If you want to view our website, we collect the following data, which we require for technical purposes in order to show you our content and guarantee stability and security (legal basis is a legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
In the context of the balance of interests in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, we have considered and weighed up our interest in website provision and your interest in data protection compliant processing of your personal data. As the data below is technically required for the provision of our service in order to offer you our website and also guarantee stability and security, in
particular
protection against misuse, we have reached the conclusion that, with a state-of-the-art oriented data security guarantee, this data can be processed whereby appropriate consideration will be given to your interest in data protection compliant processing.

Firebase by Google
We use the Firebase service from Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) in order to derive application behavioral analytics. We use that information to see how users interact with our website and app.
Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers
numerous services for developers
. Some Firebase services process personal data. In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called “instance IDs”, which are provided with a time stamp. These “Instance IDs” assigned by Firebase are unique and thus allow the linking of different events or processes. This data does not represent personally identifiable information for us, nor do we make any efforts to personalize it subsequently. We process these aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior, for example by evaluating crash reports.
Currently, we use the following Firebase services for our App:
Google Analytics for Firebase: Google Analytics uses
the data
to provide analytics and attribution information. The precise information collected can vary by the device and environment. You can find more information via this link:
https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039
.
and on
Google’s partner policy
. Google Analytics retains ID-associated data for 60
days,
and retains aggregate reporting and campaign data without automatic
expiration,
unless the Firebase customer changes their retention preference in their Analytics settings or deletes their project
.For
Analytics for Firebase, Google uses not only the “Instance ID” described
above,
but also the advertising ID of the end device. You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device. For Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Reset Ad ID For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > No ad tracking.
The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is § 25 para. 1 TTDSG and for the subsequent processing of personal data Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR.
Firebase Hosting: Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Place of processing: United States –
Privacy Policy
Firebase Dynamic Links: Dynamic Links uses device specs on iOS and Android to open newly-installed apps to a specific page or context. Dynamic Links only stores device specs temporarily, to provide the service.
Firebase Remote Config: Remote Config uses Instance IDs to select configuration values to return to end-user devices. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
The legal basis for the use of this service is Section 25(2)(2) TTDSG in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR.
Firebase Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to transmit push messages or so-called in-app messages (messages that are only displayed within the respective app). A pseudonymized push reference is assigned to the mobile device, which serves as a target for the push messages or in-app messages. The push messages can be deactivated and reactivated at any time in the settings of the mobile device. Firebase Cloud Messaging uses Instance IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase will use this information on our behalf for the above mentioned reasons.
The legal basis for the use of Firebase Cloud Messaging is § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG i.V.m. Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. As a guarantee pursuant of Art. 44ff of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Google has signed the EU standard contractual clauses.

RevenueCat
The KnowDrugs app for Android and iOS uses RevenueCat to facilitate subscriptions (Place of processing: US). RevenueCat is a service used to verify App Store receipts, process subscription purchases, restore previous purchases and sync purchase status between devices signed into your Apple ID (on iOS) or Gmail Address (on Android). RevenueCat provides us with data on when a user first used the app and with information about purchased subscriptions. This information is linked to an anonymous App User ID. No other information (like your IP address, email, etc.) is collected or transmitted. RevenueCat does not have access to any Personal Information. RevenueCats privacy policy can be found here:
https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy
.
Social media fan pages
KnowDrugs maintains so-called fan pages with social media providers like Instagram and Facebook (both: Facebook Inc. Menlo Park, California) in order to communicate with users, interested parties, and users who are active there, and to inform them about our products and services. In doing so, the users’ data can be processed outside of the EU.
The above-mentioned US providers have signed the EU standard contractual clauses and thus guarantee the observance of European data protection laws.
In the opinion of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), we are responsible, together with Facebook, for the processing of your personal data. You can find the decision of the ECJ dated June 5,
2018
here:
http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=202543&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=298398
A Joint Controller Agreement exists with Facebook Inc. pursuant to Art. 26 GDPR, which can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum. Facebook Ireland pledges to assume the main responsibility in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the processing of Insights data and to fulfill all applicable obligations in the context of the GDPR with reference to the processing of Insights data (including, but not limited to Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, Articles 15 to 22 GDPR, and Articles 32 to 34 GDPR). Facebook Ireland will also make available the essential information of this Page Insights Addendum to the affected parties. Please contact Facebook to assume your rights as affected parties. The Data Policy of Facebook can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation
When using the Facebook fan page, the following data will be collected from you for the purpose of user communication and target group advertising:
user interactions (posts, likes, etc.)
Facebook cookies
demographic data (e.g., based on information regarding age, place of residence, language, or gender)
statistical data on user interactions in aggregated form, that is, without the possibility to relate the information to any particular persons (e.g., page activities, page impressions, page previews, likes, recommendations, articles, videos, page subscriptions, incl. source, times of day)
The usage of personal data for advertising purposes is of particular importance for Facebook. We use the statistics function to find out more about visitors to our fan page. The use of the function enables us to adapt our content to the respective target group. In this
way
we also use, for example, the demographic information about the users’ age and location, whereby it is not at all possible for us to relate this information to persons.
In order to provide the social media service in the form of our Facebook fan page and to use the Insight function, Facebook generally saves cookies on the end device of the user. These include session cookies, which are deleted when the browser is closed, and persistent cookies that remain on the end device until they expire or are deleted by the user.
We use the Facebook Insights function for statistical evaluation purposes. In this connection, we receive anonymized data concerning the users of our Facebook fan page. As a result, it is not possible for us to trace them back to your person. For more information, you can refer to the cookie guideline https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/ of Facebook.
The personal data of users are processed on the basis of our justified interest in effectively providing information to users and maintaining communication with the users, as well as for the purposes of statistical evaluation pursuant to Art. 6(I) (f) GDPR.
Transfer of data to third parties
We only pass your personal data on to third parties if:
you have given your explicit consent to this,
forwarding data is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims and there is no reason to assume you have an overriding legitimate interest in your data not being passed on,
in the event that we have a legal obligation to forward data, and
this is legally permissible and required for the performance of the contractual relationship with you.
In the case of data transfer outside the European Union, the high European level of data protection essentially does not exist. It may be the case with a transfer that an EU Commission adequacy decision in accordance with Article 45 (1) (3) GDPR is not currently in place. This means that the EU Commission has not yet positively determined that the country-specific level of data protection corresponds to the level of data protection in the European Union due to the GDPR. If the recipient is located outside the European Union / European Economic Area, we have taken the necessary measures such as signing the EU standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission, and have additionally taken appropriate security precautions.
Potential risks, which cannot be ruled out completely in connection with data transfer, are in particular:
your personal data could be processed over and above the intended purpose.
Moreover, there is a possibility that you may not be able to exercise your rights in relation to data protection, for example, your right of access, to rectification, erasure, or data portability, on a consistent basis and enforce these.
It may also be highly likely that data is processed incorrectly and in quantitative and qualitative terms, the protection of personal data fails to meet the requirements of the GDPR in full.
Your Rights
Information on the rights of data subjects
Each data subject has the right of access in accordance with Article 15 GDPR, the right to rectification in accordance with Article 16 GDPR, the right to erasure in accordance with Article 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing in accordance with Article 18 GDPR, the right to object in Article 21 GDPR and the right to data portability in Article 20 GDPR. The limitations according to Articles 34 and 35 BDSG apply to the right of access and to the right to erasure.
Information on the option to lodge a complaint
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority about our processing of your personal data.
Information on withdrawal of consent
You can withdraw your consent with us to process personal data at any time. This also applies to withdrawals of a declaration of consent that were given to us before the General Data Protection Regulation came into effect, i.e. before May 25, 2018. Please note that this withdrawal will only apply prospectively. This does not affect processing that took place prior to
a withdrawal
.
CCPA Consumer Rights (Additional California Privacy Rights)
This section provides additional details for California consumers about the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA“.
In addition to the rights mentioned above under “information on the rights of data subjects”, California consumers have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised their rights under the CCPA. In particular, Freeletics may not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices for goods or services, either by denying benefits or imposing penalties, provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services or threaten you with any of the above. In addition, Freeletics does not sell the personal information we collect (as defined in the CCPA) and will not sell it without providing you the right to opt out.
Right in the event that data is processed for direct marketing purposes
You have the right pursuant to Article 21 (2) GDPR to object to the processing of personal data concerning you. In the event that you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal data for this purpose. Please note that this withdrawal will only apply prospectively. This does not affect processing that took place prior to
a withdrawal
.
Information on the
right
to object in the case of balance of interests
If we process your personal data based on a balance of interests, you can object to such processing. If you exercise this right to object, please state the reasons why we should not process your data as we have described.
