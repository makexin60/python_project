Getting the right temperature, over time
Adam Wegener makes and teaches ceramics in Portola Valley, CA. Last year, he bought a Fluke 189 DMM and a high temperature thermocouple from the local ceramics store that allows him to measure temperatures up to 2300°F. Now he uses the 189 to log temperature over the 30-hour heat up and cool down cycle. Then, he loads the temperatures onto his computer and uses the peak temperature and heating rates to perfect his next firing.

How to get great results with an infrared thermometer
Infrared (IR) thermometers enable you to measure temperature quickly, at a distance, and without touching the object you're measuring. They are so useful, easy, and even fun to use that they have become as common in kitchens as they have on factory floors. Infrared thermometers are often used to find overheated equipment and electrical circuits, but they have hundreds of other uses.

Why You Care: Mixed Cabinet Electronics and Power
Mixing higher voltage 480-volt three-phase cables in the same cabinet as lower voltage 24- or 120-volt control wiring and communication cabling can result in erratic operation or even complete failure of electronic equipment inside the cabinet. Knowing what is inside the cabinet before you open it, the specific wiring issues to look for once inside, what values to measure, and simple ways to correct problems can help alleviate many erratic and sometimes "mysterious" control and communication issues on the plant floor.

Targeting Safety in Photovoltaic System Installation and Maintenance
Late on a Sunday afternoon the Kern County Fire Department responded to a call at a store on Rosedale Highway in Bakersfield, California. Crews found that a row of solar panels on the roof had caught fire. Some of the panels were still live when the crew arrived, so the fire crew had to take extra precautions until electrical power could be disconnected.

Case study: Texas power consultant keeps uninterruptible power supplies up and running
Critical systems run smoothly with regular maintenance and reliable tools Everybody knows that consistent, dependable electrical power is critical to any plant's function. But perhaps even more critical is a reliable uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system. UPS systems are the silent partners that just sit and wait until there's a break in power. At that point, the UPS system is the most important system in the plant. It has to be ready to spring into action in milliseconds to keeps things running for anywhere from seconds to hours.

Reliable backup power
Since information technology (IT) installations are particularly sensitive to power supply fluctuations and distortions, they typically rely on an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to compensate. Some installations even include a second UPS supplied by a separate feeder, and a standby generator that can be set to start automatically three minutes after detecting a power interruption.

Considering cogeneration?
Cogeneration - also known as combined heat and power or CHP - is the process of generating electricity and usable heat at the same time. The term has a modern, "green energy" ring to it, but cogeneration has been around since Edison's Pearl Street Station used heat from its turbines to warm the buildings of lower Manhattan in the 1880s.

Find industrial energy waste
With energy savings, there's intent and then there's plan. Industrial facilities in the United States show a sustained interest in energy management. That's the intent: Reduce overall energy usage or sustain usage but increase the amount produced per kW used.In manufacturing, a plan will only stick if it has both the wisdom of experience guiding the vision and the ROI numbers to back up the effort. But in energy, there just isn't the body of research out there for an industrial plant manager to use to set baselines for what "reasonable" energy usage looks like in a manufacturing facility.

Diagnosing mold problems
One of the possible problems in facilities today is the presence and effects of mold on the indoor environment. Molds are normally present in nature. They reproduce by means of tiny spores that float through the air and are invisible to the naked eye. They can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation - but none of the many types of mold will grow without water or moisture. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth will often occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains unaddressed.

Insulation resistance and electrical testing for HVAC compressor motors
HVACR mechanics rarely rely on a single test to pass or fail a function or process. As they walk up to a condensing unit, they listen, they wave their hand over the condenser discharge air, and then they grab the suction line, the liquid line, and the discharge line (and wish they hadn't done that). All of this before they even open their tool box.

With just operational changes or different maintenance practices, they can find savings to strengthen the bottom line, reinvest for even greater savings, or both.

Understanding capacitive voltage sensors
The capacitive voltage sensor works because when you hold the barrel in your hand and place the tip near a live conductor, you are inserting the high impedance sensing element into a capacitively coupled series circuit. As your hand and body form a relatively large capacitor coupled to the floor. The sensor tip is a small capacitor coupled to the live voltage. The sensing circuit detects the voltage and turns on a light or sounds the buzzer.

Clamp meter readings: problems and solutions
Since a small increase in current flow to a motor produces a proportionately larger amount of heat, motor amperage exceeding nameplate values should be carefully investigated as a possible cause. These overload trips, though often caused by motor loading issues, can also indicate bearing failure, insulation breakdown or voltage unbalance.

Determining Load Horsepower, Wiring, and Breaker Size for Safe and Efficient Installations
“Let's just oversize the motor and we can run it lightly loaded—that will save us some money and be easier on the motor.” This is a false belief among some who select and install motors. Properly sizing motors for a given load results in driving loads more efficiently, saving energy, and saving dollars. Motors typically are most efficient when they are 90 % to 95 % loaded. Just because a motor says “25 Hp” on the nameplate does not mean the motor is producing twenty-five horsepower as it operates.Clamp meter readings: Problems and Solutions
