9. Revoking consent & limiting access
Direct marketing
If you do not want your data to be used for direct marketing activities, you can let us know via the bunq app anytime. Additionally, our communication via email also always contains the possibility to unsubscribe from these messages.
GPS and access to your contact list
While using the bunq app, you can provide permission to your contact list and to process location data (for the card protection function). If you no longer want us to use location data, or if you no longer want to provide access to your contact list in the bunq app, you can easily revoke these permissions by going to Settings in your bunq app. You will find the settings for the bunq app at the settings for installed apps on your device.

Phone number, email aliases and Easy Elite Plan
At signup we connect your phone number and email address to your bunq account as aliases. This allows other bunq users to easily and safely transfer money to your bank account(s), as your bunq account (and IBAN) will show up in their contact list if they have added you to their phone contact list with your phone number and/or email address. The processing of your aliases for these purposes is based upon bunq’s legitimate interest since this feature makes banking easier and helps to prevent fraud and misuse. Furthermore, it gives bunq users certainty that money is transferred into the correct account. You can easily disconnect aliases from your bank account(s) and thereby opt-out from the processing of your aliases for these purposes via the settings of the selected bank account.
We will also show other bunq users on Together and in the app that you are on an Easy ElitePlan. You can turn this feature off in the settings section of your account.

Interest
2.2 We may also automatically collect certain information from your device. More specifically, the information we automatically collect may include information concerning your IP address, device type, unique identification numbers, browser type, broad geographic location (for example, country-wide or city-wide), advertising identifier and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device interacted with our Application (screens displayed or clicks on the Application or on the website). The collection of this information makes it possible to track how the Application is used and to identify/correct any bugs. When cross-referenced with other sources, this collection also allows us to understand who its users are (where they are, their age, gender, language, etc.) and thus determine how to develop the Application and advertising content that may be of interest to them.
We use this information for internal analysis purposes, as well as to improve the quality and relevance of our Application for our visitors.
Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies, as further explained in our Cookies Policy which is available
here
.
Version 8 of the tricount will contain no general or personalized advertising content and no personal data will be collected for these purposes in this version of the app.
2.3 From time to time, we may receive Personal Data concerning you from third party sources (including integrated services for processing refunds), but only where we have verified that such third parties have your consent or are legally authorized or required to disclose your Personal Information to us.
The type of Personal Data we collect from third parties include confirmations of payments made and we use the Personal Information we receive from these third parties to ensure the accuracy of the information we hold concerning you.
2.4 In general, we will only use the Personal Data we collect from you for the purposes described in this Policy or for those that we will explain to you when collecting the Personal Data. However, we may also use your Personal Data for other purposes which are not incompatible with the purposes we have communicated to you (such as processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes) and provided that they are permitted by applicable data protection law.
3. Who do we share your Personal Data with?
3.1 We may transmit your Personal Data to the following categories of recipients:
to our group companies for purposes consistent with this Notice. We take precautions to allow access to Personal Data only to those staff members who have a legitimate business need for access and with a contractual prohibition of using the Personal Data for any other purpose.
to our third party suppliers, service providers and partners who provide us with a data processing service, or who process Personal Data for the purposes described in this Policy, or who are notified to you when collecting your Personal Data. This may include communications to third party suppliers and other service providers we use in connection with the services they provide to us, including to support us in areas such as IT platform management or support services, infrastructure or application services, marketing and data analysis;
to any relevant law enforcement agency, regulator, government agency, court or other third party when we believe that disclosure is necessary (i) under applicable laws or regulations, (ii) to establish or defend our rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.
to our auditors, advisors, legal representatives and similar agents in connection with the advisory services they provide to us for legitimate business purposes and subject to a contractual prohibition on using the Personal Data for other purposes;
to a potential purchaser/investor/lender (and its agents and advisors), in connection with a proposed capital raising, purchase, merger or acquisition of a portion of our business, provided that we inform the buyer that they must only use your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Policy;
to any other person as long as you have given your prior consent to the disclosure.
4. How we protect your privacy
4.1 In accordance with this Policy, we will process Personal Data as follows:
Loyalty: We will process Personal Data fairly. This means that we are transparent about how we process Personal Data and will process it in accordance with applicable law.
Purpose limitation: We will process Personal Data for specified and lawful purposes and will not process it in a manner that is inconsistent with those purposes.
Proportionality: We will process Personal Data in a manner proportionate to the purposes for which the processing is intended.
Accuracy of data: We take appropriate measures to ensure that the Personal Data we hold is accurate, complete and, if necessary, kept up to date. However, it is also your responsibility to ensure that your Personal Data is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as possible by promptly notifying tricount of any changes or errors.
Data security: We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data that we collect and process concerning you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data. We have, directly or indirectly through our service providers, use of the following security measures: securing system access, prevention, detection and action measures against physical hazards (such as fire), backup systems, network security, logical access protection, list of authorized personnel and authentication system.
Data processors: We may engage third parties to process Personal Data. for and on behalf of tricount. We require these data processors to process the Personal Data and act strictly in accordance with our instructions and to take appropriate measures to ensure that Personal Data remains protected.
International data transfers: Your Personal Data may be transferred and processed in countries other than the country in which you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your own country (and in some cases may not be as protective).
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to demand that your Personal Data remain protected in accordance with this Policy. They include the implementation of a data transfer agreement based on the Standard Contractual Clauses of the European Commission for the transfer of Personal Data with the third parties we engage to provide our services, which require all parties involved in the service provided by tricount to protect the Personal Data they process from the EEA in compliance with European Union data protection law.
Our data transfer agreement can be provided upon request. We have put in place similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and our partners and other details may be provided upon request.
Data retention: We retain the Personal Data we collect from you for as long as we have a legitimate business need (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we no longer have a legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we delete it or make it anonymous, or if this is not possible (for example, when your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), we store it securely and isolate it from any further processing until such time as deletion is possible.
5. Your data protection rights
5.1 You have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to access, correct or update your Personal Data, you can do so at any time by contacting us via: privacy@tricount.com.
With regard to the deletion of your Personal Data, you can also do this at any time by contacting us via: privacy@tricount.com. Please note that the data of the tricounts themselves (expenses, etc.) will not be deleted in this context. Indeed, since a tricount is an account sheet shared between several users, we must keep this data as it can still benefit other users. When requesting the deletion of your Personal Data, your identifiers within the tricounts in which you participate will be pseudonymised.
In addition, in certain circumstances, you can object to the processing of your Personal Data, ask us to restrict the processing of your Personal Data or request the portability of your Personal Data. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us via: privacy@tricount.com.
If we have collected and processed your Personal Data with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legality of any processing we have carried out prior to such withdrawal and will not affect any processing of your Personal Data carried out on the basis of legal grounds other than consent.
If you have any complaints or concerns about how we process your Personal Data, we will endeavor to address these concerns. If you believe that we have not sufficiently addressed your complaint or concern, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available at
here
.)
5.2 We respond to all requests we receive from data subjects wishing to exercise their rights relating to the protection of their personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection law.
Links to other Websites
The Website and the Applications may contain hyperlinks or buttons redirecting to Websites and/or applications owned and operated by third parties. These Websites/Applications have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to review them. They will govern the use of the Personal Data you submit by visiting these Websites.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third party Websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.
6. Updating this Policy
6.1 We may update this Policy from time to time in response to changes in legal, technical or commercial developments. When we update our Policy, we will take appropriate steps to notify you, given the significance of the changes we will be making. We will obtain your consent to any material changes to this Policy if required by applicable data protection law.
6.2 You can see the date of the last update of this Policy by referring to the date of the "last update" posted at the top of this Policy.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google
to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

We collect and analyze IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
We analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
We process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
To meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Examples of processing activities:
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process.
Legal obligations sometimes require us to retain certain information for purposes like financial record-keeping, such as information about a payment you’ve made to Google for tax or accounting purposes.
Various laws and regulations require us to put in place measures to confirm that our users are old enough to use our services. To help determine your age, we process the date of birth you provide. We also process information about your activity in our services, both when you’re signed in to a Google Account or signed out, and use machine learning technology to determine if you are likely over 18. In certain cases, if we cannot confirm that you are old enough to use our services by other means, we can request other information to verify your age, like your government ID, credit card, a photo of you, or your phone number.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).
Google Dashboard
allows you to manage information associated with specific products.
Personal information that you provide us when you create a Google Account (like your
name
and password,
phone number
, date of birth, or
payment information
).
Information that we collect as you use our services
:
Information about your apps, browsers & devices
, such as
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using; and information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, (like IP address, crash reports, and system activity).
Information about your activity in our services
, such as your search terms, Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account, your views and interactions with content and ads, and your activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services. You can review and control activity data stored in your Google Account in
My Activity
.
Location information
, such as may be determined by GPS, IP address, and other data from sensors on or around your device, depending in part on your device and account settings.
Information from publicly accessible sources
, such as information that’s publicly available online (like if your name appears in a local newspaper article) or from other public sources.
Information from our trusted partners
, such as from directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, or security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.
The legal grounds for processing this information will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
When necessary for our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties, including to:
Enforce legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service.
For example, analyzing content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services.
For example, collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public, including disclosing information to government authorities.
For example, responding to legal process or enforceable requests from governments and courts to disclose data, after carefully reviewing each request to make sure it satisfies applicable laws.
Perform research that improves our services for our users and benefits the public.
For example, processing information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
When necessary to protect the
vital interests
of you or another person. For example, processing data to detect and combat online child sexual abuse.
When we have a
legal obligation
to do so, such as retaining certain information for purposes like financial record-keeping, or processing and retaining information to help ensure that users are old enough to use our services.

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more

For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about

Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

We will only process your personal data if we have a legal basis for doing so. The legal basis on which we rely depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Generally, we rely on the following legal bases:
Contractual Necessity:
We process your personal data as a matter of “contractual necessity,” meaning that we need to process the data to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you with the Services through our Customers’ applications and/or websites. When we process personal data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such personal data.

Providing, customizing and improving the Services;
Corresponding with you;
Promoting our Services; and
Maintaining the security of our Services.
We may have other legitimate interests and if applicable, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
Consent:
In some cases, we process personal data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such personal data. When we process personal data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.
Legal Obligation:
From time to time we may also need to process personal data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
European data subject rights
European residents have certain rights with respect to your personal data, including those set forth below. For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email us at
dataprotection@incode.com

Access:
You can request more information about the personal data we hold about you and request a copy of such personal data.
Portability:
You can ask for a copy of your personal data in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.

Erasure:
You can request that we erase some or all of your personal data from our systems.
Restriction of Processing:
You can ask us to restrict further processing of your personal data.
Objection:
You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your personal data for certain purposes, such as for direct marketing purposes.
Withdrawal of Consent:
If we are processing your personal data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such personal data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, it will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

We take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable data protection laws. If you are located in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, these safeguards include transferring your personal data to a country that applicable authorities have determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal data, or by implementing the Standard Contractual Clauses with our Customers, service providers and partners.

15. Additional information for Australian residents
If you reside in Australia or are using our services or interacting with Incode in Australia, the following applies to you. This section supplements, supersedes and extends the scope of this Privacy Notice generally. The remaining sections of this Privacy Notice, other than those sections which are expressly limited to foreign jurisdictions outside of Australia or are inconsistent with the specifics of this section, also apply to you and you should consider this Privacy Notice in full for full details of how we manage your personal data, including the kinds of personal data we collect, how we collect your personal data and the purposes for which your personal data is collected, held, used and disclosed.
A. Are we a data controller or data processor?
Some privacy regimes that we are subject to distinguish how we may collect, use and disclose your personal data depending on whether we are classified as a “data processor” or “data controller.” Under these regimes, we act as a processor when providing identity verification services to our Customers. The “data processor” and “data controller” distinction is not relevant to you to the extent Australian privacy law applies and we have obligations to you with respect the personal data we hold about you, even when acting as a “data processor.” The “data processor” section below explains how we collect and process personal data as data processors on behalf of our Customers in the course of providing our Services. However, these practices are dependent on, and connected with, the data collection and use practices of our Customers.
B. Information we collect as a Data Processor
In certain instances where you use the Incode Omni, we are acting as a data processor on behalf of our Customers for the purposes of certain applicable privacy laws. In these circumstances, there is no difference in the manner of how we collect your personal data, the type of personal data collected or the third parties to whom we may disclose personal data collected to. You should refer to the sections titled “What personal data does Incode collect and why does Incode collect it?” and “How does Incode disclose personal data?” for information regarding what personal data we collect and how we collect and disclose personal data, respectively, when acting as data processors on behalf of our Customers.
The purpose for which we collect your personal data when using Incode Omni remains to verify your identity, authenticate your information and prevent fraud when you use our Customers’ websites or mobile applications. When we act as data processors, exactly how and to what extent Incode Omni is applied or operated may be subject to our Customer’s instructions or control. When acting as a data processor, the personal data that you input into Incode Omni may also be collected by, or held at the direction of, our Customers. Our Customers will use and disclose such personal data in accordance with their own privacy practices and obligations and in accordance with applicable law. We invite you to contact or refer to the relevant Customer if you need any further information regarding the privacy practices of our Customers.
While your use of Incode Omni is always voluntary and subject to your consent, we note that our Customers may be required by law to verify your identity to certain prescribed standards prior to offering services to you. For further information regarding your personal data in those cases beyond the details herein included regarding Incode’s activity, we invite you to contact the relevant company or organization if you have any questions about their privacy practices. In all other cases, we act as a data controller of your personal data for the purposes of applicable privacy law.
C. Your rights under Australian privacy law
You are entitled to access the personal data we hold about you and may request that we correct any errors in the personal data we hold. If you would like to access or correct your personal data held by us, please contact us at:
dataprotection@incode.com
Australia Square
Level 33, 264 George Street
Sydney, NSW 2000.
We will take reasonable steps to allow you to access your personal data unless reasonable circumstances exist that would prohibit us from doing so.
We will correct your personal data where we are satisfied that the personal data is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. If we correct any personal data that we have disclosed to third parties we will take reasonable steps to notify those parties of the change or update. You accept that, following a request to correct your personal data, we may be required to take reasonable steps to verify your identity or the personal data, which may include confirmation with third parties.
If you are concerned that we may have breached the Australian Privacy Principles, please contact us immediately at the contact details set out above. We will undertake a reasonable and expeditious assessment of the concern and suggest relevant resolution processes. This process will be completed as soon as practicable and in any event within 30 days. If you are unsatisfied with our response to, or resolution of, your complaint you may choose to contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at their website
www.oaic.gov.au.
D. Direct marketing in Australia

Unless you exercise your right to opt-out of such communication, you will be taken to have consented to receive similar information and communications in the future.

to enforce Craft’s Terms of Service; and
as otherwise set forth in this Privacy and Security Policy.
Craft may make anonymous or aggregate personal information available, and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner, to:
Users of the Service for purposes of comparison to the broader community;
Organizations approved by Craft that conduct research into career management and development; and

If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@craft.co.
‍
2. Online session information and use is only used to improve your experience.

If you choose to eliminate cookies, the full functionality of the Site or Service may be impaired for you.
‍
‍
3. Third Parties.
We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us analyze visitor activity on the Site. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for Craft. We do not share any personal data about our customers with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect such information on our behalf. These services include:

Some parts of our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button, and widgets, such as the “share this” button. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Service. When you use these tools, the party that provides the tool, the third party that operates the social media services, and/or we may receive information about you. By using these tools or by communicating with us through social media services, you acknowledge that some information, including personal information, from your social media services will be transmitted to us, and that information is therefore is covered by this Privacy and Security Policy, and some information, including personal information, may be shared with the third party services, and that information is therefore governed by their privacy policies.

If you choose to create a Service account through one of your SNS Accounts, you may have to provide us with your username (or user ID) so that your identity can be authenticated by the SNS Account. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be able to link your account with the SNS Account. That linking may allow us to access certain personal data, such as your name and email address, your user ID for the SNS Account, data tokens used to implement single sign-on and connect with your SNS Account profile, and other personal data that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access, in connection with creating your Service account. We don’t receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.

‍
4. Disclosure of your information.
Craft may disclose your personal information:
to third-party contractors that provide services (e.g. email notifications or hosting services) to Craft and are bound by these same privacy restrictions;
to the third-party analytics providers identified in Section 3, although in this case we will disclose only information your browser automatically provides, not personally identifiable information like your name, email address, or similar contact information;
or to an acquirer as indicated in Section 5.
Craft also reserves the right (and you authorize Craft) to share or disclose your personal information when Craft determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of such information is necessary or appropriate:
To enforce our rights against you or in connection with a breach by you of this Privacy and Security Policy or the Craft.co Terms of Use;
To prevent prohibited or illegal activities; or
When required by any applicable law, rule regulation, subpoena or other lawful request of public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
When we disclose personal information for these purposes, we can’t necessarily predict who the recipients may be, but could include law enforcement agencies, national security agencies, our lawyers, and courts.
‍
5. Your data may be transferred upon change of control but only in accordance with this Policy.
Personal information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other change of control. If we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will be asked if you’d like to stop receiving promotional information following any change of control.
‍
6. You can delete your data.
When you request us to delete your account for the Service, your data will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. We will also promptly disconnect any connection we had established to your Account Information and delete all account credentials. However, portions of your data, consisting of aggregate data derived from your Account Information, may remain on our production servers indefinitely. Your data may also remain on a backup server or media. Craft keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers. We also reserve the right to use any aggregated or anonymous data derived from or incorporating your personal information.
7. We use reasonable efforts to secure your data.
We use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Craft.co accounts and systems from unauthorized access.
When you register for the Service, Craft requires a password or SNS Account user ID and data token from you for your privacy and security. Craft transmits information such as your Registration Information for Craft.co or Account Credentials securely.
Our databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. We encrypt your Service password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us. All backup drives and tapes also are encrypted.
8. Our service promotes secure communications with encryption.
From the time you submit your Login ID and Password or your SNS Account user ID and data token, these communications between your computer and Craft.co are encrypted. This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery.
9. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login ID and Password.
We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password. Your password must be at least 6 characters in length. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Login ID and Password. You may not provide these credentials to any third party. If you believe that they have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately at privacy@craft.co and you should change your password immediately via the Service. We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account through Registration Information they have obtained from you or through a violation by you of this Privacy and Security Policy or the Craft.co Terms of Use.
If you have a security related concern, please contact us at privacy@craft.co. We will work closely with you to ensure a rapid and personal response to your concerns.

Privacy Notice
Please read this notice carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.
Contact Us
details are provided at the end of the notice for feedback or any enquiries you may have. If you want to know more about your rights, or you want to exercise them, please visit our dedicated

This notice applies to viafintech GmbH, a company established in the Federal Republic of Germany, as part of the Paysafe Group, which use different trading names in different territories. The companies that are part of the Paysafe Group can be found at the end of this document. The reference to Paysafe (including “we,” “us” or “our”) includes those companies and all relevant group affiliates.
References to “you” in this notice are to the individual who is accessing or applying to use the Services (as defined below) either on your own account or on behalf of a business. This includes, in relation to a customer or prospective customer of Paysafe, any sole trader and any principals, including the managing and financial directors, any other directors and officers, shareholders, partners and beneficial owners of a customer, as well as any member of staff accessing or using the Services on behalf of a customer. Paysafe is committed to protecting your privacy and will take all appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and will be collected, used, stored, and disclosed in accordance with this notice. This notice (together with our terms of use applying to any specific services you may purchase or use) applies:
• to the website/portal features and services provided to you when you visit our websites, portals, or our payment panels our clients may use on their websites.
• when you apply to use and/or use Paysafe’s products and services (including any loyalty or reward schemes, whether points-based or otherwise (“Loyalty”), as well as when you request changes to the services you are using.
• to your use of software including terminals, mobile and desktop applications provided by Paysafe; and
• to email, other electronic messages including SMS, telephone, web chat, website/portal and other communications between you and Paysafe.
Together these are all referred to in this notice as “Services.”
We collect and process personal and non-personal information relating to you. Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify a single person, either directly or indirectly.
Paysafe also collects non-personal information or may anonymise personal information to make it non-personal. Non-personal information is information that does not enable a specific individual to be identified, either directly or indirectly. Paysafe may collect, create, store, use, and disclose such non-personal information for any reasonable business purpose. For example, Paysafe may use aggregated transactional information for commercial purposes, such as trend analysis and the use of data analytics to obtain learnings and insight around payment transaction patterns and usage.
To the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (or similar identifiers) are clearly defined to be personal information under any local law, and where such local law is applicable to Services, we will manage such identifiers as personal information.
Please note that Paysafe provides services to both individual consumers and businesses and this privacy notice applies to both and should be read and interpreted accordingly.
We collect the following information through the following means:
Information you give us: we receive and store any personal information (including financial information) you provide to us including when you (or your business) enquire for or make an application for the Services; register to use and/or use any Services; upload and/or store information with us using the Services; and when you communicate with us through email, SMS, a website or portal, or the telephone or other electronic means, e.g. in the context of contacting us about your account or transactions. Such information may reference or relate to you or your customers and includes:
• First name and family name, date of birth, age, email address, billing address, username, password, nationality and country of residence, a copy of your identification, such as your driver’s license or passport, your social security number and/or other government identification or registration data.
• Barcode previously generated by us, as well as your viafintech end customer identification number, bank and/or issuer details.
• Information relating to any items purchased, including the location of the purchase, the value, the time, and any feedback that is given in relation to such purchase, including travel-related personal information when you or your customer are transacting for airline tickets or other travel related services.
• Information about your use of the Services, such as information about how frequently you transact with us, your average transaction volume, account balances, and the people and merchants to whom you send money and from whom you receive money.
• Any other information that you or your customer provide or is generated in the context of using the Services.
Information we collect about you automatically: Paysafe receives and stores certain information automatically whenever you interact with Paysafe, whether you open an account or undertake a transaction with us; for example, by way of “cookies” or similar technology. We also obtain certain information when your web browser accesses Services or advertisements and other content provided by or on behalf of Paysafe on other web sites, or when clicking on emails. Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors and customers who use and interact with Paysafe, where they come from, and how they use our services. We use this information for our analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our services for our visitors and customers. This information includes:
• Technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer or device to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, equipment type, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system platform, frequency and length of visits, and what links you click on.
• Information about your visit or whether you opened an email, including your geolocation, the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time); products or services you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks and mouse-overs) and methods used to browse away from the site page and any phone number used to call our customer service number.
Information collected through our applications: if you download or use mobile or desktop applications provided by Paysafe, we may receive information about your location and your device or the service you are using (including where a payment transaction takes place). Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example GPS). Our mobile and desktop apps may collect such information from your mobile device or your computer at any time while you download or use our apps, if your device has real-time location data access enabled. Where required, we will always seek to notify you if it is our intent to collect real-time location information and, also where required by law, obtain your consent. We may use such information for regulatory purposes, our own due diligence checks, fraud, and risk management, to better understand transaction patterns and to optimise your experience.
Email and Other Communications: we may receive information about you and your use of Services when we communicate with each other, including when you open messages from us and from the use of electronic identifiers (sometimes known as “device fingerprints”), for example, Internet Protocol addresses or telephone numbers.
Information from Other Sources: we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information, including when you apply to use the Services. For example, we work closely with, and receive information from, third parties like business partners, banks and other financial institutions, merchants, subcontractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, government lists and databases, social media sites (including posting made by or about you or us), credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. Credit reference and fraud prevention agency use is further explained below. We may also review public comments and opinions made on social networking sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) to better understand our customers and our provision and development of Services.
Information about other people: if you give us information about other people, you must have informed them in advance (for example, by giving them this privacy notice) and you must ensure you have the right to do so.
We may use and share the personal information we collect for the following purposes:
• To provide our Services to you and your business, including fulfilling Paysafe’s obligations to you or to financial or other institutions in connection with the Services we provide to you (and / or your business). In this context we record and track details of transactions you (and / or your customers) carry out in relation to the Services; analyse and report on your (and / or your customers’) use of any Loyalty service; facilitate the collection or redemption of any points or other rewards currency in respect of any Loyalty programme; notify you about important changes or developments to our website or our goods and services;
• To improve and develop our business, including without limitation to optimise our websites/portals, products, and services. This may include using information you insert into forms but do not submit to us, for example by using that information to optimise our website(s) and contacting you for customer services purposes in relation to that form. We can also use your personal information to develop and evaluate new products and services including in our secure and controlled test environment, or occasionally in those of our suppliers.
• To manage and enforce our rights, terms of use or any other contracts with you (and/or your business), including to manage any circumstances where transactions, rewards or points are disputed; manage, investigate, and resolve complaints; or recover debt or in relation to your insolvency.
• To manage and mitigate our credit risks and terms of business. If you apply for one of our financial products, we may assess your financial position (and / or of your business), to the extent this is provided for in the applicable terms of use. This credit check will also affect any linked parties such as directors, shareholders, and principals. We can do so by receiving and sharing information from and with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies. This credit check will also affect anyone with whom you have a joint account or similar financial association. If it is a joint application, and such link does not already exist, then one may be created. These links will remain until you file a “notice of disassociation” at the credit reference agencies to the extent that such disassociation is allowable. For your information, the agencies will record our enquiries which may be seen by other companies who make their own credit enquiries; and a “footprint” may be placed on your credit file, whether you are accepted as our customer. If you are a Director, we will seek confirmation from credit reference agencies that the residential address that you provide is the same as that held by the relevant companies’ registry (where applicable). In addition, where you take services from us, we will give information on how you manage your accounts to the credit reference agencies. If you do not repay any monies in full and on time, credit reference agencies will record the outstanding debt and may share this information with other organisations that perform checks like ours. Records remain on file at such agencies for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted, although the retention period may differ across different agencies and territories. If you would like further information on our use of credit reference agencies, please contact us.
• To prevent and/or detect fraud, financial crime, manage risk and to better protect ourselves, our customers, and the integrity of the financial system, it may be necessary to process and disclose sensitive personal information (sometimes known as special category personal data) including biometric data to third parties who help us in managing such risks, including identity verification. This may include software and services we use to verify your identity/age by determining whether a selfie you take matches the photo in your ID.
• During the identification process we may use a facial recognition process to compare your selfie with your uploaded ID document. During this process biometric data is generated by creating a digital map of your face to better compare your ID photo and your selfie picture. This helps to reduce fraud and is therefore in the substantial public interest. But any biometric information generated is immediately deleted following a match. Paysafe itself does not store or retain biometric data because such information is generated using secure third-party anti-fraud systems. If your biometric information is stored, retained, or used directly by Paysafe in any way, you will be notified at the point of collection. If you want to know more about our policies and processes in respect of your biometric data, or indeed our use of any other sensitive or special category personal data, you can reach us at the details provided in the Contact Us section.
• To prevent, detect and prosecute fraud and other crimes and abuses of the financial system, or to assist others in doing so, including non-compliance with any terms of business and which may involve the sharing of any relevant or necessary information we have collected or inferred with third parties for such purposes. Paysafe participates in anti-fraud initiatives, which involve assessing you (and/or your customers) and monitoring your transactions and/or locations, to detect patterns requiring investigations or otherwise profile and assess the likelihood of fraud occurring or non-compliance with our or other’s terms of business. We can do so utilising products and services from third parties. Besides, if you give us false or inaccurate information about you, or we identify or suspect a fraud or a crime, we may pass your information to fraud prevention agencies and organisations and to law enforcement agencies and similar bodies, and we may decide to take legal action against you.
• To contact you about your account, to alert you to potential problems, and to respond to your questions to us.
• To manage risks, such as credit and foreign exchange risks, as well as to prevent or mitigate information security risk.
• To send marketing messages, to provide you with the information on products and services you have requested or we think may be of interest to you; to obtain your views on our goods, services and our website/s; in respect of marketing, market research and similar activities, we may use your personal information for such purposes whether or not you are accepted as a customer or continue to receive Services. If you no longer wish to receive marketing or promotional information from Paysafe, you can always stop it. You can find more information on this in the section on “Your Data Protection Rights.”
• To comply with local and national laws.
• To comply with requests from law enforcement and regulatory authorities on public interest grounds or from commercial organisations with whom you have or have had dealings, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or to protect your vital interests or those of other persons, for example to help those authorities or other organisations in the fight against crime and terrorism; and
• To comply with card scheme rules or any terms of business.
If you provide information to be published or displayed on public areas of the website/portal or transmitted to other users of the website/portal or third parties, you understand that such information can be used by any third parties accessing the information for any purposes. This information is posted by you at your own risk, and you must comply with the terms of use of such site.
We do not disclose information which could identify you personally, to anyone except as described in this notice, as permitted, or required by law, and/or for the purposes described in this notice, including:
• Within the Paysafe Group to help us provide our services and for our own internal customer relationship management, analytical and reporting purposes.
• To recipients/senders of a payment in the context of the specific relevant transaction (information is limited to full name and email address).
• Credit reference agencies (where permitted under any terms of use or other contract) as described above. If you would like further information on how we use credit reference agencies, please contact us.
• Fraud prevention agencies as described above, including Action Fraud, Financial Fraud Action and the Financial Fraud Bureau and other organisations who assist us in managing fraud and business risk.
• Third-Party Credit and Financial Institutions (where allowed under any terms of use or other contract), including the credit institution where the sender or recipient (and their businesses, respectively) maintain their bank account(s) and the card schemes governing the issue and use of credit, debit, charge, purchase or other payment cards, alternative payment schemes and any other financial institutions who may process payments and who are not operating under Paysafe’s control nor for whose actions or omissions Paysafe has liability;
• Where we provide services through third parties such as Banks and other organisations, we may be required to disclose your information (including any ‘know your customer’ and ‘source of wealth’ information) with such organisations to assist their own regulatory obligations or risk assessments.
• Third Party Service Providers, including suppliers who assist us with the provision of Services, including processing orders, fulfilling orders, processing payments, managing credit, security, sector and fraud risk, identity verification, and marketing, market research and survey activities conducted on behalf of Paysafe. Occasionally, we may use the services of third-party providers to assist with the provision of services that might require the use of your personal information, including for the purposes of live data testing and to which suitable security arrangements will be implemented.
• To third parties who do not act under our instructions as a service provider (but will be subject to their own legal obligations to keep data secure), to facilitate provision of the Services. For example, banks and organisations who facilitate the trading of your stocks, crypto currencies, and other financial instruments.
• To prevent and/or detect fraud, financial crime, manage risk and to better protect ourselves and our customers, it may be necessary to process and disclose sensitive personal information (sometimes known as special category personal data) to third parties who help us in managing such risks, including identity verification.
• Where we are required or permitted to do so by law, Paysafe may be required by law to pass information about you to regulatory authorities and law enforcement bodies worldwide, or we may otherwise determine that it is appropriate or necessary to do so. Such disclosures may also include requests from governmental or public authorities, or with commercial organisations with whom you may have had dealings and who are seeking to mitigate fraud or credit risk, or non-compliance with terms of business, or for the purposes of litigation or legal process, national security or where we deem it in the national or public interest or otherwise lawful to do so. Paysafe will not ordinarily challenge the serving of court or similar orders requiring disclosure.
• Business transfers. Paysafe may buy or sell business units or affiliates. In such circumstances, we may transfer or receive customer information as a business asset. Without limiting the foregoing, if our business enters a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners. In these circumstances we will inform the recipient that your information should be treated in accordance with the standards described in this notice; and
• With your permission, your information may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission.
Except as necessary for the performance of its services and as described above/attached, Paysafe does not sell, rent, share or otherwise disclose personal information about its customers to third parties for their own third-party marketing use without meeting any necessary legal obligations (e.g., consent, opt-out, or as otherwise permitted by law).
We may monitor or record telephone calls, emails, web chat or other communications with you for regulatory, security, quality assurance or training purposes. When visiting our offices, CCTV, access control systems and/or other monitoring systems may be in operation for security reasons and for health and safety and office management purposes.
We, our service providers, and other parties with whom we may share your personal information (as described above) may process your personal information in territories that are outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or otherwise outside of the territory in which you reside. It may also be processed by staff (ours or that of our suppliers) operating outside the EEA or the territory in which the personal information was collected. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of orders, the processing of payment details and support services in provision of the Services. These countries may have data protection standards that are different to (and, in some cases, lower than) those of the territory in which you reside.
In these circumstances, we will take appropriate steps to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable data protection laws; including using any appropriate safeguards required by law to ensure that any international data transfers are lawful. Paysafe generally uses “
Model Clauses
” as approved by the European Commission when contracting with third-party data recipients outside the EEA who are receiving data from within the EEA for the purpose of processing personal information transferred outside the EEA.
We have implemented technical, physical, and organisational/administrative measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These measures include:
– Written information security program.
– Appointed a Chief Information Security Officer (‘CISO’) to oversee, implement and enforce the information security programme.
– Appointed a Chief Privacy Officer (‘CPO’) to oversee, implement and enforce the privacy programme.
– Continuous vulnerability assessment and monitoring.
– Having information security risk management policies and procedures in place.
– Having an established incident response plan.
– Access controls on information systems, designed to authenticate users and permit access only to authorised individuals.
– Restricting access to physical locations containing personal information only to authorised individuals.
– Securing all personal information, both in transit and at rest.
– Multifactor authentication for all staff accessing personal information.
– Maintaining audit trails relating to internal and external access to and modifications of personal information.
– Adopted secure development practices for in-house developed applications.
– Performing information security due diligence on third-party service providers.
– Performing security awareness training on a regular basis.
The safety and security of your information is also dependent upon you. If we have given you (or if you have chosen) a password or access code for access to certain parts of our website/portal or mobile applications and similar, you are responsible for keeping this password and/or access code confidential. You must not share your password and/or access code with anyone. You must ensure that there is no unauthorised use of your password and access code. Paysafe will act upon instructions and information received from any person that enters your user id and password and you understand that you are fully responsible for all use and any actions that may take place during the use of your account, unless otherwise mandated by law. You must promptly notify Paysafe of any information you have provided to us which has changed.
The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site, unless you are communicating with us through a secure channel that we have provided. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
In most cases, we are required to retain your data for a period, typically up to 7 years, dependant on your circumstances and the type of data involved. This is known as a retention period. The periods for which we retain your personal information are determined based on the nature and type of information, the Paysafe Service, and the country in which they are provided, as well as any applicable local legal or regulatory provisions. Once your information is no longer needed for a legitimate business purpose or reason, it will be deleted, or we may anonymise or aggregate it with other information to make it unidentifiable.
If you use the Services, we will retain your personal information if necessary to provide you with the services of your choice and any linked legitimate business purpose. That would mean we retain your personal information if you are our customer (or commence such an application) and for a period afterwards. This will also include the use and retention of your personal information when you commence completion of an application for Services, irrespective of whether you complete such application process or are accepted as a customer.
The retention period may also depend on the legal and regulatory requirements of the country where you are located. We will retain personal information as evidence of our dealings with you (including whether there were any or no financial transactions), to manage any queries or disputes, including to defend or initiate any legal claims. For example, we will retain your information for the time allowed by the local laws to start a legal claim (so called “statute of limitation”), or for as long as we are ordered pursuant to on an order from the courts, or by law enforcement agencies or our regulators; or as otherwise required or permitted by law (for example, the retention of KYC /Know Your Customer/ records under anti money laundering regulations or similar).
We can also continue marketing and sending you direct marketing, subject to local laws and where you have not objected to such marketing.
You have many rights that you may be able to exercise in relation to your personal information. These rights may apply under several different regulations, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is applicable to EEA residents, and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) which is applicable to California residents. The rights which may be available to you are:
• Right to be informed (please read this Notice for information on how we process your information. If you have any further questions, please contact us
• Right to access (Data Subject Access Request) – request a copy of the information we hold about you
• Right to erasure – request deletion of your information
• Right to restriction – request we restrict the processing of your information
• Right to rectification – request we rectify certain information we hold about you
• Right to data portability – Request an electronic copy of the information you provided to us
• Right to object – Request we stop processing your personal information
• Right to opt-out of marketing – remove your information from our marketing database
• Right to opt-out of the sale of your data
Please note, depending on the country from where you use Services, not all the above rights will be available to you. Furthermore, we are not obligated to grant your request as we may be required by law, for example, to continue its processing. For instance, we are unable to grant your objection request when it is required by law, or to manage a complaint. Similarly, we are unable to delete your information if you want to continue using our Services, or where such information is necessary to record our contractual dealings; it is required by law (for example, the retention of anti-fraud or “know your customer” identify and verification requirements); or for the purpose of defending or asserting legal rights and legal actions.
When you cease your relationship with us and stop using our services, we are permitted by law to retain your information for a period to evidence our dealings with you. This will be in accordance with our internal retention policies and procedures. For more information on retention of data, please refer to the relevant section within this Notice.
To the extent that GDPR applies, when you give us consent to use your personal information, you can withdraw it any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. For example, you can stop any marketing communication we send you by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the communications you receive, or according to the instructions that we provide every time, but we will continue to send you operational or service messages in relation to your Services.
You always have the right to complain to a data protection authority if you are dissatisfied about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Also, you can commence a court action to claim compensation for damage or distress caused by our failure to comply with data protection legislation.
If you want to know more about your rights, or you want to exercise them, please visit our dedicated
rights page
found on our Paysafe website. Here you can submit a rights request directly to the relevant team.
In some instances, our use of your personal information may result in automated decisions being taken (including profiling) that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you. Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically based on a computer determination (using software algorithms), without our human review. For example, we use automated decisions to complete credit assessments on you when you apply to certain Services or to conduct anti-fraud checks, as explained in the section “What We Use Your Personal Information For.” We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal information is subject to automated decision-making. In addition, if you are using the Services in the EEA, when we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contacting us at the details below. Privacy laws continue to develop and if you think or are unsure as to whether such right may apply to you, please also contact us, so we can assess and advise.
Paysafe will only process your personal information in compliance with the law. Such laws vary across different territories and further specific information is available on request. In general, Paysafe will either process:
• Based on your consent, for example to send you marketing messages about products and services in accordance with your interests and preferences, where such consent is required by law.
• Where necessary for the performance of, or entry into, any contract we have with you, for example, to provide you with the Services you have subscribed – in that context, we need that information because otherwise we would not be able to provide the Services to you. For example, if we are required to verify your identity and you do not supply us with the relevant information, we may be unable to open an account for you.
• Where Paysafe has a legitimate interest to process data, subject to such processing not overriding your own rights and freedoms in objecting to such processing. For example, to keep you informed about your use of the Services, improve, and develop the Services, conduct online advertising or other marketing activities, as well as manage and enforce any claim.
• Where Paysafe has a legal obligation to collect, use and/or disclose your personal information or otherwise needs your personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, when necessary to comply with the rules imposed by our or other applicable regulators; or
• Exceptionally, we may share your information with a third party when necessary, in the public interest, for example, when law enforcement agencies or other third parties with whom you may have had dealings request information to investigate a crime or otherwise a breach of third-party terms of business.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information for any specific processing activity, please visit our dedicated
rights page
found on our Paysafe website.
Some web browsers may send out “do not track” signals. However, there is no industry standard currently in place as to what websites and other online services should do on receipt of such signals. Should such a standard be developed, we will re-visit our policy, but currently we take no action on receipt of such signals.
