4. Non-Advertising
Element
MIPsoft response
Use of Beacons by a third-party application.
At the client's will, the beacon data (coding) can be made available for third-party use.  The placement and/or configuration of the data (UUID/Major/Minor, Power/Interval), if changed, will have a negative impact on BlindSquare’s use of beacon data.
Use of BPS for advertising purposes
(ie, “BOGO or other mission-distracting messages)
The exclusive mission of BlindSquare is the delivery of information that supports travel, independence and choice for persons who are blind/partially sighted/deaf-blind. Any messaging that detracts from this pure purpose is forbidden and,  if discovered, could affect the renewal of use.
5. Beacon Maintenance
Element
MIPsoft response
Maintenance of beacons is the client's responsibility.
MIPsoft does not sell hardware.
Beacons (generally) are battery-powered and the projected life of the battery is based on the manufacturer's data.
Battery life depends on the make and model of the beacons in use. For example,
Kontakt.io
Beacon Pro beacons
(3x batteries) have a projected battery life of 5 years. This will increase or decrease based on the local power setting (client-managed).
Battery life extenders
are also available through beacon configuration
Instructions for battery replacement
and the specifications of the batteries used are available from the manufacturer.
6. Access to data  <security>
Element
MIPsoft response
Who can access the beacon messaging data?
Is there personal information stored about those who have access?
Who has access to the data?.
BlindSquare manages beacon data “in the cloud” and, based on version controls, will transfer new information from the cloud service whenever BlindSquare is loaded on the device.
The front-end of this cloud-based service is Google Sheets (g.sheets).  Access to the client-specific g.sheet is provided by BlindSquare (as the g.sheet owner) to authorized parties.
Access by authorized parties is protected by their personal Google password and, optionally, two-factor authentication.
Access by any authorized account can be terminated or suspended by BlindSquare with cause or at the authority’s request.
Personal information known to BlindSquare is limited to the email address.
Access to data is limited to BlindSquare resources (for support only) and those authorized by the client.
7. Information vs. instruction
Element
MIPsoft response
Why do you recommend the review of Messaging by an Orientation and Mobility Instructor?
BlindSquare, in the context of message delivery, provides access to information commonly available to persons with vision via text messaging.  This messaging is best presented in “the language of their O&M training,” where consistency and speech-brevity are used to speed comprehension and assimilation.
Further, recognizing that the role of BlindSquare is to provide INFORMATION (not INSTRUCTION) that there is a learned review to ensure that “enough” (not more) information is presented to support the traveller in making an informed decision.
