Data Protection
Data Processing at tooz
Information on how tooz online services (websites, apps, social networks) collect and process your personal information.
Data processing at tooz (e.g. collection, processing, transfer) is performed in accordance with the law. The personal information needed from you for business transactions is stored by us and transferred to service providers contracted by tooz to the extent necessary to process the transactions.
Scope of Application
This data protection notice applies to websites, domains, social media platforms and applications belonging to tooz. In some cases, tooz websites also contain links to websites of third-party, tooz-external companies to which this data protection and legal notice does not apply.
General Data Protection Standard
tooz is a corporation operating on a global scale which has cross-border legally business processes, management structures, and technical systems.
When you visit our websites, data may be collected which may, in some cases, be of a personal nature. In this notice, we point out what personal information tooz collects during your visit to our websites, and how we handle this data.
We consider the protection of your personal information a very serious matter. Our processing of your personal information collected during your visit to our websites is carried out fully in accordance with the relevant legal stipulations. In addition, our approach to dealing with personal information is based on the EU data protection principles which provide for the greatest possible degree of transparency, observance of the right to choose, access rights and the transmission and lawful processing of personal information.
tooz complies with the data protection laws which are applicable in its own particular case. At the same time, we have instructed our employees to refer to and comply with our data protection rules wherever personal information is requested on any website. To the extent legally permissible and with due regard for your legitimate interests in excluding the transmission or use of information, we may forward your address and creditworthiness data to, or request this data from, credit agencies in order to run credit checks for orders.
For orders paid for by invoice, and installment purchases, we use address data in addition to other creditworthiness data to estimate the risk of payment defaults in individual cases.
Furthermore, tooz is permitted to collect and process address and order information for its own marketing purposes. This means, for example, that tooz may compare email addresses collected during order processes with Facebook Ireland Limited’s email address lists in order to display personalized advertisements to the owner of the address. Facebook Ireland Limited is not permitted, however, to use the email address for any purpose other than comparing it with its address list. Information is sent to third parties for advertising purposes only in cases where it is legally permissible to do so.
Notice
You may object to the use, processing and transfer of your personal information at any time by means of an informal written letter addressed to tooz or via email (
dataprivacy@tooztech.com
). Upon receipt of your objection, we will cease to use, process and transfer the information in question for any purpose other than carrying out the orders and tasks you have requested; we will also cease to send you advertising and promotional materials.
Disclosure or objection
Want to know which of your personal information is processed by tooz? Want to object to having your information used? Under Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation and § 34 of the German Federal Data Protection Act 2017 you have a legal right to this and we are happy to comply with your request. Get in touch with us via email
dataprivacy@tooztech.com
.
Gathering, Processing and Transfer of Personal Information
tooz wants to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. Normally, you can access tooz websites without providing any personal information.
However, in certain areas of the tooz websites you are requested to enter personal data in order to help us enhance the site for you and keep in contact with you. Any personal information you submit is treated as confidential and is saved and processed exclusively within the scope of the relationship between you and tooz. Your personal information will not be forwarded, published or otherwise made available to third parties for marketing purposes without your prior approval.
Your personal data may be disclosed to additional categories of recipients for the purposes described in this privacy policy and the respective legal basis stated. These are in particular carefully selected partners who provide services for us. These service providers only handle your personal data as so-called processors on our behalf and according to our instructions. When transferring personal information to these third parties, we restrict ourselves to the information which is necessary for the provision of the service in question and we ensure that this transfer is carried out in compliance with the required data security. tooz will only transfer your personal information to third parties which have committed themselves to data protection and to the processing of your information in compliance with the applicable laws.
In addition, tooz may be forced by court or official orders to disclose your data and associated information. Likewise, we reserve the right to use your information for the assertion of or defence against legal claims.
In the event of a takeover or merger with another company, it may be necessary to disclose or transfer your information to actual or potential buyers. In this case, tooz will aspire to the highest possible level of data protection and will comply with the legal stipulations.
Legal basis for processing personal data
We process your data only in compliance with the applicable laws. In particular, we will process your data in accordance with Article 6 and Article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as in accordance with the conditions for consent in Article 7 GDPR. We will process your data, among other things, upon the following legal bases. Please note that this is not a complete or exhaustive list of the legal bases. These are merely examples intended to render the legal foundations more transparent.
Consent (Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter a GDPR and Article 7 GDPR or Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a and Article 7 GDPR): we will only process certain data on the basis of your explicit and voluntary consent given in advance. You have the right to revoke your consent at any time with effect in the future.
Performance of a contract / pre-contractual measures (Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter b GDPR): we need access to certain data to initiate or perform your contract with tooz.
Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter c GDPR): tooz is subject to a series of legal requirements. In order to meet these requirements, we must process specific data.
Protection of legitimate interests (Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter f): tooz will process specific data to protect its interests or those of third parties. However, this only applies if your interests in the individual case do not override other legitimate interests.
Rights of those affected
You are entitled to request information regarding the personal data we process at any time; you may also object to the processing of this information as well as request that the extent to which your personal information is processed be limited, that information be corrected or that information be deleted. Please note that tooz may only delete your personal information in the event that no legal stipulations exist which require this information to be stored, or in the event that tooz’ right to store this information does not take precedence over your right to have it deleted. Please also note that once you have requested to have your information deleted, or to have the processing of your information limited, or you have objected to the processing of your information, you may then no longer use tooz services, in part or in full, which require the use of your personal information.
If your personal information is being used by tooz because you have agreed to have it used, or because it is required for the fulfilment of a contract you have concluded with tooz, you may request a copy of the information that you have made available to tooz. Please send your request to
dataprivacy@tooztech.com
. Be sure to include which data or processing activities you are requesting information about, in what format you would like to receive this information, and whether the information should be sent to you or another recipient. tooz will carefully review your request and inform you of the best way to fulfil it.
Furthermore, in the following cases you can ask tooz to not share your personal information with others:
If you claim that the personal information held by tooz is incorrect (however, the processing of information in this case will only be limited during the period of time needed by tooz to verify the accuracy of the personal information in question),
If there is no legal basis for the processing of your personal information by tooz and you request that tooz cease processing your information,
If tooz no longer needs your personal information, but you claim that tooz must store this information so that legal claims can be raised or exercised, or so that the claims of third parties can be defended, or
If you object to the processing of your personal information by tooz (on the basis of tooz’ legitimate interest), for the length of time required to verify if tooz’ interest in processing your personal information takes precedence or if a legal requirement to store the information exists.
You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority or our data protection coordinator, in case you have a reason to complain. To exercise your rights against our company, please contact the contact person listed at the end of this privacy policy.
You can also contact the supervisory authority that is responsible for your place of residence or your state, or the supervisory authority that is responsible for us.
