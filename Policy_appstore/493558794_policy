Google Product Privacy Guide
How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

We may also collect information about how you interact with our Sites, emails, and advertisements, such as features used, content viewed, addresses of referring websites, and the dates and times of your interactions. This information is collected automatically as you access the Sites, emails, and advertisements.
Cookies and similar technologies.
Cookies and similar technologies are pieces of information stored directly on the device you are using.
Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Sites, pages visited, and language preferences. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your online experience and our marketing and advertising efforts. In addition, we use cookies to gather statistical information about usage of the Sites in order to improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used, and assist us with resolving questions about them.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. If you set your browser to reject cookies, parts of the Sites may not work for you.
Pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, or other similar technologies. We use these technologies in connection with some of our Sites, emails, or advertisements, to, for example, track the actions of Site users, compile statistics about Site usage and response rates, determine whether you have opened and acted upon our emails, and assess the effectiveness of our marketing.
Analytics and advertising. We use third-party analytics services that use cookies and similar technologies to better understand how users engage with our Sites, including services provided by Google. Please visit
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
for more information about how Google collects and uses data when you use its partners’ websites or mobile applications.
We also use third-party advertising services to provide advertisements for Polaris vehicles, products, or services that may be of interest to you when you visit websites or other online services. This includes targeted advertising (also known as cross-context behavioral advertising, online behavioral advertising, or interest-based advertising).
We allow select third parties, including these analytics and advertising services, to place cookies and similar technologies on our Sites. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites, and they may be members of industry self-regulatory groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (
NAI
), Digital Advertising Alliance (
DAA
), and European Digital Advertising Alliance (
eDAA
). The websites for these groups provide more information on interest-based online advertising and how to opt out of receiving interest-based online ads from participating companies.
Do Not Track requests. Some browsers may transmit “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals to the websites you visit. Because there is not common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not take action in response to them.
Cookie Preferences Settings on our Sites. On certain Sites, you may also be able to accept or reject certain types of cookies and similar technologies on the Site by visiting the “Cookie Preferences,” “Your Privacy Choices,” or similar link on the bottom of the Site. If you visit the Site from multiple browsers, you will need to access the link from each browser to set your preferences for that browser.

Please also note that, if you reject certain types of cookies and similar technologies, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the Site.
Location information: We may collect information about the location of your device, including precise geolocation information from your device and imprecise location from, for example, your IP address.
When you participate in one of our demo rides, or a Polaris Adventures, Indian Motorcycle Rentals, or similar rental experience, the vehicle that you use may be equipped with (i) GPS-tracking and other technology that may collect information related to the state of the vehicle, including, for example, the vehicle’s location, speed, and rate of braking or acceleration; and (ii) cameras that record footage inside and/or near the vehicle while you are operating and/or located near it. Polaris may use this information and footage to provide roadside assistance, to locate lost or stolen vehicles, and as otherwise described in this Notice. The outfitter for the Polaris Adventures or similar rental experience, which is an independent third party, may use this information and footage in accordance with its privacy practices. For questions about the privacy practices of an outfitter, please contact the outfitter directly.
Facility and event cameras: We may use cameras in and around our facilities and event spaces for security purposes and operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns, tracking in-stock levels, and helping us to better design our facilities and event spaces and serve our customers.
Purchase information and history: We may collect information about your transactions on our Sites, including, for example: the vehicles, products and services you purchase, and how frequently you purchase them; the price and any promotions or rewards associated with a purchase; and the items you have placed on your “wishlist” or saved for future purchases.
Information We Receive from Other Sources
We may combine the information that you provide us and that we collect automatically with information that we collect from other sources, such as our dealers, distributors, the business partners we work with to make certain products and services available to you (as described below), consumer data resellers, and other third-party sources.
For example, we receive information from our dealers, distributors, and business partners, such as contact and identification information; financial information; and information about vehicles, products, and website content or services that you have viewed, inquired about, or purchased. Our independent dealers, third-party distributors, and business partners are separate legal entities with their own privacy practices. For questions about the privacy practices of a dealer, distributor, or business partner you interact with, please contact them directly.
We may also obtain demographic and other information about you from consumer data resellers and other third-party sources. This information allows us to enhance our existing information for accuracy, security, and other purposes, such as increasing the relevance of our marketing, improving our communications with you, personalizing your experience with our Sites and services, and detecting fraud.
Some information we collect from third-party sources is publicly available. For example, we may collect information that you or others submit in a public forum, such as a blog, social network, or chat room.
We also create information ourselves when we analyze the information we have collected about you. And we combine information that we collect about you, as described above, with information that we collect in other contexts, such as information we collect through our RIDE COMMAND services, which are subject to a separate
privacy notice
.
