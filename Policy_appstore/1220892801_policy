Weekly Highlights
Overview
The fundamentals for kero / diesels were little changed last week with lower US distillate stocks offset by lower demand.  As a result, days cover increased by 0.3 to 30 days.   However, this is below the five-year average for March of 31.12.  ICE Gas Oil and NYMEX Heating Oil are both oversold but the upside looks limited on continued fears the Trump tariffs will drag the US into a recession.
