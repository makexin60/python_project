About Us
Mobsmile Yazilim Hizmetleri Limited Sirketi. (“Mobsmile”) develops and publishes game titles for mobile devices (each game title, “Title”).
We gather information through two primary methods:
Direct Collection: We acquire information directly through the use of our applications ("Titles"). In this process, we may collaborate with analytics partners who collect this information on our behalf.
Indirect Collection: Information is also gathered indirectly via our advertising and analytics partners.
The information we collect, as outlined in this privacy policy, serves the internal objectives of Mobsmile. As a data controller under relevant data protection laws, we manage this information accordingly.
Scope
This privacy policy outlines Mobsmile's privacy practices in connection with the data it handles concerning its Titles.
These titles are accessible to users worldwide. Consequently, throughout this document, we strive to maintain a consistent approach and employ uniform language within the privacy policy. However, there are instances where we refer to specific regulations that mandate additional disclosures. For instance, whenever you encounter the label "The GDPR angle" within the policy, it signifies that the purpose of that section is to meet the transparency criteria of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, it exclusively pertains to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices that we determine to be situated in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. Should you be a resident of California, Virginia, Connecticut, or Colorado, kindly refer to the "State Privacy Rights" section of this privacy policy for insights concerning privacy regulations in these states.
