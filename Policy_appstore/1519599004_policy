We collect anonymous usage information so we can learn about how best to improve the app. You're welcome to opt out of data collection in the Settings pane of this app.
This usage information does not identify you or single you out in any way; we do not (and cannot) sell your personal information. Here's what we do track:
Your timezone and country, which is derived from your IP address.
Your device operating system and operating system version, as well as the version of the LT app you're using.
The actions you take within the app. We remember your device uniquely (without any identifying information) so we can understand users' behavior across multiple sessions using the app.
We do not store your IP address permanently, though it may be kept for a short period after your usage of the app so that we can protect our servers from malicious use.
If you choose to contact us or report a problem from within the app, we may retain any information you send to us indefinitely so that we can take action on your feedback.
