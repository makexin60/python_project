Get finger piano
finger piano is way better it let's you play songs it's class this is crap really
.listen to kerbdog
Useless
Fun for about 2 seconds, it doesn't work for two reasons; 1) there are only 13 notes to play with meaning you can only play very basic tunes and 2) the keys are too small and you often end up playing the wrong notes.                                 Because the piano has so many notes the iTouch/iPhone is too small for this instrument.
