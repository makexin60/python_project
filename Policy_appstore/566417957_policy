The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration under these Terms of Use may be joined with another arbitration related to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration requirement, with regard to any actual or potential violation of our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in the courts of Washington, DC, and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waive all objections thereto. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, to the extent enforceable by applicable law, we each waive any right to a jury trial.
The following processes shall govern the arbitration process:
Before commencing an arbitration, you agree to inform us of the nature of the claim and the relief you seek by sending an email to
legal@mediadc.com
so
Within seven (7) days, The Washington Examiner will contact you and thereafter you and we will attempt to resolve the claim or issue in a satisfactory way.
If, following these attempts at exploring a resolution, you intend to proceed with an arbitration claim, you and we will seek to reach an agreement on the selection of an arbitrator to hear and decide the dispute and how it will be heard, including whether to submit the dispute to the arbitrator only in written form, by proceedings conducted via video or in-person.
In the event that you and we cannot agree on an arbitrator, the process set forth in Section 11(a) of the Uniform Arbitration Act, or any comparable provision in your state will be followed.
Governing Laws
The laws of the District of Columbia and the United States govern these Terms of Service and any claims arising out of or relating to use of the Services, without giving effect to any choice of law rules. We make no representation that our Services are appropriate, legal, or available for use outside of the United States. With the exception of any matters subject to arbitration as described above, the state and federal courts located Washington, DC will serve as the venue for any actions brought, or claims made, arising out of your use of our Services.

You may not use our Services in any way that violates applicable state, federal, or international laws, regulations, or other government requirements.

Other Terms
If any provision of these Terms of Service shall be unlawful, void or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions (and any partially enforceable provision) shall not be affected thereby and shall remain valid and enforceable to the maximum possible extent. You agree that these Terms of Service and any other agreements referenced herein may be assigned by Washington Examiner, in our sole discretion, to a third party in the event of a merger or acquisition. These Terms of Service shall apply in addition to, and shall not be superseded by, any Additional Terms or other written agreement between us in relation to your participation as a User. You agree and understand that these Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Washington Examiner regarding your use of the Services, and that any and all prior agreements between you and Washington Examiner are superseded by these Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the preceding sentence will not supersede any separate agreements you may enter into with Washington Examiner (including without limitation an advertising agreement, or an agreement to provide content for the Services such as through a freelance author agreement). You may not amend these Terms of Service. Any failure by Washington Examiner to exercise its rights under these Terms of Service or to enforce the terms hereof will not constitute a waiver of those rights. If any term of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court in any event should try to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and that all of the other provisions of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

Commercial Purposes
We and certain third parties process Personal Data we hold for certain purposes, depending on the context of collection and your

We use Profiles for our legitimate interests in market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services. For example, we may analyze the Personal Data of customers who have subscribed to our Publications in the past and compare them with other people in our database. If we identify customers in the database who have similar Personal Data to the subscribers, we may then target marketing to the new customers we have identified in our database, for example by sending marketing emails.

Personalized Marketing Communications

This form of advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for Targeted Advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from
Personalization
,
Profiles
, and
Marketing Communications

In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a Profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other Preference Data, and may track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you purchased advertised goods or services.
We generally use Targeted Advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, and to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites or social media platforms.
