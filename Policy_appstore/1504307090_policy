"LiDAR Scanner 3D" Privacy Policy
By downloading or using the LiDAR Scanner 3D application you agree to this privacy policy, if you do not agree with this privacy policy, please do not download or use the LiDAR Scanner 3D application.
This application uses Camera and the LiDAR Sensor to obtain depth measurements and RGB frames that are used to create 3D model and live preview of the camera data. The captured 3D scans are stored only on your device and do not leave it util you decide to export and share it. You have full control over all of your data (3D scans) â€” you can view and permanently delete them.
The application does not track you in any way, does not collect data to any servers and does not use any advertising. The application does not include/implement any analytics. This means it does not use the Internet connection to send any data, except when loading information about in-app purchases (IAPs), buying IAPs and restoring IAPs (and therefore definitely does not work with any of your personal information and cannot identify you (there is no reason to do so) â€” no tracking is involved).
No third parties are involved. You own your data and they are shared with no third party.
