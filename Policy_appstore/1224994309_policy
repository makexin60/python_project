PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT INDIRECTLY
We indirectly collect Personal Information when someone uses Foodzilla to record data about someone other than themselves. A typical scenario would be when a healthcare professional records information about a patient or client.
This information can include names, genders, dates of birth, email addresses, information about nutrition and exercise, and patient treatment notes and records. This can include sensitive information such as health records.
Browser and hardware data
, such as IP address, type of device, operating system, browser type, screen resolution, language, device make and model, as well as the versions of the above mentioned services.
Cookie and tracking technology data
, which would include pages visited, time spent on pages, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.
Transaction data
, including details about your Foodzilla subscription, payment dates, and renewal dates.
SECTION 2 - HOW THIS INFORMATION IS USED
Generally speaking, the Personal Information we collect is used by us to operate Foodzilla.
The Personal Information we collect about our own Customers is mostly used for billing, identification, authentication, and for contacting them if we need to.
The special category of Personal Information such as nutrition and exercise data is used to help our Customers visualize their health data and/or their patients' health data.
We may, with consent, use email addresses to share news, tips, updates and special offers. People who receive these promotional emails can unsubscribe at any time.
We may use other data for a range of different purposes, provided we comply with applicable law and our contractual commitments. In some countries (for example, European Economic Area countries), local legal regimes may require us to treat some or all of other data as “personal data” under applicable data protection laws. Where this is the case, we will process other data only for the same purposes as “personal data” under this Privacy Policy.
Foodzilla does not use your personal information for AI training purposes and does not share your personal information with any AI service.
Other ways we may use your Personal Information:

We minimise the amount of personal data that is utilised by these services, and we have ensured that these services process your data in accordance with the appropriate regulations.
In rare circumstances, we may be obliged to disclose Personal Information if disclosure is required to comply with the law, if we believe our Terms of Service, located at
https://foodzilla.com/terms.html
