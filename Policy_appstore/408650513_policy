Description
Transform your iPhone or iPod in a dangerous finger cutter.
Touch the screen and avoid the sharp blade by taking your fingers away as soon as it starts sliding down.
But watch out! The longer you let the blade fall, the faster it gets and avoiding it becomes more difficult.
Challenge yourself and your friends to a cool contest based on concentration and ability. Just focus and you’ll be able to avoid the blade even though it slides down at high speed.
- Possibility to record scores to compete with friends.
- Possibility to reset scores to let your friends play.
