Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 07/31/2024
This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") explains how Aethia, ("we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, and discloses personal information from users of our AI app (the "App"). By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Policy.
Information We Collect
We collect two types of information from users of the App: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
1. Personal Information:
"Personal Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. The following are examples of Personal Information we may collect from users of the App:
* User profile information (e.g., username, profile avatar)
* Contact information (e.g., email address)
* Disposable facial images or other biometric data (only if you use our edit photo/video features)
* Other information you choose to provide us through the App (e.g., feedback, survey responses)
2. Non-Personal Information:
"Non-Personal Information" means information that does not reveal your identity. The following are examples of Non-Personal Information we may collect from users of the App:
* Device information (e.g., device type, operating system version, screen resolution)
* Log data (e.g., log files, browser type, referring URL)
* Usage information (e.g., interaction with features)
* Aggregated data (e.g., user behavior trends)
How We Use Your Information
We use your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for the following purposes:
1. To provide and improve the App: We use your information to deliver the App's features and services, to improve their quality, and to develop new ones. This includes processing your requests, detecting and preventing fraud or abuse, and personalizing your experience.
2. To communicate with you: We use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, support tickets, and comments. With your consent, we may also send you marketing messages, updates, or newsletters.
3. For research and development: We use anonymized and aggregated data to conduct research, analyze trends, and develop new technologies.
4. Compliance with laws and regulations: We use your information as necessary to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, and regulatory requirements.
Information Disclosure
We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties unless one of the following applies:
1. You have given us explicit consent to do so.
2. The sharing is necessary for a business transfer, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
3. The sharing is required by law, court order, or other governmental request.
4. The sharing is necessary to protect our rights, property, or users from harm.
Data Retention
We store your Personal Information only for as long as it takes to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to process your request, answer your question). After that, we delete the information or transform it into an anonymous form.
Your data will not be shared, sold, or used for training purposes without your explicit consent.
Use of Uploaded Images
Users may optionally upload a customized avatar. This avatar is only used as an icon to distinguish that messages and posts are from the user.
Storage of Uploaded Images
Uploaded avatars are stored exclusively for display purposes within the app. Users have the ability to delete their uploaded avatars at any time through the "My Profile" page. Once deleted, the avatar is permanently removed from our servers. We only retain face data or avatars for as long as necessary to support the app's functionality, ensuring users retain full control over their content. Uploaded avatars or face data in profile image will not be shared with any third parties.
Temporary Storage
Input data temporarily stored on our servers for AIGC purposes will be automatically deleted after 48 hours.
Input data on-demand such as saved templates by the user stored on our servers for AIGC purposes will be removed immediately by the user's delete request.
Input data will not be shared, sold, or used for training purposes without user's consent.
Content Sharing for Generated Works
By default, images or videos you create using our AI app might be publicly accessible, meaning other users can download and remix them when set to public and sharable. 
This helps build a fun and creative space where people can collaborate and explore new ideas. If you'd prefer to keep your content private, you can easily mark it as private while creating or afterward, so only you can see it. 
You can also delete any of your creations whenever you want.
Security Measures
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include encryption, firewalls, secure servers, and other security technologies. We also restrict access to your Personal Information to only those employees, agents, and contractors who need to know that information to provide the App's services.
Third-Party Services
Our Application may contain links to third-party services or websites. We have no control over their privacy policies or practices, and this Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Application.
Your Rights
You have certain rights and choices about your personal information, including the right to access, correct and delete your information. You can also choose not to receive our promotional communications.
Children's Privacy
The product is not intended for children under 12 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 12. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete the information.

We may update this Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" section at the beginning of this page indicates when the most recent changes were made.
