Privacy Policy
This is a privacy policy for the applications that I, Konstantin Adamov (a.k.a. Ray Adams), have developed for mobile and other devices.
To use my Products, you may need to provide some personal information, such as your name, address, date of birth, email address, or phone number.
By providing this information, you agree to let me use it as described in this policy.
You can withdraw your consent at any time by sending me an email at
rayadam@outlook.com
. I will delete or erase your personal information within five days after receiving your request.
I will not share your information with any third parties. If any of my applications require access to your device's GPS location, I will only use that data within the application and not store it anywhere without your permission.
If any of my applications collect any information, I will mention that in the application description.
I may update this policy from time to time and post the changes on my Website. Please check my Website regularly to see the latest version of this policy.
