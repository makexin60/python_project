Cashflow Balance Sheet Privacy Policy
The Cashflow Balance Sheet app doesnâ€™t collect or transmit any personally identifiable information out of the app. It will let you enter a
	                name when you start a new sheet, but it is just for decorative purposes on your Balance Sheet and that information is not transmitted off of the device.
The app uses Google Crashlytics crash reporting to help us find and fix bugs. No personally identifiable information is included
					with those crash reports.
