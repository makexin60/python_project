These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement.

When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Europe
‚Äù as defined at the top of this Privacy Policy).
Personal information. References to ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù in this Privacy Policy should be understood to include a reference to ‚Äúpersonal data‚Äù (as defined in the GDPR) ‚Äì i.e., information about individuals from they are either directly identified or can be identified.
Controller.
Fleek is the controller in respect of the processing of your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy for purposes of European data protection legislation (i.e., the
EU GDPR
and the so-called ‚Äò
UK GDPR‚Äô
(as and where applicable, the ‚Äú
GDPR
‚Äù)).
See the ‚ÄòHow to contact us‚Äô section above for our contact details.
Our legal bases for processing.
In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your personal information, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a ‚Äúlegal basis‚Äù for that use.
Our legal bases for processing your personal information described in this Privacy Policy are listed below.
Where we need to perform a contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (‚Äú
Contractual Necessity
‚Äù).
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (‚Äú
Legitimate Interests
‚Äù). More detail about the specific legitimate interests pursued in respect of each Purpose we use your personal information for is set out in the table below.
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (‚Äú
Compliance with Law
‚Äù).
Where we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question (‚Äú
Consent
‚Äù).
We have set out below, in a table format, the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant Purposes for which we use your personal information ‚Äì for more information on these Purposes and the data types involved, see ‚ÄòHow we use your personal information‚Äô
No sensitive personal information.
We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the services, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the services, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our services.

If you believe we might have any information from or about a person under 16, please contact us at
contact@joinfleek.com
.
Transfers.
We may transfer your personal information outside of the EEA and/or UK. Some of these recipients may be located in countries in respect of which either the European Commission and/or UK Government (as and where applicable) has issued adequacy decisions, in which case, the recipient‚Äôs country is recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under UK and/or European data protection laws (as applicable) and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Some recipients of your personal data may be located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK for which the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) has not issued adequacy decisions in respect of the level of data protection in such countries (‚ÄúRestricted Countries‚Äù). For example, the United States is a Restricted Country. Where we transfer your personal information to a recipient in a Restricted Country, we will either:
enter into appropriate data transfer agreements based on so-called Standard Contractual Clauses approved from time-to-time under GDPR Art. 46 by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office or UK Government (as and where applicable); or
rely on other appropriate means permitted by the EEA/UK GDPR, which establish that such recipients will provide an adequate level of data protection and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
You may ask for a copy of such appropriate data transfer agreements, where applicable, by contacting us using the contact details above.
Your rights.
European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information.
If you are located in Europe, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:
Access.
Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.
Correct.
Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.
Delete.
Delete your personal information where there is no lawful reason for us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be described to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;.
Portability
. Port a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice, in certain circumstances. Note that this right only applies to automated information for which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Restrict
. Restrict the processing of your personal information, if, (i) you want us to establish the personal information's accuracy; (ii) where our use of the personal information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the personal information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your personal information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Object.
Object to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on Legitimate Interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedom ‚Äì you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
Withdraw Consent
. When we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
Exercising These Rights.
You may submit these requests by email to
contact@joinfleek.com
or our postal address provided above.
We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request.
Whether or not we are required to fulfill any request you make will depend on a number of factors (e.g., why and how we are processing your personal information), if we reject any request you may make (whether in whole or in part) we will let you know our grounds for doing so at the time, subject to any legal restrictions.
Your Right to Lodge a Complaint with your Supervisory Authority
