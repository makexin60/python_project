Please note that statistical data that we collect when you visit our	website cannot be associated with you and is not covered by the definition of personal data.
3. What Personal Data do we Collect?
The personal data we collect about you are personal data you provide us with when you contact us, request	a quote, make enquiries, visit our website, enter into an agreement with us, complete our survey or use	our services. Such personal data may be, for example, contact details, login details, order and payment	details, prior purchases as well as information about how you use our services. In some instances, we	also collect personal data about you from other sources such as our third-party partners, as we further	set out in this Privacy Notice. In order to develop our website and app services, we also use cookies	which may contain personal data. You can read more about how we use cookies in our cookie policy,	available

Additional information you provide in your communications with us.
You may consider it necessary to provide information to Verisure about special requirements to receive	our services, such as health data (i.e. hearing impairment or physical disability), which are relevant	for the efficient management of delivering our alarm monitoring services to you. In such cases, Verisure	may have to process this information about your health (e.g. regarding impairment of hearing that	prevents you from hearing the siren), or other form of disability. In some cases, there may also be	instances where we may have to collect and process this information for other legal requirements,	including under employment law.
Such health data is a special category of personal data. This means we must treat it with extra care	under applicable data protection requirements.
This special category personal data may be provided by you or indirectly during or following your	interactions with us (through e.g., chat, e-mail, text messages, calls to our customer services centre	or in person during a maintenance visit recorded by our staff).
Where we process such special category personal data we will do so, based on the following legal basis	and purposes where:
It is necessary to protect your, or someone else’s, vital interests:
we reasonably believe that you or another person are at risk of harm (if we do not	process the data about you) and the processing is necessary to protect you or them from	harm or to protect physical, mental or emotional well-being;
we reasonably believe it is necessary to protect the economic well-being of you or	another person, where you or that person is less able to protect your own economic	well-being by reason of physical or mental injury, illness or disability;
it is necessary for the prevention or detection of an unlawful act;
we need to carry out our obligations or rights in connection with employment, for example where	we need to protect our staff members from harm.
We may also collect such data where we have your consent to do so.
Where you choose to provide health data voluntarily which it is not clear to us obviously falls into any	of the categories above, we will discuss with you whether we should retain it and, if necessary (and not	for the above purposes) will obtain your consent to future processing of that data.
This paragraph only applies to your special category personal data and should be read in conjunction with	our wider privacy notice which governs the collection and processing of all personal information about	you. If you need more information on the above, or have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact	us.
4. How We Collect your Data - Data Processing on Our Website, App, and Products
Our Website and App
Every time you use our website and app, we collect the access data that your browser or device	automatically	transmits to allow you to visit the website or app. This data is standard technical data (so-called log	files) that are transmitted to our server:
IP address of the requesting device.
Date and time of request.
Address of the website and the requesting website.
Information about the browser used, the operating system and the ISP.
Online identifiers (e.g. device identifiers, session IDs).
Volume.
The data processing of this access data is necessary to enable the visit of the website and the use of	our app, and lastly facilitates the functionality and safety of our systems. For the purposes described	above, access data is also temporarily stored in internal log files to provide statistical information	about the use of our website and app in order to provide our website with the usage habits of our	visitors. (For example, the number of mobile devices used to retrieve the pages) and to maintain our	website and app administratively in general. The legal basis is our
legitimate interest
to enable you to	visit the website, use our app and ensure functionality and safety of our system.
The information stored in the log files does not allow any direct conclusions to be drawn about you – in	particular, we only store the IP addresses in a shortened, anonymised form.
Contact
You have different ways to get in touch with us through our website or app. This includes the contact	form for calculating an offer, contacting our customer support or sales team by email or phone, or the	recall function. The following data is collected: Your first and last name, home address, email address,	telephone number and a general description of your property and lifestyle habits. We obtain this data	either directly from you, for example when you use our website, or from third party aggregators to which	you may provide such information, such as price comparison websites. Please note that we record calls	for quality and training purposes.
To the extent that the information is required to initiate or execute a contract with you, for example,	to provide an accurate individual offer, we will process it solely for this purpose and the legal basis	for this is the entering into and the
performance of our contract
with you. To the extent this	information is necessary to respond to your requests, including to provide you with information about	our services or make an appointment to assess your security requirements and to help the salesperson	make a booking to visit you, the legal basis for this processing is our
legitimate interest
. In	addition, we also collect this data for statistical purposes in order to improve our products and	services, as well as for internal purposes, to provide training for our employees and to carry out	quality checks. These processing activities are based on our
legitimate interest
.
Registration
You can register to use the full functionality of our website, app and products. This includes the	possibility of reviewing and configuring your alarm system, support requests, and the ability to order	other products. We have highlighted the data we require by labelling them as required. These are your	first and last name, mobile number, email address and password. Registration is not possible without	this data. The legal basis for this processing is the
performance of our contract with you

Social Media
We operate a page (fan page) on the social network (Facebook), which is available to users outside the	USA and Canada from Facebook Ireland Limited ("Facebook") and for all other users from Facebook USA,	which is offered, in joint responsibility with Facebook, to communicate with followers (such as our	customers and prospective customers) and to inform you about our products and services.
Facebook allows us to obtain statistics on engagements on our page (for example, information about	number, names, interactions such as like and comments, as well as aggregated demographic and other	information or statistics). More information on the nature and scope of these statistics can be found in	the
Facebook page statistics notices
. More information about the respective responsibilities can be	found on the
Facebook page insights addition.
The legal basis for this data processing is based on our	aforementioned
legitimate interest
.
We have no control over data that Facebook processes under its own responsibility in accordance with	Facebook's terms of service. However, we would like to point out that when you visit the fan page, data	from your usage behaviour is transferred from Facebook and the fan page to Facebook. Facebook itself	processes the aforementioned information to create more detailed statistics and for its own market	research and advertising purposes over which we have no control. More information can be found in the
Data policy
from Facebook.
Where we operate a Facebook fan page we receive your personal data, to this end, we set out your rights	in this Privacy Statement. If you want to assert your rights with Facebook, the easiest way to do this	is to contact Facebook directly. Facebook knows both the details of the technical operation of their	platform and the associated data processing as well as the specific purposes of data processing and can	implement appropriate measures upon request if you wish to exercise your rights. We are happy to support	you when asserting your rights, as far as we can and direct your inquiries to Facebook.
Direct marketing communications
We partner with marketing companies for the purpose of identifying and getting in touch with prospective	customers. These companies obtain marketing consent on our behalf through third-party websites which	organise surveys, competitions, or prize draws. If you visit those websites and give your consent to	receive Verisure marketing, your contact details will be passed on to us and we will send you marketing	communications.

5. Our Processing of Personal Data
We use your personal data for the following purposes:
a. Administration and Performance of Contracts
We use your personal data to provide, administer and personalise our products and services, to enable	login	to our website and app and to provide customer service to you as our customer. For this purpose, we	process	personal data such as contact details, order and payment details, login details and sensitive personal	data	if you provide that to us. Our legal basis for this purpose is
Performance of a Contract
.
GPS position and Geo-location: We process the GPS position of protected locations in order to fulfil our	contractual obligations, including to dispatch a private security guard as quickly as possible if	necessary.
Depending on your equipment, we can also track the GPS position of your mobile device, only if you	accepted	it when installing the app and only to provide you with the @Home SOS service, allowing us under some	conditions to process an SOS signal launched from your MyVerisure mobile app, and/or send you push	notifications relevant to your location. You can turn off your mobile device's geolocation at any time	from	your device settings (in which case you will not be able to take advantage of all the services offered	by	the app). Geo-location relies on default maps SDKs, such as Google Maps SDK to geo-localise the device.
b. Marketing, Including Targeted Direct Marketing
Subject to your marketing preferences, including your settings on advertising cookies, we process your	personal data for marketing purposes, including profiling for direct marketing. Our marketing activities	include the following:
Email marketing
: Sending marketing communications via email about Verisure,	including offers about	our products and services, newsletters, information about new products and competitions we may	organise from time to time. When we send you marketing emails, we also monitor whether you open	these emails and/or click on URLs in our emails. We obtain your contact details for email	marketing predominantly through our third-party partners: we partner with marketing companies	and third-party websites which organise surveys, competitions or prize draws. If you visit those	websites and give your consent for your contact details to be passed on to Verisure for	marketing purposes, we will add you to our marketing list and send you email marketing. You can	withdraw your consent at any time, by following the unsubscribe link contained in our marketing	emails or by getting in touch with our Contact Centre by writing to marketinguk@verisure.co.uk.
We act as joint controllers with those partners when they obtain consent from our prospective	customers for our marketing activities. In this case, our partners remain responsible for how	they use your information, for obtaining your marketing consent and for providing you with	appropriate information about using your information and sharing this with Verisure Services	(UK) Ltd. You can contact us directly if you would like to exercise your data protection rights	(for example, if you would like to withdraw your consent), but please note that these partners	remain solely responsible for any use of your personal data that does not relate to Verisure,	and you should contact them directly if your request is not relevant to Verisure.
Calls
: Contacting on the phone prospective customers who have been referred to	us by their friends or family. Sometimes, when our customers or prospective customers get in	touch with us, they also share with us the contact details of friends or family members who are	interested in our products and services. In that instance, we would call them to discuss their	security needs and our offerings.
As we explain above, we will also contact you on the phone if you have requested a quote through	our website or through third-party aggregator websites, such as price comparison websites with	which we cooperate, in order to fulfil your request, discuss your security needs and provide you	a quote for our products and services. In that case, we will not use your contact details for	wider marketing purposes.
Marketing personalisation
: Creating marketing profiles about our customers and	prospective customers, in order to understand their preferences in relation to our products and	services, and to deliver personalised advertising.
List-based matching
: social media providers give us the option to find our	existing and prospective customers on their platforms and show them our ads. For example, we	provide Facebook with our customers’ email addresses in an encrypted form (hashed); if a	customer	has a Facebook account with the same email address, Facebook will match this information and	will	show them our ads on its platform. In some cases, we ask these parties to show our ads only if	we	think this will be particularly relevant to a customer, based on information they hold on that	customer such as demographics (e.g. age), activity on the social media platform or other	websites,	location or interests. We will not receive though this information about our customers. There	can	also be cases where we provide social media platforms with your hashed email address, so as to	ensure that they do not show our ads to you. We currently use this matching activity with the	following parties: Meta Platforms, Nextdoor, TikTok and Snapchat.
Lookalike matching
: we also use personal information of our customers to allow	social media platforms to find individuals who have a similar profile to our customers and who	we expect are interested to find out more about our products and services, so as to show our	ads to them. For example, we provide Facebook with hashed email addresses of our customers,	which Facebook would match with these customers’ Facebook profiles. Based on these profiles,	Facebook will look for other Facebook users who have a similar profile to our customer and	would show them our ads. We currently use this matching activity with the following partners:	Meta Platforms, TikTok and Snapchat.
Social media advertising
: We also use personal data when the users of our	website interact with third party social networking features, such as “Like” functions, to serve	them with advertisements and engage with them on third party social networks. You can learn more	about how these features work, the profile data that we obtain about you, and find out how to	opt out, by reviewing the privacy notices of the relevant third- party social networks. For	example, we currently use Facebook and Instagram for these purposes.
For these marketing activities, we use your personal information such as contact details, browsing	habits, interests and visit history, order and demographic information.
We rely on your
consent
when the law requires us to do so; for example, we obtain your consent to use	advertising	cookies and similar technologies and to send you marketing emails. Otherwise, our legal basis for our	marketing	activities is our
legitimate interest
to keep you informed of and promote our products and services and	to manage	our relationship with you as our customer, to the extent this is allowed by law.
You always have the right to opt out of marketing directed to you. To do so, contact us at	marketinguk@verisure.co.uk. You can also unsubscribe from email marketing specifically, by clicking on	the unsubscribe link in the relevant marketing communication.
c. Surveys and Business Development

Rather, the main purpose of our own cookies is to provide a specially tailored offer to you and to	make the use of our services as timesaving as possible.
Most browsers are set by default to accept cookies. However, you can adjust your browser settings so	that cookies are rejected or stored only after prior consent. If you reject cookies, not all of our	offers will be available to you.
We use cookies to facilitate navigation on the site, for security reasons and to achieve greater	efficiency and personalization of the services offered to users. We want to make it possible for you	to use our website more comfortably and individually. These services are based on our aforementioned	legitimate interests.
We also use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons) from partners for analytical and	marketing purposes. This is described in more detail in the following sections. Further information can	also be found at
https://www.verisure.com/cookies-policy
.
Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies for Analysis Purposes
To improve our website, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons) to statistically	collect and analyse general usage behaviour using access data. We also use analytical services to	evaluate the use of our various marketing channels.
The legal basis for the data processing described in the following section is our
legitimate interest
in	the needs-based design and continuous optimisation of our website.
Google Analytics
Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google. According to Google, the contact	for all data protection matters is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4,	Ireland. Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to analyse and improve our website based	on your user behaviour. The data generated in this context can be transmitted by Google to a server in	the USA for evaluation and stored there. However, your IP address will be shortened before the usage	statistics are evaluated, so that no conclusions can be drawn about your identity. For this purpose,	Google Analytics has been expanded on our website to include the code "anonymizeIP" to ensure anonymised	collection of IP addresses.
Google will process the information obtained through the cookies to evaluate your use of the website, to	compile reports on website activities for website operators, and to provide additional information	relating to website use and internet use Services.
You can configure your browser to reject cookies, as shown above, or you can prevent the collection of	data generated by cookies related to your use of this website (including your IP address) and Google's	processing of that data by using a Google provided
Browser Add-On
. This prevents data collection by	Google Analytics within this website in the future (the opt-out only works in the browser and only for	this domain). If you delete your cookies in this browser, you will need to click this link again.

Privacy policy Google
.
Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies for Online Advertising
We also use cookies and similar technologies for advertising purposes. Some of the access data accessed	when using our website is used for interest-based advertising. By analysing and evaluating this access	data, we are able to show you personalised advertising on our website and on the websites of other	providers. This means advertising that suits your real interests and needs.
The legal basis for the data processing described in the following section is based on our
legitimate	interest
in promoting our products and services in personalised form.
In the following section, we would like to explain these technologies and the vendors used for them in	more detail.
Data collected may be, in particular,
The IP address of the device.
The date and time of access.
The identification number of a cookie.
Device recognition of mobile devices.
And technical information about the browser and operating system.
However, the collected data is stored only pseudonymously, so that no direct conclusions can be drawn	about you.
Through corresponding settings on the websites, you can refuse to take part in our analytical and	advertising measures as both sites provide the capability to block many advertisers. Both websites allow	the listed providers to disable all ads at once using opt-out cookies or, alternatively, to make the	settings for each provider. Please note that after deleting all cookies in your browser or later using	another browser and/or profile, an opt-out cookie must be set again.
Custom Audience Matching
As we described above, we use Facebook’s Custom Audience service. This service uses both information that	you provide to us or our marketing partners (for example, your email address) and also information	collected through cookies and similar technologies, such as Facebook’s pixel. With the help of its	pixel, Facebook is able to determine which visitors to our website are also Facebook users, so as to	display our ads to those users on Facebook. This allows us to target our advertising on Facebook and	show our ads to users who have shown an interest in our online offering.
Similar to Facebook’s Custom Audience, we also use equivalent services provided by Instagram, Google,	Microsoft, TikTok and Snapchat and Nextdoor.
Google Ads Conversion Tracking
Our websites use “Google Ads," which is available to users from the European Economic Area, Switzerland	and Liechtenstein from Google Ireland Limited. “AdWords conversion tracking" captures customers’ actions	(such as clicking on an ad, page views, downloads) and analyse them. We make use of "AdWords	Remarketing” to show you individualised advertising messages for our products on partner websites of	Google. Both services used cookies and similar technologies. The data generated in this context can be	transmitted by Google to a server in the USA for evaluation and stored there.
If you use a Google account, Google can link your web and app browsing history to your Google account,	depending on the settings stored in the Google account, and use information from your Google account to	personalise ads. If you do not want this assignment to your Google account, you may need to log out of	Google before using our website.
You can configure your browser to reject cookies, as shown above. In addition, you can turn off the	Personalised Advertising button from Google
Advertising settings
. In this case, Google will only display	general advertising that has not been selected based on the information you collect.
More information can be found in the
Information on data usage
and
Google Privacy policy

Google Marketing Platform
DoubleClick uses cookies and similar technologies to present ads that are relevant to you. The use of the	DoubleClick allows Google and its partner websites to serve ads based on previous visits to our or other	websites on the Internet. The data generated in this context can be transmitted by Google to a server in	the USA for evaluation and stored there.
You can prevent cookies from being stored by adjusting your browser accordingly (as described above);	However, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to make full use of all the	functions of the website. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookies	relating to your use of the website, as well as Google's processing of that data by clicking
Browser plug-in to	deactivate DoubleClick
. As an alternative to the browser plug-in or within browsers on mobile	devices, you can browse the Google
Advertising settings

9. Disclosure of Data
As a matter of principle, the data collected by us will only be passed on if we have your express consent	or where it is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to believe	that you have an overriding interest in the absence of disclosure of your data or are required by law or	permitted by law and in where required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you or for	the implementation of pre-contractual measures, which will be carried out at your request.
However, we may share them with other Verisure entities as part of the delivery of our products and	services. Because our products and services and their execution require the skills and resources of	other	companies, some of the data processing can be done by our service providers below although this is not	an	exhaustive list of providers and may be changed from time to time. Categories of these recipients	include:
Cloud storage providers such as Amazon Cloud Cam for storing alarm records and the personal	information you provide, and for emergency recovery services, as well as for fulfilling	contracts	we enter with you.
Account managers who support us in providing our forms and invoices as well as in contacting you.
Telephone providers (Verint, Genesys, Inconcert) through which we will contact you by phone.
Payment service providers (iZettle; GoCardless) with which we process your installation and	service	payments.

Credit financing companies, such as Humm, in order to process your payment and provide you with	the	requested credit facilities.
Security companies such as Aura UK Services Limited (Company No. 13130147), 6th Floor Charles House, 108-110 Finchley Road, London, United Kingdom, NW3 5JJ, in which we send a security	guard in case an alarm is raised.

Business partners (such as business introducers, online sales sites) when you have accepted that	they communicate your details to us so that we can offer you our products and/services. We may	share your data to identify that you already benefit from our product and service offers in	order	to prevent these partners from soliciting you again, or so that these partners can, where	applicable, grant you the advantages granted within the framework of the subscription to a	particular commercial offer. For more information on the marketing partners we use in the	context	of our email marketing activities, please see above, section 5 “Our processing of personal	data”,	sub-section “Marketing, including Targeted Direct Marketing”.
Social media networks, such as Meta Platforms, Google, Nextdoor, Microsoft, TikTok, Snapchat to	present our ads to you on other platforms and to allow those parties to show you tailored	advertising. For example, we may share with Meta Platforms the actions that you take on our	website	such as your visits to our website, your interactions on our website, use of Facebook Connect	and	information collected from cookies or similar technologies including the Facebook pixel. This	allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, improve our marketing practices, and	helps us deliver more relevant advertising to you (including on social media such as Facebook):	for	this activity, we are a Joint Controller with Meta Platforms Inc. This means that we have to	provide you with this notice, but you should contact Meta Platforms Inc if you wish to exercise	your data protection rights. Further information, including how Meta Platforms Inc enable you to	exercise your data protection rights, and subsequently processes your information as independent	data controller can be found in

Credit Reference Agency- We use Equifax to conduct an affordability check. As part of the	affordability check we may provide your name and address to Equifax who provide us with the	credit	check results. To proceed with the affordability check, we rely on your consent. These are	‘soft’	credit checks (i.e. the search will appear on your credit file but it will not impact your	credit	score). Equifax will disclose information in relation to your financial standing based on	publicly	available data such as county court judgements and credit search history. During the credit	score	check, Verisure and Equifax act as independent data controllers. Copy of the Credit Reference	Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) is available at
www.equifax.co.uk/crain
In the event of a company purchase or sale to a third party, your information will be forwarded	to	the potential buyer or the new owner.
If we disclose data to service providers, they may only use the data to perform their tasks. The service	providers were carefully selected and commissioned by us. They are contractually bound by our	instructions, have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to protect the rights of	the persons concerned and are regularly monitored by us.
In addition, disclosure may take place in connection with government inquiries, court orders, legal	proceedings or if it is necessary to disclose your data to law enforcement authorities for preventing or	detecting unlawful acts also known as Criminal Offence Data under sections 10,11 (2) and in compliance	with Schedule 1 (paragraphs 10 or 36) of the Data Protection Act 2018 and Articles 6 and 10 of UK GDPR.	If we share data in this regard, our legal basis is
compliance with legal obligation
.
10. Where Data is Processed
As a matter of principle, we store your information within the UK, the EU or within the European Economic	Area (EEA). Or in countries that have an appropriate level of data protection.
If we share your information with companies outside (i) of the EEA or (ii) the UK or (iii) countries with	an appropriate level of data protection, we contractually require these companies to treat your	information on a similar basis to ours.

11. How Long is Data Stored?
As a matter of principle, we only retain personal data for as long as this is necessary to comply with	contractual or legal obligations to which we have collected the data. After that, we delete the data	immediately, unless we still need the data until the expiry of statutory limitation periods, for	evidence	of civil claims or due to legal retention obligations.
We may also have to store your data for some accounting reasons. We are obliged to do so because of legal	documentation obligations, which may arise from the Commercial Code, the Tax Code, the Credit	Information	Act, the Money Laundering Act and the Securities Trading Act.
12. Your Rights
You have the right to request:
Your right
What does it mean?
How do I execute this right?
Conditions to exercise?
Right of access
Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to have access to your personal data	which we	hold (this is more commonly known as submitting a “data subject access request”).
Requests for such information should be made in writing to
dataprotection@verisure.co.uk
.	If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to	ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.
We must be able to verify your identity. Your request may not affect the rights and	freedoms of others, e.g. privacy and confidentiality rights of other customers or	third parties for example neighbours. Data solely retained for data backup purposes	is principally excluded.
Right of data portability
Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to receive the data which you have	provided to us and which is processed by us by automated means, in a commonly-used	machine readable format.
Requests should be made in writing to
dataprotection@verisure.co.uk
.	If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to receive to	ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.
The UK GDPR does not establish a general right to data portability. This right only	applies if the processing is based on your consent or on our contract with you and	when the processing is carried out by automated means (e.g. not for paper records).	It affects only personal data that was “provided” by you. Hence, it does, as a rule,	not apply to personal data that was created by Verisure Services (UK) Ltd.
Rights in relation to inaccurate personal or incomplete data
You may challenge the accuracy or completeness of personal data which we process	about you. If it is found that personal data is inaccurate, you are entitled to have	the inaccurate data removed, corrected or completed, as appropriate.
We encourage you to notify us of any changes regarding your personal data as soon as	they occur, including changes to your contact details, telephone number, immigration	status and so on. Please always check first whether self-help tools are available.	If no such tools are available, requests should be made in writing to
dataprotection@verisure.co.uk
.
This right only applies to your own personal data. When exercising this right, please	be as specific as possible.
Right to object to or restrict our data processing
Subject to certain conditions, you have the right to object to or ask us to restrict	the processing of your personal data.
Requests should be made in writing to
dataprotection@verisure.co.uk
.
This right applies only if the processing of your personal data is explicitly based	on our so-called “legitimate interests” (see “basis of processing” above).	Objections must be based on grounds relating to your particular situation. They must	not be generic so that we can demonstrate that there are still lawful grounds for us	to process your personal data.
Right to have personal data erased
Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled, on certain grounds, to have your	personal data erased (also known as the “right to be forgotten”), e.g., where you	think that the information we are processing is inaccurate, or the processing is	unlawful.
Requests should be made in writing to
dataprotection@verisure.co.uk
.
There are various lawful reasons why we may not be in a position to erase your	personal data. This may apply (i) where we have to comply with a legal obligation,	(ii) in case of exercising or defending legal claims, or (iii) where retention	periods apply by law or our statutes.
Right to withdrawal
You have the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have	previously given that consent.
Requests should be made in writing to
dataprotection@verisure.co.uk
.
If you withdraw your consent, this will only take effect for the future.
