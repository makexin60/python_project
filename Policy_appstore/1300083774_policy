Marketing and profiling
Legitimate interest
When you interact with Appical e.g. by visiting Appical web pages, downloading content, attending webinars, and as part of using Appical’s services, Appical will be processing your personal data based on legitimate interest. One of Appical's legitimate interests is the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Appical may use your personal data to provide relevant content to you through direct marketing on social media platforms and emails, webpages or in a Appical service, based on your preferences. The personal data processed are aggregated details about you such as IP address, interests (where you have clicked, etc.), username and device. This is done through technologies like cookies and is called profiling. Appical will also be able to combine this information with information about the customer relationship we may have with your company.
The purpose of the profiling is to deliver customised marketing to you, improve your user experience with our services / websites and deliver products that our customers are satisfied with. Appical's services are used as a tool for work-related purposes, and your behaviour in these tools says little about your personal life. No sensitive data is processed. Your personal data is therefore processed from a business perspective in a way that we believe does not conflict with your freedoms and privacy rights as an individual.
Appical uses email as a tool to communicate marketing, however only if you have consented in accordance with national marketing legislation (if needed). If you have consented, you will always have the possibility to opt out as described below, or when you receive an email containing marketing.

support@appical.net
.
