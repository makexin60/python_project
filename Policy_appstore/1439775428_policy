1. What personal information we are processing, why and on which legal basis
1.1 Processing related to our EV charging solutions

– If you leave us, or one of our business partners leaves us your personal information (via website, e-mail, phone, in person or any other means) because you are interested in our products and/or services, we store your request and use that personal information to reach out to you, so that we can supply you with a quotation for the products and/or services of your interest.
The legal basis for this processing activity is that we take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, or your consent.
We may transfer this information to one of our business partners, if we deem this partner can better service you; in this case your personal information is processed under this business partner’s privacy policy.
Purchasing an EVBox charging station or accessory
– We use the personal information you provide us with to deliver the product and, if part of our agreement, to provide associated services (e.g. installation). We might share this information with business partners we use for the performance of these services. This processing activity is necessary to perform our contract with you.

- Registration is necessary so that we can provide you with the agreed charging management service(s). The personal information that we process for this purpose:
A unique charge card number;
A unique charging station number;

Additionally, we use your charging station number to provide you with regular firmware updates to keep your charging station secure.
This processing activity is necessary to perform our contract with you.
1.2 Processing related to general other interactions with us
Billing & administration
- For any payable service, we will use the personal information that you provide us with to invoice you. We will also use that personal information to maintain an up-to-date administration. This processing activity is necessary to perform the contract with you (invoicing) and to comply with a legal obligation (keeping an administration).
Contact with you
- When you contact us, e.g. through one of the contact forms on our website, if you call us for support, we contact you, e.g. to inform you about certain updates, or in case we have ongoing business with each other, we use your personal data for our ongoing business and to answer your requests, e.g. provide you with support. The legal basis for this processing activity is that we either have a contract with you, or that we take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.
Due diligence, security of our offerings and preventing fraud – As we aim to provide you with products and services that are most secure and as we want to keep our people and business safe, we have a legitimate interest to use your personal information to conduct due diligence investigations, to maintain the security of our offerings and to prevent fraud.
Legal purposes
- Sometimes we need to use your personal information to handle claims, to comply with applicable laws or law enforcement requests. This processing activity is in our legitimate interest, or to comply with a legal obligation.
Marketing and promotions
- If you have consented to receive communications from us, or if you are an EVBox partner or customer, we may contact you for the promotion of our own similar products and/or services, to invite to events we may organize, and to inform you about latest news and updates. The legal basis for this processing activity is either your consent, or our legitimate interest. You can easily opt-out of this service by clicking the unsubscribe button provided in our promotional emails or contacting
dataprivacy@evbox.com
.
Online surveys
- At times we may ask you to participate in a survey that allows us to improve our offerings. In such case, we use the information you provide us only for that purpose, and we might share it with our survey partner for the same purpose.
Quality improvement
- Log-files of connected charging stations contain valuable information for us to improve the quality of our offerings. We use the information contained in those log-files for that purpose. The personal information that we process for this purpose are service data of charging stations that are connected to our platform and charging sessions of EV-drivers that use such charging stations within the EVBox network. The legal basis for this processing activity is that it is in our legitimate interest, because we aim for constant improvement of our offerings and to that extent, it is critical for us to have the opportunity to use these statistical data.
Recruitment and onboarding
– If you apply for one of our positions, we process your personal information to assess if you are suitable for such position. The legal basis for this processing activity is that it is in our legitimate interest, as we need to assess how you can help us to accelerate the transition towards a zero-emission future. The personal information that we process for this purpose:
Background check information from public authorities;
Character and/or performance information from referees;
Pre-employment assessment information from assessment service providers;
Personal information from the public section of your social media account(s), or other public information about you; and
Personal information that you provide us with.
We will only use the personal information about you if such is necessary and relevant to the position you apply for.
In the application process we will ask you if we can also contact you for any upcoming employment opportunity for which you may be suitable, and thus keep your personal information on file for a period of one year. You can refuse and/or withdraw your consent at any time.
In case your application is successful, we have a legitimate interest to continue to process your personal information so that we can make you an offer, and subject to your acceptance, enter into an employment relationship with you and welcome you aboard.
2. Who do we share your personal information with?
EVBox is a company that operates on a global level and we may have a legitimate interest to share personal information with group companies, for example to a group company that is providing a service for another group company.
We also use trusted service providers to provide certain services for us in relation to the processing of your personal information. For example, we store personal information with an external hosting provider and we use a payment service provider to facilitate ad-hoc payments.
In addition, we may share your personal information with our business partners, for example your eMSP if you charge at an EVBox charging station with your eMSP’s charge card, a support service provider who manages service incidents, or a reseller to follow-up on your request for information on our products.
Finally, to the extent we are required by law, regulation or court order, we may disclose your personal information in compliance with that law, regulation, or court order.
3. International transfers
We may transfer your personal information to a group company or third party that is located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. If this country does not provide for an adequate level of protection under its domestic law according to the European Commission, we have ensured this adequate level of protection by agreeing on additional appropriate safeguards with that group company or third party through the Standard Data Protection Clauses adopted by the European Commission.
A list of countries that have ensured an adequate level of protection according to the European Commission can be found on the
EU Commission website.
Alternatively, we may ask you for your explicit consent to the proposed transfer. You may request a copy of the Standard Data Protection Clauses by sending us an email (details provided below), motivating your request.
4. For how long do we keep your personal information?
Where possible, we have set specific retention periods for keeping your personal information. These specific retention periods are stated below, or we shall communicate these to you at or before we start processing your personal information.
Where it is not possible for us to use set retention periods, we have stated below the criteria that we use to determine the retention periods.
