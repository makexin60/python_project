Privacy Policy
Nextivity Privacy Policy
Effective Date: February 28, 2025
This Privacy Policy applies to data collection and usage on all Nextivity websites and related services (including, without limitation, any Nextivity mobile application) (collectively, the “Services”).
Personal information of all users of the Services is collected, used and disclosed by us as described in this Privacy Policy, including the following:
What personal information we collect and how we use it;
With whom we share your personal information;
Retention and security of your information;
How you can manage your personal information;
Your rights, choices and disclosures, including those for Europe and California;
Users outside the United States;
Scope of Privacy Policy and links to other sites;
Privacy Policy updates; and
Contact Information.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the treatment, collection, use or disclosure of personal information by companies that we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.
1. Personal information we collect and how we use it
We collect personal information about you that you provide us. The personal information that may be gathered includes your name, telephone number(s), street address, mailing address and e-mail address. You may also be asked to furnish other information about yourself such as your job category, industry type, company name and job title, and/or the number of people in your company. Nextivity sells our products and services through distributors and resellers, and accordingly, we may receive your information from our distributors and resellers. If you create an account on our Services, we may ask for a username and password. In some cases, your email address may be your username.
When using your mobile device to visit, access or use the Service, then additional categories of information that we collect may include:
Your name associated with your mobile device
Your telephone number associated with your mobile device
Your geolocation
Your mobile device ID information
Nextivity collects and uses your personal information in connection with the Services to: deliver the products and services you have requested;  register your Nextivity product; create and manage your account on our Services; seek feedback in our online surveys; provide product information; respond to your inquiries; respond to  a request for contact from a Nextivity representative; provide or enhance the Services; provide customer support and maintenance; perform our contractual obligations; provide updates and other important information related to your activity on and with the Services; send you marketing communications; inform you of new services or changes in Services; fill employment positions; enter into contracts for services; fulfill legal obligations we have to governmental authorities or other third parties; and for other legitimate business purposes.
Please note that Nextivity may contact you about matters pertaining to your ownership of Nextivity products, or your interactive use of the company’s website(s) (e.g., access to download new product software releases). If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to support@nextivityinc.com
From time to time our interactions with you will be conducted over the telephone or video-conference, and such telephone calls and video conferences may be recorded.
If you inquire about a career at Nextivity through our website’s careers page, you will be asked to provide information about yourself, including contact information and your resume. We utilize a third-party provider to host our job applications and assist with the application process, and such provider has its own terms of use and privacy policies; and we encourage you to review those policies whenever you visit its website or interact with its platform. We will use the personal information of job applicants solely for employment evaluation purposes. Providing this information is completely voluntary.
Please do not submit to us any sensitive personal information.
Whenever you interact with the Services, we automatically receive and record information from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookies” information, the type of browser you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested.
We use Google Analytics which uses cookies to identify the frequency of use of certain areas of our website and to identify preferences. For more information regarding how Google collects, uses and shares your information, please visit
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
. The information regarding your use of this website that is generated by the cookie is transferred to a Google server in the United States and stored there. Google will use this information to analyze your use of the Services, compile reports on activity for us, and perform further services associated with website use and Internet use. Google may also transmit this information to third parties where required by law or to the extent that third parties process these data on behalf of Google. You can deactivate Google Analytics using a browser add-on if you do not wish the analysis to take place. You can download the add-on here:  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
We operate social media pages on third party networks and have social media icons on our website. When you visit or link to our social media pages, data is processed both by us and the applicable social media provider. Social media providers are unaffiliated with us, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of social media providers.  Social media providers have their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review those policies whenever you visit their websites or interact with their platforms.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at
support@nextivityinc.com
.
In certain cases, we may share some of your personal information with third parties as described below.
2. Sharing personal information
We share personal information with our vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. These parties include:
Staff augmentation and contract personnel
Distributors and resellers
Hosting service providers and other technology providers
Telecommunications operators (as described below)
Job hosting provider
Professional advisors
We share personal information with our affiliates or other members of our corporate family.
We also share personal information when necessary to complete a transaction initiated or authorized by you or provide you with a product or service you have requested. In addition to those set forth above, these parties also include:
Other users (where you post information publicly or as otherwise necessary to effect a transaction initiated or authorized by you through the Services)
Third party business partners who you access through the Services
Other parties authorized by you
We also share personal information when we believe it is necessary to:
Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies
Protect us, our business or our users, for example to enforce our terms of service, prevent spam or other unwanted communications and investigate or protect against fraud
Maintain the security of our products and services
We also share information with third parties when you give us consent to do so.
Telecommunications operators such as AT&T or T-Mobile (an “Operator”) may be required under applicable law (for example, 47 CFR 20.21(h) in the United States) to register users of a Nextivity Product. If, through the Services, you choose to (i) register your Nextivity Product with an Operator or (ii) create an account on  the Services, then we may disclose information you provide to us in connection with such registration or account creation or your geolocation information based on the use of your Nextivity Product to such Operator or its affiliates or the distributors or resellers through which you purchased a Nextivity Product (collectively, “Distributors”). For example, we may disclose your name, physical address, email address, phone number, fax number, geolocation of your Nextivity Product, and/or Nextivity Product device ID to such Operators. Also, if you purchased your Nextivity Product through an authorized Nextivity distributor (“Distributor”), then we may also share the foregoing information with such Distributor. We have no control over the policies and practices of Operators or Distributors as to privacy, their use or disclosure of your personal information, or anything else. So if you choose to register your Nextivity Product with an Operator or purchase your Nextivity Product through a Distributor, please review all of that Operator’s and/or Distributor’s relevant policies on privacy. For your information, and without limiting what an Operator or Distributor may do with your personal information, please recognize that Operators and Distributors may be required to disclose your personal information in accordance with applicable law. By submitting personal information to us in connection with the registration of a Nextivity Product or by creating an account on the Services, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, you agree to hold Nextivity harmless against any disclosure, use, or security of such personal information by an Operator, Distributor or their agents.
We may choose to buy or sell assets, and we may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, personal information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We are based in the United States, and accordingly we may process and store the information we collect from you in the United States. By providing your personal information to us in connection with the Services, you consent to the transfer to and the processing of such information in the United States. We will use the information you provide to monitor the operating conditions of your Nextivity product. If at any time you wish us to stop monitoring your Nextivity product, please contact us at support@nextivityinc.com.
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Nextivity, our employees, our users, or others.
We may anonymize your personal information so that you are not individually identified and provide that information to our partners or other third parties. We may also use your personal information on an aggregated basis to improve our products, services, and offerings.
3. Retention and security of your personal information
We retain personal information about you for five years after the purchase of one of our products. In some cases we retain personal information for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may retain email addresses indefinitely, or for so long as permitted under applicable law, for purposes of marketing communications.
We seek to protect personal information using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of personal information and applicable processing activity. For example, access to all personal information is limited to individuals with a need to know and personal information is stored in an encrypted form.
4. Managing personal information
You may contact Nextivity via e-mail at
support@nextivityinc.com
and we will attempt to assist you to remove, review, or revise any or all personal information that you have previously provided to us.
You may opt out of receiving electronic marketing communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link on the communication or contacting us at

You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below. For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email support@nextivityinc.com. Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.
