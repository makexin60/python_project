YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE WHICH WILL BIND YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE, WE ARE UNWILLING TO LICENCE THE LICENCED APPLICATION TO YOU AND YOU MUST REFRAIN FROM USING THE APPLICATION.
KEY POINTS
The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by us.
Road information prevails
. The information provided by the Service is not intended to replace the information provided on the road, such as travel direction, time based restrictions, lane restrictions, road blockades, traffic signs, traffic lights, police instructions, etc.
‍
Cautious driving
. Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to send traffic updates (such as updates on road accidents and traffic congestion), or to non-verbally interact with the Service or use the Service in a non-verbal manner for any purpose other than navigation while driving. Traffic updates or non-verbal reports you want to submit to the Service may only be sent after you have stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. Alternatively, such updates may be sent by a passenger other than the driver, provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.
‍
Non-continuous updates

. Some features of the Service make use of detailed location and route information, for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your mobile device on which the application is installed and activated. These features cannot be provided without utilising this technology. Please note, as described in detail in the Privacy Policy:
We use your location and route information to create a detailed route history of all of your journeys made when using the Service. We use this history to offer the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Service it offers to you and to all of its users, to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data, and more as described in detail in the Privacy Policy. This history is associated with your account. This history is private to you and is not shared in any way.
We allow you to use the Service whether or not you choose to set up an account for yourself. If you choose to use the Service without setting up an account you may do so. We will still link all of your information with      your account and a unique identifier generated by us in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

Information security
Navmii considers information security to be a top priority. Navmii services are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. Navmii implements systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimise the risk of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorised access or use of information. For example, we review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorised access to our systems. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Navmii employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.
However, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance. Therefore, although Navmii takes great efforts to protect your personal information, Navmii cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that Navmii’s databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
