Methodology
Kal Admin provides you with database funtionality needed for all
										stages of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Data Dictionary
Kal Admin's Data Dictionary is a repository where Business Analysts store definitions and descriptions of data elements required to satisfy end user requirement.
										Business terminology can be stored in the Dictionary as well.
										The Dictionary is used later for building tables in the database.
Tables Design
Using Kal Admin, tables can be defined without actually building them in the database. Columns in the table are defined
										using the Data Dictionary. Once the defined tables pass quality assurance
									    you can build them in the database with a click.
Documentation
Instead of having vital information stored somewhere in a Word document have it readily accessible by using Kal Admin's documentation.
										Every object in the database can be documented. Table columns can be described as well as the business rules
										applied to them. Columns whose content is code can be linked to the lookup table that translate the code to text.
