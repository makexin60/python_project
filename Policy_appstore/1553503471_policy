How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
We keep your Personal Data for as long as needed for the purpose we collected it and in accordance with our data retention policies. For specific retention periods for each use of your Personal Data, refer to
this
section.
We retain and use your Personal Data as required to meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and policies. If we use your data for multiple purposes, we keep it until the purpose with the longest retention period expires, discontinuing use for shorter periods. Our retention periods align with our business needs and industry standards.
International Transfers of Your Personal Data
Our company is based in the USA, and our service providers operate globally. When your Personal Data is safeguarded by EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation, before sending it to parties outside the European Economic Area or the UK, we will do one of two things:
Seek your consent
; or
Demand privacy and security:
We will ensure the third party maintains the same level of privacy and security for your data as we do.
We are accountable for the protection of your Personal Data when we transfer it to others. We use safeguards like the
Data Privacy Framework
or the
Standard Contractual Clauses
(also known as the “SCCs”) approved by the European Commission under
Article 46.2 of the GDPR
. In some cases, the authorities of a country may have determined that the laws of other countries provide a level of protection equivalent to domestic law. You can see
here
the list of countries that the European Commission recognized as providing an adequate level of protection to personal data, and
here
the list of countries recognized by the UK.
What Privacy Rights Do You Have?
You have specific rights regarding your Personal Data that we collect and process. In this section, we first describe those rights and then we explain
how you can exercise those rights
.
Right to Know What Happens to Your Personal Data
This is also known as the right to be informed. It means that you can ask you for all the information about how we handle your Personal Data. This includes, for example, how we collect and use it, how long we will keep it, and who it will be shared with, among other things.
We are informing you of how we process your Personal Data with this Notice.
We will make every effort to let you know how we use your Personal Data. Yet, if we did not get your data directly from you, the GDPR does not require us to inform you in these cases: (1) When it is impossible or too costly to provide the information. (2) When the law obliges us to gather or share the data. (3) If the Personal Data must stay confidential because of professional or other secrecy obligations.
Right to Know What Personal Data MacroFactor Has About You
This is called the right of access. This right allows you to (1) get confirmation of whether we process Personal Data about you (2) ask for full details of the Personal Data we hold about you; (3) get a copy or access to the Personal Data,
Once we receive and confirm that the request came
from you
or
your authorized agent
, you can ask us for:
The categories of your processed Personal Data.
The categories of sources for your Personal Data.
Our purposes for processing your Personal Data.
Where possible, the retention period for your Personal Data, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine the retention period.
The categories of third parties with whom we share your Personal Data.
Details on automated decision-making and its implications.
The specific pieces of Personal Data we process about you in a shareable format.
Disclosure details if we sold or disclosed your data.
Specific legitimate interests if we rely on them for processing.
The appropriate safeguards used to transfer Personal Data from the EEA or the UK to a third country, if applicable.
To obtain a copy of your data, go to
Data & Privacy
and select
Generate Spreadsheet
. Note that we are working on adding all types of Personal Data to the spreadsheets.
Under some circumstances, we may deny your access request and provide for the denial.
For security and legal compliance, we cannot disclose certain sensitive information like Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, financial account numbers, health insurance or medical IDs, passwords, or security questions and answers. However, we can inform you if we have such information without disclosing specific details.
Right to Change Your Personal Data
This is called the right to rectification. It gives you the right to ask us to correct without undue delay anything that you think is wrong with the Personal Data we have on file about you, and to complete any incomplete Personal Data.
If you are having trouble changing the information yourself in your
Profile
tab or editing your entries, please
contact us
and we will do our best to change the Personal Data for you or help you edit it yourself.
Right to Delete Your Personal Data
This is called the right to erasure, right to deletion, or the right to be forgotten. This right means you can ask for your Personal Data to be deleted. To delete your account and data, go to
Data & Privacy
and select
Delete Your Account
. This will not cancel your subscription, which you can manage through your phone’s app store.
Sometimes we can delete your information, but other times it is not possible for either technical or legal reasons. If that is the case,
we will consider if we can limit how we use it
. We will also inform you of our reason for denying your deletion request.
Right to Ask Us to Limit How We Process Your Personal Data
This is called the right to restrict processing. It is the right to ask us to only use or store your Personal Data for certain purposes. You have this right in certain instances, such as where you believe the data is inaccurate or the processing activity is unlawful.
Right to Ask Us to Stop Using Your Personal Data
This is called the right to object. This is your right to tell us to stop using your Personal Data. You may have this right where we rely on a legitimate interest of ours (or of a third party).
You may also object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes
. If you receive a mass email from us and no longer wish to receive communications, simply look for the “Unsubscribe” option at the bottom of the email.
We will stop processing the relevant Personal Data unless: (i) we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, or freedoms; or (ii) we need to continue processing your Personal Data to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.
Right to Port or Move Your Personal Data
This is called the right to data portability. It is the right to ask for and receive a portable copy of your Personal Data that you have given us or that you have generated by using our services, so that you can:
Move it;
Copy it;
Keep it for yourself; or
Transfer it to another organization.
We will provide your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. When you request this information electronically, we will provide you a copy in electronic format.
To obtain a copy of your data, go to
Data & Privacy
and select
Generate Spreadsheet
. Note that we are working on adding all types of Personal Data to the spreadsheets.
Right Related to Automated Decision Making
We sometimes use computers to study your Personal Data. We might use this Personal Data so we know how you use our services. For decisions that may seriously impact you, you have the right not to be subject to automatic decision-making, including profiling. But in those cases, we will always explain to you when we might do this, why it is happening, and the effect.
Right to Withdraw Your Consent
Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your Personal Data, you may withdraw your consent at any time. In most cases, this will mean deleting your entry from your profile. If you withdraw your consent, our use of your Personal Data before you withdraw is still lawful.
If you have given consent for your details to be shared with a third party and wish to withdraw this consent, please also contact the relevant third party in order to change your preferences.
Generally, you will just need to delete the entry or profile information to withdraw your consent.
Right to Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless the applicable data protection laws permit it, we will not:
Deny you goods or services;
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
How Can You Exercise Your Privacy Rights?
To exercise any of the rights described above, please submit a request by either:
Contacting us by email at privacy@macrofactorapp.com; or
Contacting our support team within the app;
Verifying Your Identity
In order to correctly respond to your privacy rights requests, we need to confirm that YOU made the request. Consequently, we may require additional information to confirm that you are who you say you are.
If you submit requests through your password-protected accounts, your identity is already confirmed. However, for requests sent through other methods, we will verify your identity by asking a few questions.
We will only use the Personal Data you provide us in a request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
Verification of Authority
If you are making a request on someone else’s behalf, we need to verify your authority to act for them. Please provide proof that the individual authorized you to make this request. This can include:
Signed permission from the individual.
A valid power of attorney.
Proof of parental responsibility or legal guardianship.
Alternatively, you may ask the individual to directly
contact us
by using the contact details above to verify their identity with MacroFactor and confirm with us that they gave you permission to submit this request
Response Timing and Format of Our Responses
We aim to acknowledge the receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. In this communication, we will describe our identity verification process (if required) and provide an estimated response time, unless the request has already been approved or denied.
Please allow us up to a month to reply to your requests from the day we received your request. If we need more time (up to 90 days in total), we will inform you of the reason and the extension period in writing.
If we cannot satisfy a request, we will explain why in our response.
We will not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests. However, if we find that your request is excessive, repetitive, or groundless, we may charge a fee. In such cases, we will explain the reason for the fee and provide a cost estimate before proceeding.
Privacy of Children
The MacroFactor app is not directed at, or intended for use by, children under the age of thirteen.
Data Integrity & Security
We are strongly committed to keeping your Personal Data safe. We have implemented and will maintain technical, administrative, and physical measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized processing. Unauthorized processing includes unauthorized access, exfiltration, theft, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Some of those measures include encryption, access control measures, and we also have dedicated teams to look after privacy. However, it is important to note that we cannot guarantee full security if you continue to use a deprecated version of the app. To ensure the best protection for your Personal Data, we recommend keeping your app up-to-date.
Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority
If the EU or the UK General Data Protection apply to our processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you are not satisfied with how we process your Personal Data.
Specifically, you can lodge a complaint in the Member State of the European Union of your habitual residence, place of work, or the alleged violation of the GDPR. In the UK, you can lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
