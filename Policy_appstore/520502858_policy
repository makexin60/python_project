Privacy Policy
Introduction
At Low Lag Labs we help mobile apps provide users with better connectivity and in-app experience on wireless networks (because nobody likes laggy internet). We work with mobile applications to improve mobile experiences that rely on connectivity.
Wireless network performance insights that improve mobile experiences are the foundation of our business, and we adopt a privacy-first approach when we handle any data from your device.
This privacy policy will inform you how we handle data collected from your device when you opt-in to data sharing through a mobile application operated by one of our app partners.
As further detailed below, Low Lag Labs does not collect any personal information that directly identifies individuals, and our products and services do not permit or require user identification.  Low Lag Labs does not sell personal data.
Data Collection
We collect data relating to wireless network performance to help answer questions such as:
What connectivity issues are mobile apps and their users experiencing?
Where and why are those issues happening?
How can those issues be resolved, and wireless network experience be improved?
Each App Partner (defined as a mobile application that satisfies our privacy requirements and integrates the Low Lag Labs Software Development Kit, or SDK) independently controls when the Low Lag Labs SDK is enabled to collect data. We mandate that our App Partners provide transparent disclosures to end-users, and that they only start our SDK after users opt-in. We audit our application partners to ensure that these requirements are being satisfied.
As part of our privacy-first approach, our SDK does not collect advertising ID, name, email, phone number, social media ID, contact list, or anything else which directly identifies an individual or their particular device. If and where the consent and disclosure requirements are met, our SDK may collect the following types of data:
Categories and Examples
Categories
Location
Device Information
Connection Details
Connection Quality
Usage Data
Identifiers
Crash Logs and Diagnostics
Information fromEnvironmental Sensors
Examples
GPS coordinates or similar information from the mobile device
Device hardware model, manufacturer, cellular radio model, sub-component manufacturers, and capabilities (e.g., CPU cores); mobile platform version; custom ROMs or Android skins
Network type, network operator, cellular and Wi-Fi signal strength and quality, identifiers of connected cell towers and Wi-Fi routers (BSSID, SSID)
Data flow speed measured both passively (monitoring movement through mobile apps) and actively (tests that download/upload data within the SDK)
Information on data usage flow, but not the content itself; monitoring of how fast data moves through apps or is actively tested during data download/upload
IP address, Resettable ID (unique to each installation of a mobile app, specific to Low Lag Labs, and generated for each new app installation or device reset)
Environmental sensors data such as acceleration, orientation, atmospheric pressure, light intensity, internal device conditions (e.g., battery temperature, voltage)
Data collected from sensors (if available on the device), including for example, acceleration, orientation, atmospheric pressure, light intensity, and internal conditions (e.g., battery temperature,voltage)
‍
Typical Uses of Categories of Information
Location - Understanding the wireless network quality where your device is located and providing suggestions to get better signal.
Device Information - Wireless device details are required to identify if specific network issues are limited to a device type or indoor/outdoor environments.
Connection Details - Used to separate data and results by operator and compare their performance, and congestion.
Connection Quality - Used to evaluate the performance of wireless networks to see if your device was experiencing poor signal coverage.
‍
The state of this application during a network test (e.g. “in use”), and information about how the SDK and app are used such as session duration, may be collected for data validation purposes. Low Lag Labs does not receive, see, or record any content viewed by users.
When a mobile application containing our SDK is installed and consent is provided, our software generates a unique identification code ("Resettable ID") for that specific installation instance rather than the device itself. Each mobile app on a particular device will generate a different, unique Resettable ID. Additionally, new installations of the same mobile app will also create new unique ResettableIDs. These Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, and never sold or shared with third parties. To further manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, which can help identify the telecom carrier network being accessed and impacting your experience.
We collect and send Crash Logs and Diagnostics data to help ensure that our software does not negatively impact your experience. Diagnostics data that we collect and send may include information about the performance of the app on the device. For example, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, or any technical diagnostics. Diagnostics data may be used for analytics, fraud prevention, security, or compliance purposes.
The goal of collecting the above data is to measure the experience you have of wireless networks.
The information from environmental sensors on your device (depending on which ones are integrated in your device), allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the atmospheric pressure and light intensity. Measurements on internal device conditions, such as battery temperature and voltage, help us understand how instantaneous device conditions affect the experience of wireless networks.
Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to create a detailed picture of the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time.
This privacy policy does not encompass or detail Low Lag Labs’s handling of internal employee or customer data. Our employees and customers may provide additional personal information such as contacts, names, email addresses, and phone numbers through the regular course of business and our non-public facing policies, which are available to those groups, govern the handling of that data.
If you contact us through
lowlaglabs.com/contact
or otherwise submit personal information via our website, insofar as permitted under applicable law, we may retain the information provided for our records and use it to respond to your inquiry, communicate with you in relation to our services, and/or otherwise process your request.
Purpose of Data Collection
We collect and process the data described in this privacy policy to support the following services (“Services”):
Help our App Partners understand how connectivity is affecting user experience;
Help provide actionable steps to App Partners for them to improve performance; and
Support the creation of depersonalized and/or aggregated insights and reports for telecom ecosystem companies to understand and improve connectivity.

These third parties are required to manage the information exclusively for our benefit and not for their own purposes.
3.
Business Transactions.
In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset sale, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, or similar transaction, or a change in ownership of our business, we may share or transfer databases containing certain data to the relevant parties involved in the transaction.

Under the CCPA, “sell” means sell, rent, release, disclose, disseminate, make available, transfer, or otherwise communicate orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. The law contains exceptions to this definition which may limit how we respond to a request by you. To exercise this right to opt out, you may call us at (+44) 020 3290 8047 or email us at

In addition, there are, consistent with relevant laws, limitations on our ability to honor requests to exercise these rights for data that cannot be linked to a verified request, such as where data has been depersonalized, or whether there are other relevant exceptions under California law.
We do not provide a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information, because in the event that we collect certain sensitive personal information, we do not use it to infer characteristics such that we would be required to provide a right to limit.
To the extent that anything in this Section conflicts with this Privacy Policy, this Section shall govern.
