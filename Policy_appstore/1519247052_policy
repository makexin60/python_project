Data Privacy Notice
Data Privacy Notice
The new General Data Protection Regulation, commonly referred to as ‘GDPR’, came into effect on 23 May 2023.  ‘GDPR’ is a new EU initiated regulation to strengthen data privacy of citizens.  In particular, it aims to give individuals more rights, control and understanding of how their personal data is processed.
Data protection has always been a priority for us at St Raphael’s Garda Credit Union Limited and keeping the data you entrust to us secure, is a core part of our business.  These new regulations are designed to increase the level of transparency in how personal data is managed, and the credit union wholeheartedly embraces this.  As part of the new regulations, we are obliged to inform you of the following:
The types of data we collect on you;
The purpose your data is used for; and
Your rights in relation to how your data is processed.
To do this, we have developed a new Data Privacy Notice.  This sets out in more detail how your data is treated and managed within the credit union to support the provision of services for you.
