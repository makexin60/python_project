Privacy is a Fundamental Human Right.
That's it. That's the manifesto. We don't care about your private info. We don't sell it, and our business model has nothing to do with it.
Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what data we do collect, what we don't, and how we keep you secure while you use our app.
What data do we collect?
To put it short and sweet, we collect no data whatsoever.
