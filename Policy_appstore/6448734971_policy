Skoot Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Skoot”, “we”, or “us”) care about privacy and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use, process, and disclose your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices in connection with our websites and applications that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”) and our offline interactions with you in settings where we post this Privacy Policy.

Personal information we collect
We collect three categories of personal information - personal information you give us; personal information automatically collected from your use of the Services; and personal information from third-party sources.
​
Personal information you give us
Account data. When you register for an account with us, we require certain personal information to open your account, such as your name, email address, and password.
​
Profile data. We may also ask you to provide additional profile information to use certain features of the Services which may include street addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license number, date of issuance and issuing country and/or state, profile photos, employer, city, school, biography, and date of birth. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile photos, employer, city, school, and biography) are part of your public profile page and will be publicly visible to others.
​
Vehicle data. We collect information you provide in relation to a vehicle such as vehicle listing details, vehicle identification number (VIN), availability dates, reviews, and uploaded trip photos.
​
Payment data. We collect your digital payment details, bank account, payment card numbers and/or crypto details, and transaction information in connection with a potential or actual transaction, which may be processed and stored by one or more third party payment service providers or digital payments companies.
​
Identity verification data. In some instances, we may collect identity verification information such as a photograph or scanned copy of a passport, national ID card, or payment card, social media account information, or other forms of identification information. Where we request that you withhold certain information (such as obscuring or redacting aspects of identification information), please do so.
​
Communications. When you communicate with Skoot, including via phone, email, or chat, or use the Services to communicate with other users, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.
​
Personal information we automatically collect.
Usage data. We collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches, bookings you have made, how long you spent on a page or screen, sites from which you link or browse to in the Services, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access time, duration of access, and other actions on the Services.
​
Location data. When you use certain features of the Services, we may collect information about your approximate location (e.g., city/town associated with your IP address). When you opt in to use our location sharing feature, we may collect the precise location information of your mobile device. Keep in mind that most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services by any application on your mobile device in the device’s settings menu.
Device data. We collect information about your computer or mobile device, such as its operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, unique device identifiers, or general location information such as city, province, or geographic area.
​
Trip data. We collect transactional information related to the trips you take through the Services, including the date and time of your trip, amounts charged, and other related trip details.
​
Cookies and similar technology. When you access the Services, we (including companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, clear gifs, pixel tags, e-tags, “Flash cookies”, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively “Cookies”). At this time, we do not respond to browser ‘Do-Not-Track’ signals.
Personal information we collect from third-party sources.
Third-party services. If you choose to log in to our Services through a third-party site or service (e.g., Apple, Facebook, or Google), the third-party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. The information we may receive varies by service and is controlled by the relevant service. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Skoot account and authorizing Skoot to have access to this information, you agree that Skoot may collect, store, and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for how those third parties use and share your information. Please refer to the privacy policies of those third parties to understand how they use and share your personal information.
​
Background check services. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, Skoot may collect background information about you from public records, background check providers, or other screening services, including credit reports and information about criminal convictions or from sex offender registries. We may use your information, including your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports.
​
Other sources. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, fraud detection information, or data from credit bureaus and other third-party data providers.
We may combine the information about you that we receive from third-party sources with other information we have about you.

Send you service, support, and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and information requested by you at any telephone number, by placing a voice call or through text (SMS) or email messaging

For research and development:
We may use your personal information to analyze and improve the Services and to develop new products and services, including by studying our user demographics of the Services. We may also create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data from your personal information. We make personal information into anonymous data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Services and promote our business.
For marketing and advertising:
We and our third party advertising partners may collect and use your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes:
​
Direct marketing. We may send you Skoot-related marketing communications as permitted by law. You will have the ability to opt-out of our marketing and promotional communications.
​
Interest-based advertising. We may contract with third party advertising and social media companies to display ads on the Services and other sites. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about you (including the device data, online activity data, and/or geolocation data described above) over time across our Services and other sites and services or your interaction with our emails, and use that information to serve ads that they think will interest you. These ads are known as “interest-based advertisements”. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising, in the Interest-based advertising choices section below.
​
For security and safety, including to:
Verify your identity or authenticate information that you provide, including during account creation and password reset processes
Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems
Detect, prevent, and/or remediate fraud, abuse, security incidents, or other potentially harmful, prohibited, or illegal activities

​
To comply with law:

​
With your consent:
In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to process your personal information.
We may also use your personal information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.
​
How we disclose your personal information
​
With your consent
We may share your information at your direction or with your consent.
​
Profiles, listings, and other public information
Your public listing page on the Services will always include some basic information, such as your user ID or name associated with your account, your public profile photo, and for partners, the city where your car is located, your listing description, your calendar availability, transaction related information to allow our community to evaluate your reliability and responsiveness, and reviews or feedback about you. Your public listing page may also include aggregate demand information (such as number of page views over a period of time) and information about your cancellations. The Services may also display the approximate geographic pick-up location of your vehicle.
​
The Services allow your public profile and public listing pages to be included in search engines, in which case your public profile and public listing pages may be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results.
​
Sharing between partners and renters
Skoot enables car owners to offer and share their vehicles with other individuals. If you agree to a booking through the Services, we may provide your information to the other party in that transaction as reasonably necessary to facilitate the transaction. For example, Skoot may provide your mobile phone number to facilitate communication, your driver's license information to confirm license validity, or your photograph to facilitate identification. We will also share the address of the vehicle and, if applicable, the proposed delivery location with the other party. If you used the Trip Photo feature, we may share the trip photos you upload and associated captions with the other party. The other party may also send you text messages (such as to confirm pickup or delivery location).
​
Service providers
We may share information with vendors and service providers who support the operation of the Services and business and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us (including, for example, web hosting, analytics, payment processing, email delivery, marketing, insurance, claims administration, and customer support services). In some cases, the service provider may directly collect the information from you on our behalf. For partners who choose to use our photography program, your contact information will be shared with the photographer assigned to shoot your vehicle. These service providers may use your personal information only as directed or authorized by us.
​
Third-party platforms and social media networks
If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network (such as by logging in to the Services using your account with the third party, providing your API key or similar access token for the Services to a third party, or otherwise linking your Services account to a third-party’s services), we may disclose to the third-party platform or social media network the personal information necessary to facilitate the connection or that you authorized us to share. We do not control the third party’s use of your personal information.
​
Professional advisors
We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.
​

We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your personal information, in connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.
​
Responding to legal requests, preventing harm, and protecting our rights
We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or tax authorities, or third parties. We will make such disclosure to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by applicable law or where we consider such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations or legal process, to respond to claims asserted against us, and for the security and safety purposes described above. We may also disclose your information in response to valid legal requests relating to criminal investigations or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose Skoot, you, or any other user, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Skoot, our users, or others.
​
We may also disclose your personal information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.

​
Choosing not to share your personal information
Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the Services to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or we later delete it at your request), we may not be able to provide you with the Services.
​
Third-party platforms and social media networks
If you choose to connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network, such as by using the third party’s authentication service to log into your account on the Services, you may be able to control your settings through the third-party platform or social media network. If you withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.
​
Security
We employ a number of technical, physical, and organizational measures designed to protect information against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration while it is under our control. However, no method of transmitting or storing information can be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
​
Other important information
Cross border transfer
The Services are controlled and operated from the Thailand. Your personal information may be used, stored, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. These locations may be outside of your state, province, or country of residence, and may have different and/or less protective data protection rules than those of your state, province, or country. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, regulatory agencies, security authorities, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to the laws in those jurisdictions.
​
Sensitive information
We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive information (e.g., Social Security numbers, social insurance numbers, passports, information related to racial or ethnic origin, or health) on or through the Services or otherwise to us unless specifically requested.
​
Children
The Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from users under the age of 18. If a child under the age of 18 has already provided us with personal information, his or her parent or guardian may contact us to request that we delete it.
​
Third-party privacy practices
This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information collected by Skoot. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third-party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.
​
Translations
