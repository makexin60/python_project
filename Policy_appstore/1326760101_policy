Content may not be used for any commercial purposes without our prior written consent.

Exclusions of liability
Nothing in these terms of use excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for our fraud, or excludes or limits our duties or any liability under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended, ("FSMA") or any conduct of business rules developed pursuant to FSMA.
We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the content of our website is accurate. We will also endeavour to correct any errors or omissions as soon as practicable after being notified of them. However, we are not responsible for any inaccuracies in content. We are not liable for any loss, distress or inconvenience caused by falls in the value of any investments. The value of investments can go down as well as up and you could get back less than you invest. The past is not a guide to future performance.
Financial projections
We will provide you with financial projections for the purpose of comparing investments and informing your financial plans. These projections shall:
Illustrate a likely range of outcomes based on the balance of probability.
Be prepared using well recognised actuarial techniques.
Be based on reasonable assumptions supported by objective data.
Incorporate the full impact of all charges.
The projections we provide are based on the balance of probability and the actual returns on your investments will usually be different. The "bad case" projection is not a "worse case" and there is a 1 in 6 chance that the actual returns on your investments will be worse than the "bad case" projection. We are not liable for any loss, distress or inconvenience caused when the actual returns on your investments are different to our projections.
Law
These terms of use will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law. There is no minimum duration for the contract.
