Tracking data collected through the use of the Service (the location (GPS), manner, means and duration of activities recorded by the Memory Tracker for Timely);
Other information the Data Subject may provide or input into the Service; and
Communications with the Data Subject relating to support requests or other inquiries from the Data Subject.
Timely does not intend to process special categories of personal data, such as data on racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
‍
Timely will only process such special categories of personal data as specified above at the request of the user, i.e., when the user submits such data to Timely at their own will.

Timely will only process such special categories of personal data following the informed, expressly and freely given consent of the Data Subject.
‍
The Memory Tracker for Timely for macOS and Windows do not have full access to everything going on inside your computer; it will only send basic information about the applications you are using. For example, if you have Google Chrome active on a website, they will send the current window title, which in most cases will be the name of the website, together with a timestamp and some information about what application the Timely software thinks it was. This is used to display the correct icon on your timeline.
‍
If you choose to use or connect to third-party integrations (e.g. Google Calendar, Trello etc.) through the Service, or if you are required or permitted to do so by a customer, such third parties may allow us to have access to and store additional information about your interaction with those services as it relates to your use of the Service.
If you initiate these connections, we will share information about you that is required to enable your use of the third-party integration through the Service. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not initiate these connections.
By enabling these connections, you authorise us to connect and access the information provided through these connections. The privacy policies of these third parties govern such connections. More information about each integration can be found on the respective support pages for

Apps distributed on Google Play are also subject to the
Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement
.
‍
Timely’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to
Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
‍
The Limited Use requirements have four elements:
Allowed Use
: Developers are only allowed to use restricted scope data to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent from the requesting app's user interface. It should be clear to your users why and how you use the restricted scope data they've chosen to share with you.
Allowed Transfer
: Developers are only allowed to transfer restricted scope data to others if that transfer is (a) necessary to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent from the requesting app's user interface, (b) to comply with applicable laws, or (c) a part of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets of the developer. All other transfers or sales of user data are completely prohibited.
Prohibited Advertising
: Developers are never allowed to use or transfer restricted scope data to serve users advertisements. This includes personalized, re-targeted and interest-based advertising.
Prohibited Human Interaction
: Developers cannot allow humans to read restricted scope user data. For example, a developer with access to a user's data is not allowed to have one of its employees read through a user's emails. There are four limited exceptions to this rule: (a) the developer obtains a user's consent to read specific messages (for example, for tech support), (b) it's necessary for security purposes (for example, investigating abuse), (c) to comply with applicable laws, and (d) the developer aggregates and anonymizes the data and only uses it for internal operations (for example, reporting aggregate statistics in an internal dashboard).

Common questions and answers
What type of information does Timely capture?
By itself, Timely doesn’t actively capture anything. You can choose to download our
Memory app
to automatically track the time you spend in web and desktop apps. Additionally, you can choose to connect
native integrations
to pull in information from the other apps you use at work. On our website, you can choose to accept or reject basic cookies that help us understand and improve your experience (
see our cookie policy
).
How does the Memory app work? What data does it collect?
The Memory app enables automatic time tracking in Timely. It doesn’t have full access to everything going on inside your computer; it only requests basic information about the applications you use—namely, page titles, file path and timestamps of apps you are actively using. Each individual activity—or “memory”— is then uploaded to your private timeline inside Timely, which only you can access. You need to download the Memory app to use it, and you control when you want to turn it “on” or “off”.
Here's an example of raw Memory data from time spent using Google Chrome:
{"id":null,"timestamp":"2017-07-18T09:08:51.000+02:00","app":"Google Chrome","window":"nl-classifier - API Reference | IBM Watson Developer Cloud","detail":"https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/#create_classifier","name":"ibm.com","detected_app":"Google Chrome"}
Read more on what Timely captures here
Can Memory track incognito website activity?
Memory can’t track time spent in “private” or “incognito” browser windows, unless you use Firefox (which, unfortunately, is built in a way that makes it impossible to block tracking). Memory doesn’t track the actual content of web pages or what you actually read, see, or write—it’s only built to record how long you actively spend on a specific website or application.
Do you take screenshots or track keystrokes?
Timely is not an employee monitoring software. We will never support employee screenshots, keystroke monitoring or any other invasive surveillance tactics. See our
Privacy Promise
for a slice of our thinking.
Can my boss or colleagues see my memories?
No. Your memories are completely private to you—only you can see your private activity timeline. Your colleagues and managers can only see the time entries you publicly log to your timesheet. Even if you link memories to a public time entry, they will remain private.
What do you use my data for?
Your memory data exists to help you minimize timesheet admin, create accurate invoices, and report transparently on all of your time. Our machine learning team only use encrypted, anonymized data sets to develop and improve our software. We don’t sell your data, or use it for marketing or advertising purposes. A carefully selected group of
sub-processors that we partner with
can require access to certain personal data. We only grant this when it is absolutely necessary to the provision of our service and only ever enter into fully GDPR-compliant data processing agreements.
What about Timely’s native integrations with third-party apps? What data is shared?
Timely’s native integrations let you pull information from other work apps, like email inboxes and calendars, into your private timeline. To do this, Timely requests limited access to third-party apps. Timely’s Gmail integration, for example, will record the subject line and a snippet (the first line from the email you worked on) to your private timeline to provide a detailed log of your daily communication. Timely can only access the basic information that Gmail allows, and never sends any of your private memory data to connected third-party apps.
Where and how do you store my data? Is it encrypted?
Your data is securely transferred and stored on IOS 27001-certified Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers in Europe. All communication between the server and your browser, mobile or desktop, and across our internal system, is encrypted using SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS), with an SSL certificate issued by Comodo. Our database is also completely encrypted.
‍
Amazon is one of the world's largest providers of hosting software; they spend massive resources on security and conduct ongoing risk and security assessments. In the web world, they're the safety standard. AWS is Privacy Shield-certified, so the transfer of data to it is in compliance with EU law. For the long read, check out their
security policies here
.
Can Timely employees see my data?
Only our Chief Data Protection Officer, Deputy Data Protection Officer (DPO) and Head of Growth can access the databases used to store information from Memory products. Connecting to the database is only possible from AWS EC2 instances created and monitored by our DPO. All data is protected by an internal auditing system (SQL audit logging) and DPO approval is required for database access (which is only granted as read-only). SQL audit logging captures the name of the individual accessing data, the purpose of access, the data accessed, the date and time of access and DPO approval. Individual developers can only access a subset of the tables for the data required to perform their tasks. Specific employees are only granted access to your account whenever we receive your permission to do so for troubleshooting, or any other needs that you request or require.
What about my passwords and card details?
Timely doesn’t process, store or transmit personal information (like your name, email, unique ID number or IP address). Card transactions are processed using Stripe’s bank-level security encryption, and passwords via a one-way hashing algorithm (Bcrypt). Memory uses Amazon S3 to store files like profile pictures, invoices and generated reports, and file paths are randomly generated SHA1 keys.
Do you run daily data backups?
Yes. Memory backs up data every day, and each backup is kept for a period of one week before being destroyed.
Can I delete data that I don’t want on your server?
Absolutely. You can delete memories either individually from your private timeline or in bulk from your Settings page, where you can also download all of your stored data at any point.
Are you GDPR compliant?
Yes, we are fully compliant with GDPR.
While our service itself is not currently SOC 2 compliant, we are hosted on AWS, which is SOC 2 compliant, ensuring that the foundational cloud infrastructure supporting our services meets rigorous security and reliability standards
What security do you you have in place to protect my data?
We are constantly working to fortify and update our systems based on the best security practices available. We use the latest and most up-to-date software packages and libraries to prevent any security vulnerabilities and possible attacks. All user inputs and data collection is filtered through multiple possible security attacks rules before it is received on the server for processing. We follow industry standard coding practices and review processes while developing our applications. We also follow a periodic password rotation policy for all our internal and external tokens and keys.
‍
All of our privacy program policies and procedures—including staff security training, escalation and reporting processes, and security incident response plans—are maintained and regularly reviewed by our Data Protection Officer (
dpo@timelyapp.com
). In the event of a system incident or breach, we have a dedicated Emergency Response Team ready, which consists of members of our QA, Support, Backend, and Operations teams.
