1. name and address information (and company name if you opt for this);
2. e-mail address;
3. financial information, such as your bank account number;
4. other Personal Data which you yourself mention in the text card;
5. telephone number;
6. other Personal Data which you yourself post on your ‘Unique Star Page’, which may include text, photographs and videos.
The basis for such Processing is performance of the agreement which you have concluded with us.
3.2. Contact
Second, we process your Personal Data if you try to contact us through our contact form on the Website or through
help@osr.org
. This enables us to respond to the questions you have. We process the following Personal Data from you for this purpose:
1. name;
2. e-mail address;
3. other Personal Data which you yourself mention in your message to us.
The basis for such Processing is a legitimate interest on our part, specifically, responding to the questions which you yourself ask us. Thus, we process the Personal Data concerned only to contact you in order to respond to your questions.
3.3. Newsletter
Third, we process your Personal Data to deliver our newsletter to you if you have registered for this (separately or during the order process). We process the following Personal Data from you for this purpose:
1. name;
2. e-mail address.
The basis for such Processing is a legitimate interest on our part, specifically, keeping you informed of news, discount codes / offers and new products and services.
3.4. Information about business gifts
Fourth, we process your Personal Data to inform you (at your request) about business gifts. We process the following Personal Data from you for this purpose:
1. name;
2. e-mail address;
3. company name;
4. other Personal Data which you yourself mention in your request to us.
The basis for such Processing is a legitimate interest on our part, specifically, informing you about the possibilities concerning business gifts.
4. Retention period
We do not retain your Personal Data for any longer than necessary for the aforementioned purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to do so. We apply the following specific retention periods:
1. For the purpose ‘Performance of agreement’, we retain your name and address information, financial information and telephone number for a 20-year period after you placed your last order. For this purpose, there is no specific retention period for your e-mail address or other Personal Data which you yourself mention in the text card or post on your Unique Star Page.
2. For the purpose ‘Contact’, we retain your Personal Data for a 5-year period after our last contact with you.
3. For the purpose ‘Newsletter’, we retain your Personal Data for a 1-year period after you have registered for the newsletter.

5. Cookies
We use cookies on the Website. We do this in accordance with the GDPR. In particular, we must inform you about certain cookies and also ask permission to use them. We satisfy these requirements through a ‘cookie bot’.
6. Sharing your Personal Data with third parties
In several cases, we need to share the Personal Data which we process from you with third parties. This pertains to the following situations:
1. in providing our services and delivering our products, for instance, if you opt for the recipient (a third party) to know from whom the gift came or if you use your own Unique Star Page (which may be made public on the Website);
2. to fulfil the legal obligations which we have, such as notification to the Dutch Data Protection Authority [
Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens
] (a third party);
3. in engaging external suppliers (third parties), for example, our ICT supplier and hosting party.
If we use external suppliers and these parties process Personal Data for us, then we will conclude a GDPR-compliant data processing agreement with these parties. If these parties do not process Personal Data for us, then they themselves will be responsible for Processing this Data and will therefore be bound by the GDPR.
7. Security of your Personal Data
We have taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to combat the misuse, loss, and unwanted disclosure of your Personal Data and unauthorised access and impermissible changes to this Data.
If you have questions about our securing your Personal Data or if you suspect misuse of your Personal Data, you can contact us through
help@osr.org
.

Right to erasure of Data
At your request, we will, without unreasonable delay, erase the Personal Data relating to you in the following cases:
1. the Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it has been collected or otherwise processed;

Right to data portability
You are entitled to receive, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, Personal Data which we are processing from you pursuant to the bases ‘performance of agreement’ and ‘legitimate interest’. In addition, you are entitled to transfer this Data to another Controller (besides us), with you having the right to have the Personal Data concerned be transferred, if technically possible, directly from us to the other Controller.
Right to object

You must understand, however, that objecting to the Processing referred to in this document or requesting erasure of Personal Data may result in our no longer being able to fulfil obligations towards you.
9. Fly me to the Stars App
What data do we collect?
An IP address is required to establish a connection between the user’s device and the solution’s server(s). It is necessary to temporarily store the user’s IP address. The IP addresses available from the server logs are only used to provide the services and to resolve any incidents.
We collect your data for the following purposes:
To gain more insight into whether the game is used by the target group and what the results are within the target group.
Anonymized analytical usage data; information about your use of the app
Firebase Analytics
For Fly me to the Stars we use Google’s Firebase Analytics. The information we get from this shows insight into how the app is used. With this information, the app can be improved by adding information, adding functionalities or increasing the ease of use. OSR has taken measures, including anonymizing the IP address of the data, to limit the traceability of users as much as possible.
10. Complaints
You may file a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority at any time.
