EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY/NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY
Echo360 is an equal opportunity employer and will provide equality in employment for all people employed or seeking employment. Every person will be given a fair and equitable chance to compete for appointment, promotion or transfer, and to pursue their career as effectively as others. Employment decisions relating to appointment, promotion and career development will be determined according to individual merit and competence.
We provide equal employment opportunity to all individuals, without consideration of any status or category protected by applicable law. Protected categories include, for example, race, color, hair texture or style, religion, national origin or ancestry, citizenship, ethnicity, disability, pregnancy (including childbirth and conditions related to pregnancy), sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, military/veteran status, or genetic information (collectively, these are called “Protected Categories” or referred to as a “Protected Category”).
The company prohibits discrimination and harassment against any member of a Protected Category. The company also prohibits retaliation for raising good-faith concerns related to the company’s commitment to an equal employment opportunity workplace. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruitment, hiring, classification, compensation, promotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.
If you learn of, observe, or have reason to be concerned about conduct in violation of this policy, please follow the procedures in the Reporting Procedures Policy below.
DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND RETALIATION PREVENTION
Echo360 is committed to providing a workplace that is free of verbal, physical and visual forms of harassment so that everyone can work in a productive, respectful and professional environment. We prohibit all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, as defined below. The company expects all relationships between employees will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice, and harassment. These expectations apply in the workplace and in any work-related settings. This policy applies to in-person conduct, email, text message, social media, and other communications. Please know that conduct may violate this policy and our expectations regarding workplace behavior even if it is not considered unlawful.
Discrimination.
Discrimination means treating employes differently in the terms or conditions of employment or denying a benefit because of or based on a Protected Category.
Sexual Harassment.
Sexual harassment is a type of harassment that is illegal. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: submitting to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment; submitting to or rejecting the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision; or the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with your work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, even if the person making the report is not the intended target of the conduct. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade job benefits for sexual favors. This can include hiring, promotion, continued employment or any other terms, or conditions or privileges of employment. This is also called “quid pro quo” harassment.
Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors. Sexual harassment includes harassment based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and the status of being transgender or gender non-conforming. It can occur between males and females, persons of the same sex, and involve individuals who are transgender or gender non-conforming. An act may be sexual harassment regardless of the sexual desire, sexual orientation, or intent of the harasser.
Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendos; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual’s body, sexual capability or sexual deficiencies; staring, whistling or touching; obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, including texting (a/k/a sexting) other such sexually suggestive objects or pictures via the company or personal cell phone or computer; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature.
Harassment.
This policy also applies to and prohibits harassment which is unwelcome verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct that degrades or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of their Protected Category and creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance. Examples of this type of prohibited harassment include, for example: use of racial or religious epithets, slurs, or physical gestures; mocking, ridiculing, or mimicking someone’s culture, accent, appearance, or customs; and/or making jokes, pranks, or behaving in a threatening, intimidating, or hostile way because of someone’s protected status.
Retaliation.
Retaliation is any type of action that adversely affects the terms of employment or the working environment because the individual made a complaint pursuant to the company’s policies against discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; encouraged someone to make a report or complaint; participated in the company investigation or legal/administrative proceeding under this policy; or opposed practices or conduct prohibited by the company’s policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment.
Protected Categories:
Protected categories include, for example, race; color; religion; creed; national origin; ancestry; citizenship; age; sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions and transgender status); gender (including gender identity and gender expression); sexual orientation; familial/marital status; reproductive health decision-making; genetic information (including predisposing genetic characteristics); disability; medical condition; military/veteran status; prior arrest/conviction record; or status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or any characteristic protected by federal law or the state or local laws in your work location (“Protected Categories”).
REPORTING EEO, DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND RETALIATION CONCERNS
If you see, witness, or experience a violation of the company’s expectations surrounding EEO, non-discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation promptly follow the reporting procedures below:
If possible, document in writing the date, time, place, witnesses, what was said or done, and the surrounding circumstances.
If you are comfortable doing so, communicate your objections to the conduct and promptly tell the person engaging in the conduct it is unwelcome and offensive. In many cases, if an employee makes their feelings known to the offending persons, tells them the conduct is not appropriate, and asks them to stop, this may take care of the situation.
Promptly report any offending behavior, whether such behavior is directed towards them personally or to other employees at Echo360 to any member of the Human Resources staff. You may also escalate concerns to the CEO.
You may provide your name or remain anonymous. If you wish to remain anonymous, we partner with EthicsPoint, and you may submit an anonymous message through contacting 855-233-3139. Anonymous complaints, however, are often more difficult to investigate. With that in mind, we strongly recommend that anyone who makes an anonymous complaint provide as much specific information as possible.
If you are a member of company management and you learn about conduct that is or may be in violation of this policy, whether informally, through a formal complaint, or otherwise, you must immediately report it to Human Resources.
If you see, witness, or experience a violation of another company policy, we encourage you to share your concerns by reporting right away – even if you are not certain a violation occurred. When you report concerns, you help us handle issues properly, fix problems before they occur and remedy situations that have already happened. You also help build trust with each other and with our customers, our suppliers and other business partners. To report concerns, please reach out in the following order: your manager; another manager at Echo360; Human Resources; the CEO.
When reporting a concern, we will do all we can to protect your identity consistent with conducting a thorough investigation. We take every report seriously and will investigate it thoroughly and as confidentially as possible. We expect everyone involved to cooperate fully and honestly.
The company encourages prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so it can take rapid and constructive action. Early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. We ask that you report your violations of this policy as described above, because we believe that it is the most efficient way to address issues that may arise. We recognize that employees may have other means to resolve workplace issues, and this policy is not intended to prevent employees from utilizing other avenues that may be available to them under state or federal law.
The company will promptly and thoroughly investigate all claims of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. Complaints will be handled with sensitivity, discretion and confidentiality to the extent allowed by the circumstances and the law. Generally, this means that allegations are shared with those who have a need to know so that the company can conduct an effective investigation.
The complaining employee is usually requested to provide as many details as possible, such as the dates(s), location(s), names(s) of witnesses, or information about the alleged harasser(s). Persons with relevant information are interviewed as needed. During the investigation, steps may be taken, when appropriate, to minimize contact between the involved employees, like schedule changes, temporary transfers or investigatory leave. The company will evaluate the information gathered; reach reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected; and take appropriate remedial, corrective, and/or disciplinary action as necessary. Such action may include, by way of example only, discipline, reassignments, changes in reporting relationships, training, suspension, or termination of employment.
No action will be taken against any employee who in good faith files a complaint of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation or assists in the investigation of such a complaint. Employees who believe they have been retaliated against for having reported harassment or participated in an investigation must promptly notify any member of the Human Resources staff so such concerns can be investigated.
GENDER EQUALITY POLICY
Within the principle of providing equal employment opportunities for all qualified employees and applicants, the Company is committed to promoting a workplace culture that is inclusive, supportive, and respectful of all employees, regardless of gender. Our commitment to gender equality is manifest in the following areas:
1. Non-discrimination
We do not tolerate discrimination based on gender, gender identity, gender expression, or any other protected characteristic. We expect all employees to treat each other with respect and dignity, and to avoid any behavior or language that could be considered discriminatory.
2. Equal Opportunity
We provide equal employment opportunities to all employees, including opportunities for promotion, training, and development. We do not discriminate based on gender, and we are committed to creating a workplace where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.
3. Pay Equity
We are committed to paying all employees fairly and equitably, regardless of gender. We regularly review our pay practices to identify and address any disparities, and we strive to provide competitive compensation packages to all employees.
4. Harassment and Bullying
We do not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying, including sexual harassment, in the workplace. We take all complaints of harassment or bullying seriously and investigate them thoroughly. We provide support and resources to employees who experience harassment or bullying, and we take appropriate disciplinary action against anyone found to have engaged in such behavior.
5. Flexible Work Arrangements
We offer flexible work arrangements to help employees balance their work and personal responsibilities. We understand that everyone’s needs are different, and we strive to accommodate individual preferences as much as possible.
6. Support for Caregivers
We recognize the challenges that caregivers face and are committed to supporting employees who have caregiving responsibilities. We offer a range of support services, such as flexible work arrangements, access to child care or elder care resources, and time off for caregiving responsibilities.
TRANSGENDER POLICY
Echo360 does not discriminate on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This policy is designed to create a safe and productive workplace environment for all employees.
This policy sets forth guidelines to address the needs of transgender and gender non-conforming employees and clarifies how the law should be implemented in situations where questions may arise about how to protect the legal rights or safety of such employees. This policy does not anticipate every situation that might occur with respect to transgender or gender non-conforming employees, and the needs of each transgender or gender non-conforming employee must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Echo360 strives to secure a safe and non-discriminatory work environment for all employees.
The definitions provided here are not intended to label employees but rather to assist in understanding this policy and the legal obligations of employers. Employees may or may not use these terms to describe themselves.
•
Gender identity:
A person’s internal, deeply-felt sense of being male, female, or something else, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth. Everyone has a gender identity.
•
Gender expression:
An individual’s characteristics and behaviors (such as appearance, dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions) that may be perceived as associated with a gender.
•
Transgender:
An umbrella term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from their sex assigned at birth.
A person whose sex assigned at birth was female but who identifies as male is a transgender man (also known as female-to male transgender person, or FTM).
A person whose sex assigned at birth was male but who identifies as female is a transgender woman (also known as male-to-female transgender person, or MTF).
Some people described by this definition don’t consider themselves transgender – they may use other words, or may identify simply as a man or woman. A person does not need to identify as transgender in order for an employer’s nondiscrimination policies to apply to them.
Gender non-conforming:
This term describes people who have, or are perceived to have, gender characteristics and/or behaviors that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations. Keep in mind that these expectations can vary across cultures and have changed over time.
Transition:
The process of changing one’s gender from the sex assigned at birth to one’s gender identity. There are many different ways to transition. For some people, it is a complex process that takes place over a long period of time, while for others it is a one- or two-step process that happens more quickly. Transition may include “coming out” (telling family, friends, and coworkers); changing the name and/or sex on legal documents; and, for many transgender people, accessing medical treatment such as hormones and surgery.
Sexual orientation:
A person’s physical or emotional attraction to people of the same and/or other gender. Straight, gay, and bisexual are some ways to describe sexual orientation. It is important to note that sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and expression. Transgender people can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight, just like non-transgender people.
LGBT
: A common abbreviation that refers to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.
Privacy:
Transgender employees have the right to discuss their gender identity or expression openly, or to keep that information private. A transgender employee may decide when, with whom, and how much to share their private information, and Echo360 will strive to handle communications with regard to changes to an employee’s gender identity or expression with sensitivity and input from the employee.
Official Records:
Echo360 will change an employee’s official record to reflect a change in preferred name or gender identity upon request from the employee. Certain types of records, like those relating to payroll and retirement accounts, may require a legal name change before the person’s name can be changed. Most records, however, can be changed to reflect a person’s preferred name without proof of a legal name change. If a new or transitioning employee has questions about company records or ID documents, the employee should contact Human Resources.
Names/Pronouns:
An employee has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to the employee’s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required. The intentional or persistent refusal to respect an employee’s gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the employee by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the employee’s gender identity or preferred name) can constitute harassment and is a violation of this policy. If you are unsure what pronoun a transitioning coworker might prefer, you can politely ask your coworker how they would like to be addressed.
ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY
The Company is committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Corruption in any form is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. We have a responsibility to act with honesty and transparency in all of our business dealings.
The Company’s Anti-Corruption Policy includes but is not limited to:
• Bribery, including offering or accepting gifts, money, or other benefits in exchange for business or personal favors.
• Kickbacks, including giving or receiving money or other benefits in exchange for business referrals or contracts.
• Fraud, including misrepresenting company information or falsifying records.
• Any other corrupt or unethical behavior that violates the law or company policies.
All employees are required to comply with this policy and any applicable laws and regulations. Employees who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The company reserves the right to take legal action against any employee or third party involved in corruption or unethical behavior.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION POLICY
The Company recognizes and respects our employees’ right to express their opinions and views freely, both inside and outside of the workplace. We believe that open communication and the exchange of ideas are essential to creating a productive, creative, and supportive workplace culture, and we foster employee freedom of expression through the following:
Open Communication
We encourage open communication and the exchange of ideas among all employees, and we strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable expressing their opinions and views. We believe that diverse perspectives lead to better decision-making and problem-solving, and we value the contributions of all employees.
Respectful Communication
While we encourage open communication, we also expect all employees to communicate in a respectful and professional manner. We do not tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination, or bullying in the workplace, including any communication that could be considered threatening or offensive.
Confidentiality
We recognize that certain information must be kept confidential, such as trade secrets, proprietary information, and personal information. We expect all employees to respect the confidentiality of such information and to avoid disclosing it to unauthorized parties.
Social Media
We recognize that social media has become an important tool for communication and expression, both inside and outside of the workplace. We expect all employees to use social media in a responsible and professional manner, and to avoid any communication that could be considered defamatory, harassing, discriminatory, or offensive.
ECHO360 MODERN SLAVERY POLICY
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights; it includes slavery, servitude, forced labour, forced marriage, child labour violations, debt bondage, deceptive recruiting for labour or services, and human trafficking.
Echo360 is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships, and to implementing and enforcing systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not present or permitted in our own business practices or across any of our controllable supply chains.

This policy applies to all persons working for Echo360 or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees, directors, officers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, consultants, third-party representatives, and business partners. The policy is applied to and enforced for all Echo360 business activities in all Echo360 markets.
Responsibility for the policy
Echo360 has responsibility for ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical obligations, and that those under our direct or indirect management comply with it.
Compliance with the policy
All persons working for Echo360 must comply with this policy. The prevention, detection, and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chains is the responsibility of those working for us or under our control.
All persons are required to avoid any activity that might lead to or suggest a breach of this policy and must notify their line manager OR a company Director as soon as soon as they believe or suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred or may occur in the future.
If any person working for Echo360 is unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their working conditions within any tier of Echo360’s supply chains constitute any of the various forms of modern slavery, they must raise it with Human Resources via email to
HR@echo360.com

REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR DISABILITIES
The company is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities. The goal of reasonable accommodations is to enable people with disabilities to overcome work-related barriers and to fostering an inclusive workplace. An individual may be considered disabled if they have an impairment that substantially limits one or more of their major life activities, a record or history of such an impairment, or is perceived as having such an impairment. The definition of disability also may include pregnant employees impacted by medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.
If you believe you need an accommodation because of your disability, you are responsible for requesting a reasonable accommodation from the Human Resources Department. You may make the request orally or in writing. The company encourages employees to make their request in writing on a company form, available from Human Resources, and to include relevant information, such as:
• A description of the accommodation you are requesting.
• The reason you need an accommodation.
• How the accommodation will help you perform the essential functions of your job.
After receiving your oral or written request, the company will engage in an interactive dialogue with you to determine the precise limitations of your disability and explore potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. The company encourages you to suggest specific reasonable accommodations that you believe would allow you to perform your job. Please understand, however, that the company is not required to make the specific accommodation requested by you and may provide an alternative effective accommodation, to the extent any reasonable accommodation can be made without imposing an undue hardship on the company.
The company makes determinations about reasonable accommodations on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors and based on an individualized assessment in each situation and strives to make determinations as expeditiously as possible. During the interactive process, Human Resources will partner with you, management, and healthcare provider(s) to assess if a reasonable accommodation is possible. Communication with healthcare professionals may be necessary to verify the existence of a disability or work restrictions, to identify potential reasonable accommodations, and/or to assess if an accommodation would cause undue hardship. Employees are required to cooperate with this process by providing all necessary documentation supporting the need for accommodation and to consider alternative accommodations when applicable. The company will treat medical information as confidential.
The company strictly prohibits discrimination and retaliation against qualified individuals with disabilities who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of their job and prohibits retaliation for requesting an accommodation. If you believe you were retaliated against, please follow the reporting procedures in the Reporting EEO, Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Concerns policy.
RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS
The company recognizes and respects the diversity of religious beliefs, practices, and observances. When work obligations conflict with religious beliefs, the company is committed to exploring whether the company may provide an accommodation that will eliminate the conflict, while preserving your ability to fully perform the essential functions of your job.
If you need a religious accommodation, discuss your request with Human Resources. The company will not retaliate against you for requesting an accommodation under this policy. If you believe you were retaliated against promptly notify Human Resources.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY STATEMENT
Echo360 is committed to reducing its impact on the environment. We will strive to improve our environmental performance over time and to initiate additional projects and activities that will further reduce our impacts on the environment.
Our commitment to the environment extends to our customers, our staff, our partners, and the community in which we operate. We are committed to:
• Comply with all applicable environmental regulations;
• Prevent pollution whenever possible;
• Train all staff on our environmental program and empower them to contribute and participate;
• Communicate our environmental commitment and efforts to our customers, staff, and our community; and
• Continually improve over time by striving to measure our environmental impacts and by setting goals to reduce these impacts each year.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IMPACT A: Solution Sustainability
Echo360’s solution is hosted by Amazon Web Services and Echo360 trusts AWS to minimise its impact on the environment as much as possible. AWS has publicly shared its commitment to sustainable energy with a goal to power the global AWS infrastructure with 100% renewable energy by 2025.
AWS is rapidly progressing towards meeting these goals by focusing on four complementary areas.
• First, AWS is continuously working on ways to increase the energy efficiency of its facilities and equipment, innovating the design and manufacture of its servers, storage, and networking equipment to reduce energy use and improve operational excellence as the business grows.
• Second, AWS works with industry associations, international, federal, and state governments to increase incentives and create a more favourable environment for renewable energy.
• Third, AWS works with its various power providers that supply AWS data centres around the world to increase the availability of renewables in their power supply while maintaining low prices.
• And fourth, AWS has funded many wind and solar PPAs to increase the overall amount of renewable energy available on the grids that serve AWS data centres.
These initiatives will be extended to the global AWS data centres over time.
Amazon is part of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE –
http://www.acore.org/
) and participates in the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance (US PREF –
http://uspref.org/
) to increase its work with state and federal policymakers and other stakeholders to enable more renewable energy opportunities for cloud providers.
Please visit
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/
for more details about AWS’s approach to sustainability.

Energy Use
•

Customers may use this information for their sales and marketing activities. We rely on our legitimate interests, as well as those of our customers, to collect and share data for the purposes listed.

. HOW WE TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA INTERNATIONALLY
4.1 International Transfers within the HubSpot Group. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer information that may include Personal Data to other HubSpot Affiliates who act as subprocessors, where we have operations for the purposes described in this policy. Please see
Annex 3 of our Customer Data Processing Agreement
for a list of impacted HubSpot Affiliates and their locations.
This Privacy Policy will apply even if we transfer Personal Data to other countries. We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected wherever it is transferred. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Switzerland or the United Kingdom ("UK") within and among HubSpot’s Affiliates, we rely upon the the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the European Commission and Swiss authorities) and UK Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the UK authorities) where required.  We also have additional safeguards where appropriate (such as commercial industry standard secure encryption methods to protect customer data at rest and in transit, TLS for HubSpot hosted sites, web application firewall protection, and other appropriate contractual and organizational measures), as described more in detail in the
HubSpot Trust Center
.
4.2 International Transfers to Third Parties. Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA, Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate. For transfers to or from the United Kingdom, we make use of the UK Addendum. For transfers to or from Canada, we make use of the standard contractual clauses. With respect to personal data received from or transferred to Canada, HubSpot is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Please contact us if you need more information about the legal mechanisms we rely on to transfer personal data outside the EEA, Switzerland, Canada, and UK.
4.3 Data Privacy Framework Notice. HubSpot complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively “the Data Privacy Framework”).
HubSpot has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union, and the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) and to the Swiss-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
