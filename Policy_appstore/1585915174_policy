INFORMATION
FOR PARENTS
Before
your child can use the Game, you will need to provide your consent to approve
your child’s account set-up and the processing of their personal information.
What
personal information does the Game process?
The
Game is a PC, mobile and webpage game.
If
your child successfully signs up to the Game, this will result in the
collection and sharing of certain personal information:
·
Age
and IP address.
·
Log-in
information: Open ID, and other information if relevant, such as email address.
·
Customary
device and network information: such as IP address, connection speed, device
specifications, as well as app- and OS-generated identifiers.
·
Customer
support information: such as details of ticket, complaint and handling, email
address, name, open ID, device and network information.
·
Game
data, crash and analytics information.
You
can review our Privacy Policy for more details on what personal
information we collect and how we use and process the information.
Does the
Game process personal information differently for children?
Children
will not be able to access the free chat function and can only communicate
using the quick chat function by selecting pre-set text messages.
Why
is my consent required?
Certain
jurisdictions require or recommend the consent of a parent or legal guardian
before their child can sign up to a game such as the Game, where personal
information will be processed. If you do not consent, or withdraw your consent,
we will immediately delete any personal information collected up to that point.
What
method(s) can I use to verify my child’s account?
In
some jurisdictions, including the United States, we ask for date of birth at
registration. We will not allow a child to sign-up without first obtaining
verifiable consent from that child’s parent or legal guardian. As part of this,
we need to verify that you are an adult capable of providing such consent. To
do this, we charge or authorize a small amount to a credit card. This process
is handled by Ayden. We do not process your credit card information – only the
third party payment processor collects credit card information. The credit card
information is not retained for any reason, including future purchases or
connected to in-app payment functions (if any) in the game.
What
if there are changes to the Game
in the future?
If
we make any changes to the way their personal information is processed, we will
notify you of those changes. You must consent to those changes before your
child’s personal information will be processed for that new purpose.
Will
you retain my personal information?
We
will keep a record of your email address so that we can notify you of any
changes to the processing of your child’s personal information, and so that we
know you are a parent or legal guardian of a player when you contact us. As
mentioned above, your credit card information is not processed by us, but
instead only processed by a third party payment processor. We do not have
access to your credit card information.
What
if I do not consent?
If
you do not consent (including by providing your credit card details
for verification) then your contact information will be deleted.
How
do I withdraw my consent or delete my child’s account?
You
can withdraw your consent or delete your child’s account by emailing us
at
dpo@nikke-global.com
.
You can also request a copy of your child’s personal information at any time.

Please refer to the Supplemental Jurisdiction-Specific Terms, or the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, for an overview of specific rights that apply to persons subject to data protection laws in the listed jurisdictions and how these can be exercised.

INFORMATION FOR PARENTS
Before your child can use the Service, you will need to provide your consent to approve your child’s account set-up and the processing of their personal information.
What personal information does the Service process?
The Service is an online account system that allows signup and login to various LIP-Enabled Services.
If your child successfully signs up to the Service, this will result in the collection and sharing of certain personal information.
For the purpose of providing your child with their LEVEL INFINITE PASS Account, we may collect your child’s:
LIP Account registration information (including email address, user ID, nickname, user token, Open ID, date of birth, country/region), which is used to register each user account;
social media account information (social media account user ID, nickname, profile picture, user token, Open ID), if these are used to create an LIP Account;
phone number and email (if these are added and linked to the account), to enable login and for security purposes;
friends list, to enable them to connect with friends when using the Service;
customer support information, if they contact customer support;
transaction information, if they choose to make purchases;
information for community services, to enable participation in community services;
survey responses, if they choose to participate in LIP-Enabled Service feedback surveys from time to time;
sweepstakes, tournament, e-sports, beta test information and Rewards feature information, if they choose to participate in a sweepstake or beta testing; register for a tournament or e-sports event; or use the Rewards feature to complete designated tasks;
location information (province and city) if this is provided on a voluntary basis, to enable region-specific features;
data subject request information, if a data subject request is submitted; and
LIP-Enabled Service information that is generated when they use an LIP-Enabled Service using their LIP Account login (e.g. gaming activity log, gameplay reports, performance, statistics, device information, IP address, text chat and voice chat (to the extent this is available in your jurisdiction), user comments, transaction records (if a payment is made), security-related information, advertising ID and marketing analytics data).
The personal information processed by LIP-Enabled Services with LIP Account login includes:
LIP Account data;
service information (e.g. service activity log, service reports, performance, statistics);
device information;
IP address;
text chat and voice chat (to the extent this is available in your jurisdiction);
customer support information;
user comments;
information relating to community services used;
transaction records (if a payment is made);
security-related information; and
advertising ID and marketing analytics data.
You can review our Privacy Policy for more details on what personal information we collect and how we use and process the information.
Does the Service
process personal information differently for children?
Yes. In some jurisdictions, children will not be able access certain features, such as free chat function, and will only be able to access quick chat function.
Why is my consent required?
Certain jurisdictions require or recommend the consent of a parent or legal guardian before their child can use our Service and sign up to LIP-Enabled Services, where personal information will be processed. If you do not consent, or withdraw your consent, we will immediately delete any personal information collected up to that point.
What method(s) can I use to verify my child’s account?
In some jurisdictions, including the United States, we ask for date of birth at registration. We will not allow a child to sign-up without first obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or legal guardian. As part of this, we need to verify that you are an adult capable of providing such consent. To do this, we charge or authorize a small amount to a credit card. This process is handled by Skyblue Enjoy Investment Pte. Ltd. We do not process your credit card information – only the third party payment processor collects credit card information. The credit card information is not retained for any reason, including future purchases or connected to in-app payment functions (if any) in the LIP-Enabled Service.
What if there are changes to the Service
in the future?
If we make any changes to the way their personal information is processed, we will notify you of those changes. You must consent to those changes before your child’s personal information will be processed for that new purpose.
Will you retain my personal information?
We will keep a record of your email address so that we can notify you of any changes to the processing of your child’s personal information, and so that we know you are a parent or legal guardian of a user when you contact us. We will send you an e-mail to notify you when your child uses their LIP Account to log in to a new LIP-Enabled Service.  As mentioned above, your credit card information is not processed by us (to the extent this method is available to you), but instead only processed by a third party payment processor. We do not have access to your credit card information.
What if I do not consent?
If you do not consent (including by providing your credit card details for verification) then your contact information will be deleted.
How do I withdraw my consent or delete my child’s account?
You can withdraw your consent or delete your child’s account by emailing us at
dpo@levelinfinite.com
. You can also request a copy of your child’s personal information at any time.

How We Share Personal Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Us and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.
At Your Option:
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Location of Personal Information
Amazon Web Services, Inc. is located in the United States, and our affiliated companies are located throughout the world. Depending on the scope of your interactions with AWS Offerings, your personal information may be stored in or accessed from multiple countries, including the United States. Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.

We maintain a wide variety of compliance programs that validate our security controls. Click
