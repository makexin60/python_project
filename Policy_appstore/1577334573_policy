Other service providers engaged in connection with specific Services as referenced in the Sections above.
Governmental authorities, courts and similar third parties that are public bodies
– We may disclose your personal data to governmental authorities, courts and similar third parties that are public bodies where we have a legal obligation to do so (Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR) or for the purpose of protecting our interests or enforcing our rights (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). These recipients will process the relevant personal data as independent controllers.
Outside professional advisors
– We may disclose your personal data to our tax consultants, auditors, accountants, legal advisors and other outside professional advisors for the purpose of operating our business (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). In some cases, we may also disclose the data for the purpose of protecting our interests or enforcing our rights (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). These recipients will usually process the relevant personal data as independent controllers.
Third-party acquirers
– In the event that we sell or transfer all or any relevant portion of our assets or business (including reorganisation or liquidation), we may disclose your personal data to third-party acquirers (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). These recipients will process the relevant personal data as independent controllers.
Others
– We may also disclose your personal data to other third parties (insurance companies, leasing companies, financial service providers, fleet companies, data aggregators); however, we will only share your personal data with such third parties where: (i) you have given your prior consent for such disclosure (Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR); (ii) such disclosure is necessary for the performance of our contract or the relevant third party’s contract with you (Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR); or (iii) the sharing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interest pursued by the relevant third party to the extent that such legitimate interest is not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). These recipients will process the relevant personal data as independent controllers.
On or around the production date of a vehicle and before the vehicle is placed on the market and sold for the first time, we share certain information about the Advanced Driver Assist System (“
ADAS
”) (namely, the vehicle build information (VBI), which includes the vehicle identification number (VIN), model, trim, model year, price, colour, fuel type, voltage system, emissions, class, power and fitted equipment including ADAS safety systems) applicable to that vehicle with pre-selected data aggregators. At the time of sharing, the relevant data does not relate to an individual and therefore does not constitute personal data. The data is shared by us and then processed by the data aggregators for the purpose of protecting against possible fraudulent practices and simplifying the insurance process for Kia vehicle drivers or owners. In addition, please note that we also process such data for our own purposes of analysing, improving and developing our products. Where we process such data for our own purposes after the vehicle has been placed on the market and been sold for the first time, we anonymise the relevant data before carrying out any such processing activities to ensure that you are not identifiable from the relevant data.
16.
Cross-Border Data Transfer
We are a member of an international group of companies. Therefore, we may transfer personal data within the Kia group and to other third parties as noted in Section
15
.
Some of these recipients may be located or have relevant operations outside of your country and the EU/EEA (e.g. in the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom or the USA) (“
Third Country
”).
For some Third Countries, the European Commission has determined that they provide an adequate level of protection for personal data (e.g., the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom), which also includes the USA to the extent that the receiving company in the USA participates in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (see https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov) (“
Adequate Jurisdictions
”).
Where we transfer personal data to a recipient that is located in a Third Country which has not been determined an Adequate Jurisdiction, we (or our processors in the EU/EEA that transfer personal data to sub-processors in such Third Countries, as applicable) provide appropriate safeguards by way of entering into data transfer agreements adopted by the European Commission (standard contractual clauses) with the recipients or taking other effective measures to provide an adequate level of data protection.
A copy of the respective safeguards may be requested from us or our DPO (see Section
2
and Section
3

The retention period may be extended in accordance with national laws when processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and we or third parties have a corresponding legitimate interest (e.g. for the period of impending legal (administrative and/or judicial) procedures and for the duration of such legal proceedings, including the expiration periods of any recourse).
