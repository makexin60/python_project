Mention Me Limited is a company registered in England and Wales.
Our registered company number is: 08382730
Our registered office is at: 20-22 Wenlock Road, London, N1 7GU
Our trading office is at: Vox Studios, 1-45 Durham St, London, SE11 5JH
Our Data Protection Register number is: ZA004639
Mention Me helps online businesses (our
Clients
) operate refer-a-friend
                                programmes and related services. We act as a service provider and data processor
                                to our Clients.
Through our technology platform, our Clients can: (a) enable their customers to refer their friends to their brand and then reward both the referrer and the referred friend when the referred friend becomes a customer; (b) deliver rewards and offers to customers; and (c) engage with their customers.
The following key terms are used in this Policy:
Client
A Client is an online business for whom Mention Me operates a refer-a-friend programme and related services. We provide services to our Clients and process data in connection with those services on their behalf as their Data Processor. If you are a Referrer or a Referee under a refer-a-friend programme, a reference to a Client will mean the brand or online business whose refer-a-friend programme you are participating in.
Data Controller
A Data Controller is the person who determines the purposes for which and the
                                        manner in which personal data is processed
Data Processor
A Data Processor is a person who processes personal data on behalf of a
                                        Data Controller
Mention Me takes data privacy very seriously. We hold various personal data relating to
                            individuals who have interacted with our website or our services. What data we hold about
                            you and why we hold it will depend on how you interacted with us. You can find all the
                            relevant detail behind the tab which applies to you below:
Customers of a Client (including Referrers)
Referees
Site Visitors
If you are an existing customer of the Client (including a Referrer or a potential Referrer under one of our Client's refer-a-friend programmes):
We may hold the following personal data about you:
Your email address;
Your name (which we may use to infer your gender);
The order details and order history of purchases of goods/services you have made with the Client;
Details of your interactions with our clients and our referral programme;
Details about whether you have referred someone and how you referred them;
As is true of most websites, we also automatically gather information about your
                                    computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages and operating
                                    system. When you visit our hosted-pages, we also use cookies to identify you when
                                    you come back to the site. For more information on the cookies we use, why we use
                                    them and more information about cookies generally, please see our
Cookie Policy
If you are a customer of multiple Clients which use Mention Me’s services, then we will hold your data in respect of each Client separately. Your data is never shared between Clients.
The above data is either:
collected from you by our Client (the Data Controller) or one of our Client’s partners and shared with us in accordance with the Client or our Client’s partners’ privacy policy so that we can operate the service for the Client or our Client’s partners; or
We may also receive your email address and name directly
                                            from you if you have entered it into our Referrer registration page.
We need the above data:
To allow us to recognise you and reward you as the Referrer when your friends interact with a sharing link you have sent them and/or give us your name through our ‘name sharing’ feature.
To send you service emails solely in connection with the refer-a-friend programme or the fulfilment of any reward or offer – for example to help you share offers with your friends, to notify you when your friends engage with an offer and to email you rewards as and when you are eligible to receive them. You can opt-out of receiving these emails at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the footer of any email you receive from us or via our
data privacy contact form
.
To help confirm that friends referred through a refer-a-friend programme are
                                        not existing customers of the Client and are therefore eligible for
                                        referee rewards.
To allocate you into a customer segment (a set of customers
grouped by their characteristics) and display messages, rewards and offers to you based on your segment. This allocation may be done automatically via a segmentation tool.
To process your responses and rewards and offers.
To investigate activity that we suspect as being contrary to the Client's terms and conditions or fraudulent in nature.
To respond to customer service requests.
To undertake individual and/or aggregate statistical analysis as requested by the Client to better understand their business, profitability and growth.
To analyse responses and information in an anonymised and aggregated way in order to understand consumer behaviour and share such information with selected third party partners to help them understand consumer behaviour.
We hold and process all of the above data as a Data Processor on behalf of our
                                    Client, who is the Data Controller. This means that we keep your data strictly
                                    confidential and we only ever use your data in accordance with our
                                    Client’s instructions.
So that you are not prevented from participating in the programme or otherwise redeeming rewards and/or offers, we will normally hold your data for as long as the Client continues to work with us or such other period as they may specify in their instructions to us.
Some Clients will prescribe specific (shorter) retention periods for specific types of data we hold about their customers. If you would like details of any retention periods which may apply to you, please contact us via our
data privacy contact form
.
When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it.
In the ordinary course, we will only ever share your data with our Client or, on a confidential basis, with our own carefully selected sub-processors who are directly involved in delivering our services. Our sub-processors are only engaged with our Client’s consent and are primarily used for the purposes of hosting our platform and assisting with sending service emails to our Client's customers (including referrers) and referees. We only allow our sub-processors to handle your personal information if we are satisfied they take appropriate measures to protect your personal information. We also impose contractual obligations on sub-processors relating to ensure they can only use your personal information to provide services to us and to you. We may also share personal information with external auditors, accreditation and the audit of our accounts.
We never sell or give your personal information to third parties to use for
                                    their own purposes.
In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose or transfer your personal
                                    information:
as required by law.
when we (or our Client) believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
                                        protect our rights, protect your safety or the rights and safety of other third
                                        parties (including other Mention me users), investigate fraud, or respond to a
                                        government request.
to a third-party buyer or seller in the event that Mention Me is involved in a
                                        merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets.
to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
Information we hold about you is stored and processed principally in the Mention Me platform. The Mention Me platform is hosted in a secure data centre within the European Economic Area (
EEA
). Your information may be shared with our carefully selected sub-processors who are directly involved with the delivery of our services but such sub-processors shall only process personal information in the EEA and otherwise in countries which have an adequate level of protection from a data protection perspective. In particular, we process your data in France, Ireland and the UK.
In the event that the processing of your personal information at any time requires it to be transferred to and/or stored at or accessed from a destination outside the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely, in accordance with this policy and safeguarded in accordance with all applicable legislation.
We have appropriate security measures to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed unlawfully. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to access it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We continually test our systems and are ISO 27001 certified, which means we follow top industry standards for information security. We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal
                                    information. You can make this objection to us via our
data privacy contact form
,
                                    or to our Client (the Data Controller) in accordance with the procedure set out
                                    in their privacy notice which is available on their website. We will pass any
                                    processing objection we receive on to the relevant Client for their
                                    consideration.
You have the right to access any information we hold about you. Any request
                                        which is manifestly unfounded or excessive may be subject to a reasonable fee
                                        to cover our administrative costs in providing you with the necessary details.
You have the right to ensure the personal information we hold about you is up
                                        to date and accurate.
If you have given direct consent to us (or indirectly via the Client) to
                                        process any of your personal information you may withdraw that consent at any
                                        time.
You have the right to opt-out of receiving emails from us at any time. You can
                                        do this by managing your privacy settings in the link contained in the footer
                                        of any email you may receive from us. You can also opt-out via our
data privacy contact form
. Please note that if you
                                        opt-out of receiving Mention Me emails:
we will not be able to send you any rewards or offers you may be
                                                entitled to; and
you will not be automatically opted-out of any other communications
                                                you may have opted to receive from the relevant Client. You will need
                                                to inform the Client directly if you wish to opt-out of their direct
                                                communications.
You have the right to request that the personal information we hold about you
                                        be erased and/or request that the processing of that data be restricted.
If you would like to exercise any of the rights listed above, you may submit a request to us via our
data privacy contact form
or by post to 20-22 Wenlock Road, London, N1 7GU. You may also submit a request directly to the relevant Client in accordance with the procedures outlined in their privacy policy which will be available on their website.
We will share any request promptly with the relevant Client who is the Data
                                    Controller and ultimately responsible for decisions made in respect of personal
                                    information we hold about you.
If you have registered as a Referred Friend under a refer-a-friend programme:
We may hold the following personal data about you:
Your email address;
Details of your visits to any refer-a-friend programme you are
                                        participating in; and

As is true of most websites, we also automatically gather information about your

                                    system. When you visit our hosted-pages, we also use cookies to identify
                                    you when you come back to the site. For more information on the cookies we use,
                                    why we use them and more information about cookies generally, please see our
Cookie Policy
If you have registered as a Referred Friend under multiple refer-a-friend programmes
                                    provided by different Clients, then we will hold the above data in respect of
                                    each separate refer-a-friend programme you participate in. Your data is kept
                                    separate for each refer-a-friend programme and is never shared between Clients.
We receive your email address:
directly from you when you when enter it into our Referee registration page
                                        after you have clicked on a sharing link; or
From our Client if you have entered it into their website when using our
                                        ‘share by name’ feature.
We need the above data:

                                        the conditions necessary to receive a reward under the refer-a-friend programme
                                        you are participating in.
To send you service emails solely in connection with the refer-a-friend programme – for example to email you rewards as and when you are eligible to receive them. You can opt-out of receiving these emails at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the footer of any email you receive from us or via our
data privacy contact form
.
If, and only if, you have opted-in to receive marketing communications
                                        from the relevant Client, we will share your email address with the Client
                                        to enable them to send you those communications.
To respond to customer service requests.
We hold and process all of the above data as a Data Processor on behalf of our
                                    Client, who is the Data Controller. This means that we keep your data strictly
                                    confidential and we only ever use your data in accordance with our
                                    Client's instructions.
How long we hold your data for will depend on the particular Client and the
                                    instructions they have given us. We will normally always retain your data for at
                                    least as long as the validity period of the offer or reward that has been shared
                                    with you by your friend.
Some Clients will prescribe specific (shorter or longer) retention periods for your
                                    data. If you would like details of any retention periods which may apply to the
                                    specific refer-a-friend programme you are enrolled in, please contact us
                                    via our
data privacy contact form
.
When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it.
In the ordinary course, we will only ever share your data with:
our Client;
the friend who has referred you (so that we can notify them when they are due a
                                        reward for their referral); or
on a confidential basis, our own carefully selected sub-processors who are directly involved in delivering our refer-a-friend services.

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
Depending on the data protection laws applicable to you, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data that we process as a data controller:
that we provide details about the categories of personal data that we collect about you, including how we collect and share it;
that we provide you access to, and a copy of, the personal data we collect about you;
that we update or correct any inaccurate personal data we have about you;
that we delete the personal data we have about you;
that we restrict processing of personal data about you;
that we provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit that information to another controller, and where feasible, transmit the information directly;
that we provide you with the right to object to the processing of personal data, including profiling;
that we provide you with a free, easy mechanism to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes;
that you not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects or similarly affects your individual rights;
to withdraw your consent; and
to complain to a competent supervisory authority and/or to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Twilio will honor your rights subject to limitations in certain situations, such as where Twilio can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement or legitimate interest to process your data or can legitimately apply an exemption to the exercise of a right under applicable law. More information about these rights can be found in our Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy
Rule 10
and
Appendix 3
.
If you are a
US resident
interested in what personal data we have disclosed lately for our business purposes, here’s a list:
Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Privacy Notice or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.
If Twilio processes your personal data as a data processor on behalf of a customer, we will either direct you to contact our customer to exercise your rights.
How To Exercise Your Rights and Choices

How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification

How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Cookies

Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of data on your computer, like when you view a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. Additionally, we may put web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to a Twilio website.
Children
Our Services are not directed to or intended to be used by children (under the age of 13 in the US and UK, or 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly permit children to sign up for a Twilio account. If we become aware that a child has signed up for an account, we will take reasonable steps to deactivate the account and remove their personal data from our records as quickly as possible. If you believe an underage person has signed up for a Twilio account, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
with the subject line “Children”.
Automated Decision Making
Automated decision-making occurs when an electronic system uses personal data to make a decision about you, without human involvement. Twilio uses automated decision-making leveraging a variety of signals derived from records we collect or obtain from third party vendors, to help monitor, identify, and suspend accounts sending spam or engaging in other abusive or fraudulent activity.  We may also use this information to evaluate your account application and make decisions about whether to approve or decline. If your account is suspended or not approved under these circumstances you will be notified and given an opportunity to request human review of the decision.
We may rely on other automated decision-making where:
We have notified you of the decision and provided you with the opportunity to request a human review of the decision
It is necessary to perform a contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights
We have your consent and we have put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights

Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.
