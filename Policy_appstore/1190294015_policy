We do not knowingly sell the Personal Data of minors under age 18.
Response to Requests.
For an explanation of the rights you may have as a California resident, please see the Your Rights and Choices section above.

X Datenschutzrichtlinien
G√ºltig ab: 15. November 2024
Vor dem Scrollen bitte lesen
Es ist wirklich schwer, alle mit einer Datenschutzerkl√§rung zufrieden zu stellen. Die meisten Personen, die X nutzen, wollen etwas Kurzes und leicht Verst√§ndliches. Wir w√ºnschten zwar, wir k√∂nnten alles, was Sie wissen m√ºssen, in einen Post packen, aber unsere Regulierungsbeh√∂rden verlangen von uns, dass wir unseren rechtlichen Verpflichtungen nachkommen und alle Richtlinien sehr detailliert beschreiben.
Aus diesem Grund haben wir unsere Datenschutzrichtlinien so einfach wie m√∂glich formuliert, damit Sie in der Lage sind, informierte Entscheidungen zu treffen, wenn Sie X nutzen. Unser Ziel ist, dass Sie verstehen, welche Daten wir erfassen, wie sie genutzt und wann sie weitergegeben werden, und dass Sie Kontrolle dar√ºber haben.
Wenn Sie also nicht jedes Wort der Datenschutzerkl√§rung lesen, sollten Sie wenigstens Folgendes wissen:
X ist eine √∂ffentliche Plattform
Erfahren Sie, was angezeigt und durchsucht werden kann
Wir erheben einige Daten

Erfahren Sie, was¬†wir erfassen und wie
Dienste unserer verbundenen Unternehmen k√∂nnen ihre eigenen Richtlinien haben

Wir verwenden Ihre Daten zur Verbesserung von X
Erfahren Sie, wie wir Ihre Daten nutzen
Sie haben die Kontrolle √ºber Ihr Erlebnis
Erfahren Sie, wie Sie Ihre Einstellungen aktualisieren

1. Daten, die wir erheben
Die Daten, die wir erheben, wenn Sie X nutzen, lassen sich in drei Kategorien unterteilen.
1.1 Daten, die Sie uns zur Verf√ºgung stellen.
Zur Nutzung einiger unserer Produkte und Dienste ben√∂tigen Sie einen Account, und zur Erstellung eines Accounts m√ºssen Sie uns bestimmte Daten zur Verf√ºgung stellen. Gleichfalls k√∂nnen wir, wenn Sie unsere kostenpflichtigen Produkte und Dienste nutzen, Ihnen diese nicht zur Verf√ºgung stellen, wenn wir Ihre Zahlungsdaten nicht erhalten. Grunds√§tzlich brauchen wir f√ºr viele unserer Produkte und Dienste bestimmte Daten, damit Sie sie nutzen k√∂nnen.
Pers√∂nliche Accounts.
Wenn Sie einen Account erstellen, m√ºssen Sie uns einige Daten zur Verf√ºgung stellen, damit wir Ihnen unsere Dienste bereitstellen k√∂nnen. Dazu geh√∂ren ein Anzeigename (zum Beispiel ‚ÄûGestalter*innen‚Äú); ein Nutzername (zum Beispiel @XGestalter*innen); ein Passwort; eine E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer; ein Geburtsdatum, Ihre Anzeigesprache und Daten zur einmaligen Anmeldung bei Dritten (wenn Sie diese Anmeldemethode w√§hlen). Sie k√∂nnen sich auch daf√ºr entscheiden, Ihren Standort in Ihrem Profil und in Ihren Posts zu teilen und Ihr Adressbuch auf X hochzuladen, damit Sie leichter nach Personen suchen k√∂nnen, die Sie kennen. Ihre Profildaten, einschlie√ülich Ihres Anzeigenamens und Ihres Nutzernamens, sind immer √∂ffentlich, aber Sie k√∂nnen entweder Ihren echten Namen oder ein Pseudonym verwenden. Denken Sie auch daran, dass Sie mehrere X Accounts einrichten k√∂nnen, zum Beispiel wenn Sie verschiedene Aspekte Ihrer Identit√§t zum Ausdruck bringen m√∂chten, sei es beruflich oder anderweitig.
Professionelle Accounts.
Wenn Sie einen
professionellen Account
einrichten, m√ºssen Sie uns auch eine professionelle Kategorie angeben und k√∂nnen uns weitere Daten zur Verf√ºgung stellen, einschlie√ülich Postanschrift, Kontakt-E-Mail-Adresse und Kontakt-Telefonnummer. Alle diese Daten sind immer √∂ffentlich.
Zahlungsdaten.
Wenn Sie Werbeanzeigen oder andere Angebote kaufen m√∂chten, die im Rahmen unserer kostenpflichtigen Produkte und Dienste zur Verf√ºgung gestellt werden, m√ºssen Sie uns Zahlungsdaten zur Verf√ºgung stellen, einschlie√ülich Ihrer Kredit- oder Debitkartennummer, des Ablaufdatums der Karte, des CVV-Codes und der Rechnungsadresse.
Bevorzugte Einstellungen.
Wenn Sie in Ihren
Einstellungen
bestimmte Pr√§ferenzen angeben, erheben wir diese Daten, damit wir Ihre W√ºnsche ber√ºcksichtigen k√∂nnen.
Biometrische Informationen.
Wenn Sie dazu Ihre Einwilligung gegeben haben, k√∂nnen wir Ihre biometrischen Daten zu Sicherheits- und Identifikationszwecken erfassen und verwenden.
Stellenbewerbungen/Empfehlungen.
Wir k√∂nnen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten (z.¬†B. Informationen aus Ihrer Biografie, Ihren beruflichen Werdegang, Ihren Bildungsgang, Ihre Besch√§ftigungspr√§ferenzen, F√§higkeiten und Fertigkeiten oder Ihre Aktivit√§t und Interaktionen bei der Stellensuche, zus√§tzlich zu den Informationen, die wir bereits gem√§√ü dem Abschnitt ‚ÄûDaten, die wir erheben, wenn Sie X nutzen‚Äú unserer Datenschutzerkl√§rung weiter unten erfassen) daf√ºr erfassen und heranziehen, Ihnen potenzielle Jobs zu empfehlen, sie an potenzielle Arbeitgeber weiterzuleiten, wenn Sie sich auf eine Stelle bewerben, sodass Arbeitgeber potenzielle Kandidat*innen finden k√∂nnen, und Ihnen relevantere Werbung zu zeigen.
1.2¬†Daten, die wir erheben, wenn Sie X nutzen.
Wenn Sie unsere Dienste nutzen, erheben wir Daten dar√ºber, wie Sie unsere Produkte und Dienste nutzen. Mithilfe dieser Daten stellen wir Ihnen Produkte und Dienste zur Verf√ºgung und tragen dazu bei, dass X sicherer und respektvoller f√ºr alle und relevanter f√ºr Sie ist.
Nutzungsinformationen.
Wir erfassen Informationen √ºber Ihre Aktivit√§ten auf X, darunter:
Von Ihnen gepostete Beitr√§ge und andere Inhalte (einschlie√ülich Datum, Anwendung und Version von X) sowie Informationen zu Ihrer Broadcast-Aktivit√§t (z.¬†B. Spaces), einschlie√ülich von Ihnen erstellter Broadcasts und deren Erstellungszeitpunkt, Ihrer Listen, Lesezeichen und Communities, denen Sie angeh√∂ren.
Ihre Interaktionen mit den Inhalten anderer Nutzer*innen, wie z.¬†B. Reposts, ‚ÄûGef√§llt mir‚Äú-Angaben, Lesezeichen, geteilten Inhalten, Downloads, Antworten, wenn andere Nutzer*innen Sie in Inhalten erw√§hnen oder markieren oder wenn Sie sie erw√§hnen oder markieren, und Broadcasts, an denen Sie teilgenommen haben (einschlie√ülich Ihres Verlaufs in Bezug auf angesehene/angeh√∂rte Inhalte, Kommentare, Sprechbeitr√§ge und Reaktionen).
Wie Sie mit anderen auf der Plattform interagieren, beispielsweise mit Personen, denen Sie folgen, und Personen, die Ihnen folgen, Metadaten in Bezug auf
verschl√ºsselte Nachrichten
und, wenn Sie
Direktnachrichten
verwenden, auch den Inhalt der Nachrichten, die Empf√§nger*innen sowie Datum und Uhrzeit der Nachrichten.
Wenn Sie mit uns kommunizieren, beispielsweise per E-Mail, erheben wir Daten √ºber die Kommunikation und deren Inhalt.
Wir erheben Daten √ºber Links, mit denen Sie in unseren Diensten interagieren (auch in den E-Mails, die wir Ihnen schicken).
K√§ufe und Zahlungen.
Damit Sie unter Verwendung von X-Funktionen oder -Diensten eine Zahlung t√§tigen oder Geld senden k√∂nnen, auch √ºber einen Vermittler, erhalten wir m√∂glicherweise Informationen zu Ihrer Transaktion, etwa wann sie get√§tigt wurde, wann ein Abonnement abl√§uft oder automatisch verl√§ngert wird und welche Betr√§ge gezahlt oder erhalten wurden.
Ger√§tedaten.
Wir erfassen Informationen von und √ºber die Ger√§te, die Sie f√ºr den Zugriff auf X verwenden, darunter:
Daten √ºber Ihre Verbindung, wie beispielsweise Ihre IP-Adresse, den Browsertyp und verwandte Informationen.
Daten √ºber Ihr Ger√§t und seine Einstellungen, wie beispielsweise Ger√§te- und Werbe-ID, Betriebssystem, Anbieter, Sprache, Speicher, installierte Apps und Akkustand.
Das Adressbuch Ihres Ger√§ts, wenn Sie sich dazu entschieden haben, es mit uns zu teilen.
Standortinformationen.
Wenn Sie X verwenden, erfassen wir einige Informationen zu Ihrem ungef√§hren Standort, um Ihnen den erwarteten Dienst bereitzustellen, einschlie√ülich der Anzeige relevanter Werbung. Sie k√∂nnen auch w√§hlen, ob Sie Ihren aktuellen genauen Standort oder Orte, an denen Sie X zuvor genutzt haben, teilen m√∂chten, indem Sie diese Einstellungen in Ihrem Account aktivieren.
Abgeleitete Identit√§t.
Wir k√∂nnen Informationen sammeln oder erhalten, die wir verwenden, um auf Ihre Identit√§t zu schlie√üen, wie unten beschrieben:
Wenn Sie sich mit einem Browser oder Ger√§t bei X anmelden, verkn√ºpfen wir diesen Browser oder dieses Ger√§t mit Ihrem Account. Vorbehaltlich Ihrer Einstellungen k√∂nnen wir Ihren Account auch mit anderen Browsern oder Ger√§ten verkn√ºpfen als mit denen, die Sie f√ºr die Anmeldung bei X nutzen (oder Ihr abgemeldetes Ger√§t oder Ihren Browser mit anderen Browsern oder Ger√§ten oder von X generierten Identifikatoren verkn√ºpfen).
Wenn Sie X andere Daten zur Verf√ºgung stellen, einschlie√ülich einer E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer, verkn√ºpfen wir diese Daten mit Ihrem X Account. Vorbehaltlich Ihrer Einstellungen k√∂nnen wir anhand dieser Daten auch andere Daten √ºber Ihre Identit√§t ableiten, zum Beispiel indem wir Ihren Account mit Hashes von E-Mail-Adressen verkn√ºpfen, die gemeinsame Komponenten mit der E-Mail-Adresse haben, die Sie X zur Verf√ºgung gestellt haben.
Wenn Sie auf X zugreifen und nicht angemeldet sind, k√∂nnen wir anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten R√ºckschl√ºsse auf Ihre Identit√§t ziehen.
Protokollinformationen.
Wenn Sie Inhalte auf unseren Produkten und Diensten ansehen oder auf andere Weise mit ihnen interagieren, erhalten wir m√∂glicherweise Informationen, auch wenn Sie keinen Account erstellt haben oder abgemeldet sind, beispielsweise:
IP-Adresse und zugeh√∂rige Informationen; Browsertyp und -sprache; Betriebssystem; die verweisende Webseite; Zugriffszeiten; besuchte Seiten; Standort; Ihr Mobilfunkanbieter; Ger√§teinformationen (einschlie√ülich Ger√§te- und Anwendungs-IDs); Suchbegriffe und IDs (einschlie√ülich derjenigen, die nicht als Abfragen √ºbermittelt wurden); Ihnen auf X angezeigte Anzeigen; von X generierte Kennungen; und mit Cookies verkn√ºpfte Kennungen. Wir erhalten Protokolldaten auch, wenn Sie auf Links in unseren Diensten klicken, sich diese ansehen oder mit ihnen interagieren, u.¬†a. wenn Sie eine andere Applikation √ºber X installieren.
Werbung.
Wenn Sie Werbung ansehen oder mit ihr interagieren, die wir auf oder au√üerhalb von X bereitstellen, erfassen wir m√∂glicherweise Informationen zu diesen Ansichten oder Interaktionen (z.¬†B. Ansehen einer Videoanzeige oder eines Prerolls, Anklicken einer Anzeige, Interagieren mit Reposts oder Antworten auf eine Anzeige).
Cookies und √§hnliche Technologien.
Wie viele Websites verwenden wir Cookies und √§hnliche Technologien, um zus√§tzliche Daten zur Website-Nutzung zu sammeln und unsere Dienste zu betreiben. F√ºr viele Teile unserer Produkte und Dienste, wie etwa die Suche und Anzeige √∂ffentlicher Profile, sind Cookies nicht erforderlich. Weitere Informationen zur Verwendung von Cookies und √§hnlichen Technologien finden Sie
hier
.
Interaktionen mit unseren Inhalten auf Websites Dritter.
Wenn Sie sich unsere Inhalte auf Websites von Dritten ansehen, die X Inhalte wie eingebettete Timelines oder Buttons zum Posten integrieren, k√∂nnen wir Protokolldaten erhalten, einschlie√ülich der von Ihnen besuchten Webseite.
1.3 Daten, die wir von Dritten erhalten.
Wenn Sie andere Online-Produkte und -Dienste nutzen, k√∂nnen sie Daten √ºber diese Nutzung an uns weitergeben.
Werbepartner, Entwickler, Verleger.
Unsere Werbe- und Gesch√§ftspartner geben Daten wie Browser-Cookie-IDs, von X generierte Identifikatoren,
IDs von Mobilger√§ten, gehashte Nutzerdaten wie E-Mail-Adressen, demografische Daten oder Interessensdaten sowie auf einer Website oder App angesehene Inhalte oder durchgef√ºhrte Aktionen an uns weiter. Einige unserer Werbepartner, insbesondere unsere Werbekunden, erm√∂glichen es uns auch, √§hnliche Daten direkt von ihrer Website oder App zu erheben, indem sie unsere Werbetechnologie integrieren. Daten, die von Werbepartnern und verbundenen Unternehmen weitergegeben oder von X von den Websites und Apps der Werbepartner und verbundenen Unternehmen erhoben werden, k√∂nnen mit den anderen Daten kombiniert werden, die Sie mit X teilen und die X erh√§lt,
generiert oder
√ºber Sie ableitet, wie an anderer Stelle in diesen Datenschutzrichtlinien beschrieben.
Andere Dritte, Account-Verbindungen und Integrationen.
Wir k√∂nnen Daten √ºber Sie von Dritten erhalten, die nicht unsere Werbepartner sind, wie beispielsweise von anderen X Nutzer*innen, Entwickler*innen und Partner*innen, die uns helfen, die Sicherheit und Qualit√§t von Inhalten auf unserer Plattform zu bewerten, von unseren
verbundenen Unternehmen
und von anderen Diensten, die Sie mit Ihrem X Account verkn√ºpfen. Sie k√∂nnen sich entscheiden, Ihren X Account mit Ihrem Account bei einem anderen Dienst zu verbinden und dieser andere Dienst kann uns Daten √ºber Ihren Account bei diesem Dienst senden.
2. Wie wir Daten verwenden
Aufgrund der Funktionsweise der Systeme, die unsere Dienste f√ºr Sie anbieten, ist es nicht einfach, die Verwendung der von uns erhobenen Daten aufzuschl√ºsseln. So kann beispielsweise dieselbe Dateninformation in verschiedener Art und Weise f√ºr verschiedene Zwecke verwendet werden, damit letztlich ein einziger Dienst erbracht werden kann. Am zweckdienlichsten ist es wahrscheinlich, die f√ºnf wichtigsten Arten und Weisen zu erl√§utern, in der wir Daten verwenden. Wenn Sie Fragen haben, die nicht beantwortet werden, k√∂nnen Sie uns jederzeit
kontaktieren
. Mehr im Folgenden:
2.1 Betreiben, Verbessern und Personalisieren unserer Dienste.
Die von uns erhobenen Daten nutzen wir zur Bereitstellung und zum Betrieb der X Produkte und Dienste. Au√üerdem verbessern und personalisieren wir mit den erhobenen Daten unsere Produkte und Dienste, damit Sie ein besseres Erlebnis auf X haben, u.¬†a. indem wir Ihnen relevantere Inhalte und Werbung zeigen, Ihnen Personen und Themen vorschlagen, denen Sie folgen k√∂nnen, und Ihnen helfen,
verbundene Unternehmen
, Apps von Dritten und Dienste zu entdecken. Wir k√∂nnen die Daten, die wir erheben, und √∂ffentlich verf√ºgbare Daten zum Training unserer Modelle f√ºr Maschinenlernen oder k√ºnstliche Intelligenz f√ºr die in dieser Richtlinie dargelegten Zwecke heranziehen.
Wir k√∂nnen die Daten, die wir von Accounts anderer Dienste erheben, bei denen Sie sich zur Verkn√ºpfung mit Ihrem X Accounts entschieden haben, heranziehen, damit wir Ihnen Funktionen wie dienst√ºbergreifendes Posting oder dienst√ºbergreifende Authentifizierung bieten und unsere Dienste betreiben k√∂nnen.
Anhand Ihrer Kontaktdaten helfen wir anderen, Ihren Account zu finden, wenn Ihre Einstellungen dies zulassen, u.¬†a. √ºber Dienste von Dritten und Client-Applikationen.
Vorbehaltlich Ihrer
Einstellungen
stellen wir mithilfe Ihrer Daten unsere Dienste f√ºr Werbung und gesponserte Inhalte bereit, was dabei hilft, die Werbeanzeigen auf X f√ºr Sie relevanter zu gestalten. Anhand dieser Daten messen wir auch die Effektivit√§t von Werbeanzeigen und helfen, Ihre Ger√§te zu erkennen, damit wir Werbeanzeigen auf und au√üerhalb von X f√ºr Sie schalten k√∂nnen. Einige unserer Werbepartner erm√∂glichen es uns auch, √§hnliche Daten direkt von ihrer Website oder App zu erheben, indem sie unsere Werbetechnologie integrieren. Daten, die von Werbepartnern und verbundenen Unternehmen weitergegeben oder von X von den Websites und Apps der Werbepartner und verbundenen Unternehmen erhoben werden, k√∂nnen mit den anderen Daten kombiniert werden, die Sie mit X teilen und die X erh√§lt, generiert oder √ºber Sie ableitet, wie an anderer Stelle in unseren Datenschutzrichtlinien beschrieben.
2.2¬† Sicherheit und Schutz f√∂rdern.
Anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten sorgen wir f√ºr den Schutz und die Sicherheit unserer Nutzer*innen, unserer Produkte, unserer Dienste und Ihres Accounts. Dazu geh√∂ren die √úberpr√ºfung Ihrer Identit√§t, die Authentifizierung Ihres Accounts und die Abwehr von Betrug, unbefugter Nutzung und illegalen Aktivit√§ten. Au√üerdem bewerten und beeinflussen wir mithilfe der Daten die Sicherheit und Qualit√§t der Inhalte auf X. Das beinhaltet die Untersuchung und Durchsetzung unserer Richtlinien und AGB sowie des geltenden Rechts.
2.3 Messen, Analysieren und Verbessern unserer Dienst.
Anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten messen und analysieren wir die Effektivit√§t unserer Produkte und Dienste und lernen besser verstehen, wie Sie sie nutzen, damit wir sie weiter verbessern k√∂nnen.
2.4 Kommunikation mit Ihnen √ºber unsere Dienste.
Anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten kommunizieren wir mit Ihnen √ºber unsere Produkte und Dienste, u.¬†a. √ºber Produktaktualisierungen und √Ñnderungen unserer Richtlinien und AGB. Wenn Sie sich daf√ºr entscheiden, k√∂nnen wir Ihnen auch gelegentlich Marketingnachrichten schicken.
2.5 Forschung.
Anhand der Daten, die Sie uns mitteilen oder die wir erheben, f√ºhren wir Forschung, Umfragen, Produkttests und Fehlerbehebungen durch, die uns helfen, unsere Produkte und Dienste zu betreiben und zu verbessern.
3. Weitergabe von Daten
Sie sollten wissen, auf welche Weise wir Ihre Daten weitergeben, warum wir sie weitergeben und wie Sie dies beeinflussen k√∂nnen. Es gibt f√ºnf grunds√§tzliche M√∂glichkeiten, wie wir Ihre Daten weitergeben.
3.1¬†Wenn Sie posten und teilen.
An die breite √ñffentlichkeit
.¬†Sie weisen uns an, diese Daten so weit wie m√∂glich offenzulegen. Die Inhalte von X, einschlie√ülich Ihrer Profildaten (z.¬†B. Name/Pseudonym, Nutzername, Profilbilder), sind f√ºr die breite √ñffentlichkeit zur Ansicht zug√§nglich. Die √ñffentlichkeit muss sich nicht anmelden, um einen Teil der Inhalte auf X zu sehen. X Inhalte sind auch au√üerhalb von X auffindbar, zum Beispiel √ºber die Ergebnisse von Suchanfragen in Internet-Suchmaschinen oder in Videos, die heruntergeladen und anderswo geteilt wurden (abh√§ngig von Ihren
Einstellungen
).
An andere X Nutzer*innen.
Abh√§ngig von Ihren
Einstellungen
und basierend auf den X Produkten und Diensten, die Sie nutzen, geben wir Folgendes weiter:
Ihre Interaktionen mit X-Inhalten anderer Benutzer, z.¬†B. Antworten und Personen, denen Sie folgen.
Inhalte, die Sie an bestimmte X Nutzer*innen senden, wie beispielsweise √ºber
Direktnachrichten
. Zur Beachtung: Wenn Sie Daten wie Direktnachrichten oder gesch√ºtzte Posts mit einer Person geteilt haben, die √ºber einen Dienst eines Dritten auf X zugreift, k√∂nnen die Daten an den Dienst des Dritten weitergegeben werden.
An Partner.
Abh√§ngig von Ihren
Einstellungen
stellen wir auch bestimmten Dritten Daten zur Verf√ºgung, damit sie uns beim Angebot oder Betrieb unserer Produkte und Dienste unterst√ºtzen. In unserem
Hilfe-Center
erfahren Sie mehr √ºber diese Partnerschaften. Ob X Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an diese Partner weitergibt, steuern Sie √ºber die Option ‚ÄûDatenaustausch mit Gesch√§ftspartnern‚Äú in Ihren
Einstellungen f√ºr Datenschutz und Sicherheit
.¬†(Diese Einstellung steuert nicht die Weitergabe, die an anderer Stelle in diesen Datenschutzrichtlinien beschrieben wird, wie beispielsweise wenn wir Daten mit unseren Dienstleistern oder durch andere als die in diesem
Hilfe-Center
-Artikel beschriebenen Partnerschaften teilen.)
3.2 Mit Drittanbietern und Drittanbieterintegrationen.
An Dienstleister.
Wir k√∂nnen Ihre Daten an unsere
Dienstleister
weitergeben, die in unserem Auftrag Funktionen und Dienste erbringen, u.a. Zahlungsdienstleister, die Zahlungen erm√∂glichen; Servicepartner, die unsere verschiedenen Blogs und Wikis hosten; Servicepartner, die uns helfen, die Nutzung unserer Dienste zu verstehen, Anbieter von Bewerberverfolgungssystemen, die Bewerber- und Stellendaten an m√∂gliche Arbeitgeber versenden und von ihnen enthalten,¬†und solche, die Betrugserkennungsdienste anbieten.
An Werbekunden.
Werbeeinnahmen erm√∂glichen es uns, unsere Produkte und Dienste zur Verf√ºgung zu stellen. Werbekunden k√∂nnen Daten aus Ihrer Interaktion mit ihren Werbeanzeigen auf oder au√üerhalb von X erhalten. Wenn Sie beispielsweise in unseren Diensten auf einen externen Link oder eine Werbeanzeige klicken, kann der Werbekunde oder der Betreiber der Website herausfinden, dass Sie von X gekommen sind, zusammen mit anderen Daten, die mit der Werbeanzeige, auf die Sie geklickt haben, verkn√ºpft sind, wie beispielsweise Merkmale der Zielgruppe, die damit erreicht werden sollte, und andere von X generierte Identifikatoren f√ºr diese Werbeanzeige. Sie k√∂nnen auch andere personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen erheben, wie beispielsweise Cookie-Identifikatoren oder Ihre IP-Adresse.
Inhalte und Integrationen von Dritten.
Wir geben Ihre Daten mit Ihrer Einwilligung oder auf Ihre Anweisung hin weiter oder legen diese offen, beispielsweise wenn Sie
einen Web-Client oder eine Applikation eines Dritten autorisieren
, auf Ihren Account zuzugreifen, oder uns anweisen, Ihr Feedback an ein Unternehmen weiterzugeben. Gleichfalls arbeiten wir zur Verbesserung Ihrer Nutzung mit Dritten zusammen, damit ihre Videoinhalte auf X angezeigt oder Inhalte plattform√ºbergreifend geteilt werden k√∂nnen. Wenn Sie sich Inhalte unserer Videopartner oder plattform√ºbergreifenden Partner ansehen oder anderweitig mit diesen interagieren, k√∂nnen diese Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erhalten und verarbeiten, wie in ihren Datenschutzerkl√§rungen beschrieben. F√ºr Videoinhalte k√∂nnen Sie Ihre
Autoplay-Einstellungen
anpassen, wenn Sie m√∂chten, dass die Inhalte nicht automatisch abgespielt werden.
Kooperation mit Dritten.
Wenn Sie die entsprechenden
Einstellungen
vorgenommen haben oder sich dazu entschlie√üen, Ihre Daten weiterzugeben, k√∂nnen wir Ihre Informationen an Dritte weitergeben oder offenlegen. Wenn Sie sich nicht abmelden, k√∂nnen die Empf√§nger der Informationen diese in einigen F√§llen zus√§tzlich zu den in der Datenschutzrichtlinie von X genannten Zwecken auch f√ºr ihre eigenen unabh√§ngigen Zwecke verwenden, darunter beispielsweise zum Trainieren ihrer Modelle k√ºnstlicher Intelligenz, ob generativ oder anderweitig.
Durch unsere APIs.
Wir verwenden Technologien wie
APIs
und Einbettungen zur Bereitstellung √∂ffentlicher X Daten f√ºr Websites, Apps und andere zu ihrer Nutzung, zum Beispiel damit Posts auf einer Nachrichten-Website angezeigt werden k√∂nnen oder damit analysiert werden kann, was Personen auf X √§u√üern. Wir stellen diese Inhalte in der Regel in begrenztem Umfang kostenlos zur Verf√ºgung und erheben Lizenzgeb√ºhren f√ºr den Zugriff in gro√üem Umfang. Wir haben
Standard
-Gesch√§ftsbedingungen, die regeln, wie diese Daten verwendet werden k√∂nnen, und ein Compliance-Programm zur Durchsetzung dieser Bedingungen. Diese Personen und Unternehmen sind jedoch nicht mit X verbunden und ihre Angebote spiegeln m√∂glicherweise nicht die Aktualisierungen wider, die Sie auf X vornehmen. Weitere Informationen dar√ºber, wie wir der Welt √∂ffentliche Daten auf X zur Verf√ºgung stellen, finden Sie unter
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 In F√§llen, in denen es gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist, zur Verhinderung von Schaden oder im √∂ffentlichen Interesse.
Wir k√∂nnen Ihre Daten aufbewahren, verwenden, weitergeben oder offenlegen, wenn wir glauben, dass es f√ºr einen der folgenden Zwecke vern√ºnftigerweise notwendig ist:
zur Einhaltung eines Gesetzes, einer Verordnung oder
zur Erf√ºllung eines rechtsg√ºltigen Verfahrens oder einer beh√∂rdlichen Anfrage
zum Schutz der Sicherheit einer Person, zum Schutz der Sicherheit oder Integrit√§t unserer Plattform, u.¬†a. zur Verhinderung von Spam, Missbrauch oder b√∂swilligen Akteuren auf unseren Diensten
Erkl√§ren, warum wir Inhalte oder Konten aus unseren Diensten entfernt haben (z.¬†B. wegen eines Versto√ües gegen
unsere Regeln
);
zur L√∂sung von Problemen mit Betrug und Sicherheit oder technischen Problemen
zum Schutz unserer Rechte oder unseres Eigentum oder der Rechte oder des Eigentums der Personen, die unsere Dienste nutzen
Wir k√∂nnen au√üerdem verschiedene Signale und Ihre Daten zur Ableitung, Aufbewahrung, Nutzung, Weiterleitung oder Offenlegung Ihres Alter und Ihrer Identit√§tsinformationen heranziehen, damit wir gesetzliche Vorschriften einhalten k√∂nnen sowie je nach Sachlage im Interesse von Sicherheit, Schutz, Betrugsbek√§mpfung, Sorgfaltspflichten in Bezug auf Kund*innen und Unternehmen sowie zur Identit√§tspr√ºfung. Zu diesen Zwecken k√∂nnen wir Ihre Alters- und Identit√§tsinformationen auch an unsere Partner, Dienstanbieter und andere weitergeben oder offenlegen.
3.4 An unsere verbundenen Unternehmen.
Wir k√∂nnen Daten an unsere
verbundenen Unternehmen
weitergeben, damit unsere Produkte und Dienste zur Verf√ºgung gestellt werden k√∂nnen.
3.5 √Ñnderung der Eigentumsverh√§ltnisse.
Wir k√∂nnen Daten √ºber Sie in Verbindung mit einer Fusion, √úbernahme, Reorganisation, einem Verkauf von Verm√∂genswerten oder einem Konkurs weitergeben, verkaufen oder √ºbertragen. Diese Datenschutzerkl√§rung gilt f√ºr Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, die (vor und nach dem Abschluss einer Transaktion) an das neue Unternehmen weitergegeben oder √ºbertragen werden.
4. Wie lange wir Daten aufbewahren

Wir k√∂nnen von Ihnen verlangen, dass Sie zus√§tzliche Daten zur √úberpr√ºfung zur Verf√ºgung stellen.
6. Ihre und unsere Rechte
Wir stellen X Personen auf der ganzen Welt zur Verf√ºgung und bieten allen unseren Nutzer*innen, unabh√§ngig von ihrem Wohnort, viele der gleichen Datenschutz-Tools und Kontrollm√∂glichkeiten. Es kann jedoch sein, dass sich Ihre Nutzung etwas anders gestaltet als f√ºr Nutzer*innen in anderen L√§ndern. Das soll sicherstellen, dass X die lokalen Anforderungen respektiert.
6.1 Wir st√ºtzen uns bei der Nutzung Ihrer Daten auf bestimmte Rechtsgrundlagen.
X hat die Rechtsgrundlagen, auf deren Grundlage es X erlaubt ist, Ihre Daten zu erheben, zu verwenden, weiterzugeben und anderweitig zu verarbeiten, sorgf√§ltig gepr√ºft. Wenn Sie mehr erfahren und die Feinheiten besser verstehen m√∂chten, empfehlen wir Ihnen, sich diese
zus√§tzlichen Informationen √ºber die Datenverarbeitung
anzusehen. Und nein, wir verkaufen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht.
6.2¬†Wir verlagern Ihre Daten, damit X f√ºr Sie funktioniert.
So wie Sie sich mit X nahtlos an globalen Konversationen mit Personen in L√§ndern auf der ganzen Welt beteiligen, muss X Daten √ºber Grenzen hinweg und in verschiedene L√§nder auf der ganzen Welt verlagern, damit der sichere und zuverl√§ssige Dienst, auf den Sie sich verlassen, m√∂glich wird. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel in Europa leben und eine Konversation mit jemandem in den USA f√ºhren, m√ºssen Daten zwischen diesen L√§ndern ausgetauscht werden, damit die Konversation m√∂glich wird. Das ist es, was Sie von uns erwarten.
Wir nutzen auch Rechenzentren und Cloud-Anbieter und beauftragen
unsere verbundenen Unternehmen
sowie Dritte und
Dienstleister
in vielen Teilen der Welt, damit sie uns bei der Bereitstellung unserer Dienste helfen. Bevor wir Daten zwischen L√§ndern √ºbertragen, pr√ºfen wir die Risiken, die f√ºr die Daten bestehen k√∂nnen, und verlassen uns, sofern zutreffend, auf
Standardvertragsklauseln
(SCCs), um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Datenschutzrechte gesch√ºtzt sind. Um eine Kopie der SCCs anzufordern, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte
hier
. Wenn Daten an Dritte weitergegeben werden, verlangen wir von ihnen, dass sie den gleichen Schutz f√ºr Ihre Daten gew√§hrleisten, wie wir selbst bieten.
X ist an Datenschutz-Rahmenvereinbarungen (Data Privacy Frameworks, DPF) zwischen der EU und den USA und zwischen der Schweiz und den USA und an der Ausweitung des EU-US PDF auf das Vereinigte K√∂nigreich
beteiligt
. X beachtet bei jeglicher Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, die aus der Europ√§ischen Union, der Schweiz und dem Vereinigten K√∂nigreich stammen, die DPF-Prinzipien in Bezug auf die DPF zwischen der EU und den USA bzw. der Schweiz und den USA bzw. in Bezug auf die Ausweitung des EU-US PDF auf das Vereinigte K√∂nigreich.

JAMS
, und unter bestimmten Bedingungen durch das DPF-Schlichtungsverfahren anhand der Verfahren und gem√§√ü den Bedingungen, die in
Anhang¬†1
zu den DPF-Prinzipien beschrieben sind. DPF-Teilnehmer unterliegen den Untersuchungs- und Durchsetzungsbefugnissen der US-amerikanischen Federal Trade Commission und anderer autorisierter gesetzlicher Stellen. Unter bestimmten Umst√§nden k√∂nnen die beteiligten Parteien f√ºr die √úbertragung personenbezogener Daten aus der EU, der Schweiz und dem Vereinigten K√∂nigreich an Dritte au√üerhalb der EU, der Schweiz und des Vereinigten K√∂nigreichs haftbar sein.

whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have
choices
about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide ‚Äúbots‚Äù or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

2.2 Premium Services
Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.

Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include
TeamLink
and
LinkedIn Pages
(e.g., content analytics and followers).
2.3 Communications

We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication

We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of¬†partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
Learn more
about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as ‚Äúad‚Äù or ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services,¬†that action¬†may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is¬†here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members‚Äô data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your¬†data¬†to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g.¬†like, comment, follow,¬†share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and¬†others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies‚Äô or other organizations‚Äô pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that ‚Äúpage owner‚Äù as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another‚Äôs content (including ads), others will be able to view these ‚Äúsocial actions‚Äù and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of¬†Sales Navigator¬†will be asked to share their ‚Äúsocial selling index‚Äù, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others‚Äô Services
You may link your account with others‚Äô services so that they can look up your contacts‚Äô profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it‚Äôs required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention
We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data
You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.

If you choose to close your
LinkedIn
account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have
restricted
your account for breach of our
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache.
