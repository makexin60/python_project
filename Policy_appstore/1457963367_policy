(i) How to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising
At Smart Transfer, we strive to provide you with a personalized and relevant user experience. As part of this, we may use targeted advertising to display ads that are tailored to your interests and preferences. However, we understand that some users may prefer not to receive targeted ads.
If you wish to opt-out of targeted advertising, you can do so by following the instructions below:
Adjust Your Device Settings:
Most mobile devices and web browsers allow you to manage your preferences for personalized advertising. You can visit the settings on your device or browser and opt-out of ad tracking or reset your advertising identifier. Keep in mind that this may not completely stop all ads but will reduce the relevance of ads based on your interests.
Please note that even if you opt-out of targeted advertising, you may still see general advertisements that are not based on your specific interests or preferences. If you have any further queries, you can contact us at
support@smarttransferapp.com
.
