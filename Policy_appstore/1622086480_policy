Fluent Medic doesn’t track any personal information about the user or their device. We do not store or collect any personal information off the device. The patient’s information is kept on the user’s device for 3 hours after it is entered or until another scenario is selected (implying a new patient), whichever comes first. We’ve intentionally designed Fluent Medic to not track any personal information to protect the users’ privacy.
The app anonymously tracks the number of users, what general area in the world they’re using the app and similar non-identifying information to allow us to improve the app and usage experience for our users.
Fluent Medic is designed as a communication aid. It is not a replacement for a qualified translator. Fluent Medic takes no responsibility for misinterpretations or communication errors arising from usage of the app. Responsibility for accurate history taking remains with the clinician.
