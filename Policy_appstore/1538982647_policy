guide about cookies
for further information.
What are cookies and how do we use them?
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which your computer or mobile device downloads when you visit a website. When you return to websites – or visit other websites that use the same cookies – they recognise these cookies and therefore your browsing device.
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how this website is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.
You can learn about the cookies we use and how to manage them below.
We use cookies to:
• Ensure your security and privacy when in our secure sites
• Store login details for our secure sites
• Temporarily store input information in our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstration
• Provide you with ads that are more relevant to you and your interests, and improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites and partner sites
• Improve our understanding of how you navigate through our sites so we can identify improvements
• Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness (we own the anonymous data collected and don't share it with anyone); and
• We use both our own (first-party) and partner companies' (third-party) cookies to support these activities
Managing cookies on this website
We use cookies on our website to make your browsing experience better. By using this website you accept our use of cookies.
You can control how cookies are placed on your device and remove existing cookies; all you have to do is change your web browser settings.
Please be aware that restricting cookies may affect the functionality of this website. For example, you would not be able to log into your Barclaycard account if you disable cookies on your browser.
What type of cookies do we use?
The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into 1 of 4 categories, based on the International Chamber of Commerce guide to cookie categories; Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality and Targeting.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you've asked for can't be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you that is used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.
Performance Cookies
These cookies collect information about how you use a website, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies don’t gather information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how a website works.
These cookies are not used to target you with online marketing. Without these cookies we can't learn how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.
Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news.
These cookies can also be used to remember changes you've made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you've asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymous and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you've previously made or personalise your browsing experience.
Targeting Cookies
These cookies are used to tailor marketing to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Although these cookies can track your visits to other websites, they don’t usually know who you are.
Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.
What happens to cookies that I've downloaded in the past?
Cookies set prior to you changing your settings may still be on your computer. You can remove them using your browser settings.
