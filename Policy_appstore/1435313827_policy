Why use Baristas on Tap?
At Baristas on Tap, our goal is simple: connect highly skilled baristas to spare shifts across the specialty coffee industry. We keep shops covered, whilst allowing baristas the freedom to choose when and where they want to work, with a competitive living wage.
We take our reputation very seriously, and every one of our baristas goes through a multi-step vetting process to ensure they’re suitable to work in each business that uses the service.
Each barista must have a minimum of 2 years of specialty coffee experience, and have developed their skills to an intermediate level in the following:
- Espresso theory (including adjusting to taste and dialling in)
- Filter coffee (hand brewing and batch brewing)
- Latte art (milk texture and pouring, including speed of service)
- Customer service

BOT has made my life so much easier over the past year - from scrambling to fill last minute gaps with our own scarce resources,
              I can now draw on a talented pool of well-qualified baristas to cover sick calls and holidays.
              It has really taken the stress out of staffing, and I can’t imagine going on without it.

Having a pool of very reliable baristas we can work with whenever we fall short is a massive relief, and their
                team has helped us to keep serving coffee every single day non-stop. As an agency they
                work brilliantly; their system is very clear and it has become so popular we can heavily
                rely on booking a barista with them anytime we need to.
