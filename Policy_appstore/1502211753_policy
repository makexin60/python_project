Product
1. What is the best way to choose my size?
Please kindly refer to our

2. Will my item be exactly the same color as what is shown on your website?
Our colour charts online have been adjusted to display colour as close as possible to the colour of the actual fabrics. However, camera resolution and computer monitors can mean the colour may vary slightly between the photos and the actual fabric. Colours are subject to the actual dresses you get. We suggest you order a
fabric swatch
to view colours in person.

4. How can I make sure all of my dresses are the same color?
Colour consistency is of the utmost importance of course. However, there is a chance that there will be slight variations if dresses in same colour submit several orders at different times. Because batches of fabric are produced at different times, the same fabric of the same colour at different times might be slightly different.
You need to order all dresses within 24 hours and contact us to tell us all the dress should be in the same colour. Then, all the dresses will be cut from the same bolt of fabric to make sure they come in the exact same colour.
After 24 hours, we cannot guarantee any late orders will be included in the same dye lot as the rest of your party.
Keep in mind that screen resolutions can alter the way colours look on your computer depending on how you have it set. We always recommend ordering Swatches (free shipping) beforehand so you can see the true colour quality of each fabric in person. Please note that different types of fabrics do take the dye differently, and will not match perfectly.

Returns
1. What is your return policy?
JJ's House will issue a full refund including tax and shipping for any damaged, defective, or mis-shipped items. If your item arrives damaged or defective, please reach out to our Customer Service team directly for assistance with processing your return.
Please keep in mind that all dresses are uniquely made to order to keep costs low for our customers. We also understand that colours on your computer screen can be a little different to how they appear in person. For these reasons, we encourage you to order a
Swatch
(free shipping) to help you decide.
FOR ALL RETURNS:
JJ's House will only issue one prepaid return label per order. You will be responsible for paying shipping fees including, but not limited to, the cost to ship and any shipping materials on additional returns. Because of this, we recommend returning all unwanted items at one time.
FOR ALL STANDARD SIZE DRESSES, SHOES, AND ACCESSORIES:
JJ's House will issue a full refund of the cost of the returned product if you are not satisfied with your item(s). Contact our Customer Service to initiate the return process within 14 days upon receiving your item(s). The item must be returned in its original condition (if eligible per the return policy).
Please note:
* The item must be unworn, unwashed, unaltered, undamaged and with the original tags attached. We cannot process the return of any faulty item.
* Original shipping fee & return shipping fee will not be refunded.
* As all items (including standard size) are made-to-order, we cannot afford to accept the ‘buy-many-keep-one’ purchase. Our customer service team may cancel an order believed to have been made with that intention.
FOR ALL CUSTOM SIZE DRESSES:
At JJ's House, we understand that you may want the dress to ideal fit! To help you out, we offer custom sizing on most of our dresses. Custom sizing takes the same amount of time to make and ship to you!
A few things to remember about custom dresses:
Custom dresses are made specifically to the measurements you provide (bust, waist, hips, height, and hollow-to-floor). That means no one else will be able to wear that dress once it's made. Because of this, we are unable to accept any returns on custom dresses. Please double check your measurements and colour choice before ordering.
We understand that sometimes small alterations are needed, we offer limited alterations reimbursement for only our custom sizes. Simply send us a picture of your receipt from the tailor and your order number and we'll do the rest! Yes, it really is that easy!
FOR ALL PRESONALIZED AND PERSONAL CARE ITEMS:
All personalized and personal care items (including earrings, lingerie, swimwear, etc.) are final sale. Due to hygiene issues there are no returns/exchanges.
FOR ALL SAMPLE SALE ITEMS:
All Sample Sale items are final sale. No returns, no refunds, no exchages.
EXCHANGE POLICY
We do not offer an exchange service for any products at this time. Because all items are made-to-order, we do not have ready-made dresses or products that can be shipped in exchange for your returned items. You will need to return unwanted items (if eligible per the return policy), and then place a new order for the replacement items. All new orders are subject to the current production period.
HOW TO RETURN
1. Submit a return request at Contact Us to Customer Service within 14 days of receiving your order. Please include the reason for return and photographs for verification.
2. Once we have approved your request, you will be sent a return form which needs to be included with your return. Please send your item(s) using local post within 14 days from receiving the return form.
3. When we receive the returned package, the item(s) will be inspected to ensure it is in the original condition and has the issues stated in the return request.
4. Once confirmed, the refund will be credited back to the original payment method within 10-15 days (the processing time depends on your payment method and bank).
Please note:
* We reserve the right to refuse the return if received in an unacceptable condition.
* We cannot process any products that are returned without our prior knowledge.
* We are not liable for return item(s) that are lost or damaged, please keep the receipt with tracking information.
CANCELLATION POLICY
All our items are made-to-order, including standard size items. Once the tailoring process has begun, there will be Labor Costs and Material Costs, with this in mind, please refer to our cancellation policy below:

• Cancel order within 24 hours of payment for a full refund.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.
A. Information Collected
This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Site and does not apply to information collected by JJ's House through any other means.
We collect two types of information from visitors to the Site: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.

"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, date of birth, address, telephone number, email address, company name, photographs and videos. JJ's House collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you provide to us. Here are some examples of how we may collect your personally identifiable information on the site:

(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information
"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Site and a description of how this information is used:
Internet Protocol (IP) address
Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Site to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Site.
Cookie
A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Site. For example, when someone visits a page within the Site, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Site previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Site. Some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, they may contain Demographic Information (defined below) and depending on your browser these cookies may not normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted.
Web Beacons
(also known as "clear gifs", "web bugs" or "pixel tags”)
"Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.
Demographic Information
"Demographic Information" may be your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Site. We use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Site meets your needs. For example, if you subscribe to a specific newsletter, JJ's House may collect your zip code or interests. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information.
The above list provides an example of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Site. And we collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all visitors to our Site. If you do not want JJ's House to have access to this information, please do not visit our Site.

To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that promotion.
To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your personally identifiable information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes. These parties may use your personally identifiable information to contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use such information for their own research, administration or business purposes. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information in this manner, please do not provide us with this information.

We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Site will have access to users' personally identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to us.
To complete your purchase.

To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from the Site. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.

Product
1. What is the best way to choose my size?
Please kindly refer to our
Size Chart
to choose the correct size.
If your measurements align with our size chart, I suggest you choose standard size.

2. Will my item be exactly the same color as what is shown on your website?
Our colour charts online have been adjusted to display colour as close as possible to the colour of the actual fabrics. However, camera resolution and computer monitors can mean the colour may vary slightly between the photos and the actual fabric. Colours are subject to the actual dresses you get. We suggest you order a
fabric swatch
to view colours in person.

3. Could we get color swatches to see what the colors look like in reality?

4. How can I make sure all of my dresses are the same color?
Colour consistency is of the utmost importance of course. However, there is a chance that there will be slight variations if dresses in same colour submit several orders at different times. Because batches of fabric are produced at different times, the same fabric of the same colour at different times might be slightly different.
You need to order all dresses within 24 hours and contact us to tell us all the dress should be in the same colour. Then, all the dresses will be cut from the same bolt of fabric to make sure they come in the exact same colour.
After 24 hours, we cannot guarantee any late orders will be included in the same dye lot as the rest of your party.
Keep in mind that screen resolutions can alter the way colours look on your computer depending on how you have it set. We always recommend ordering Swatches (free shipping) beforehand so you can see the true colour quality of each fabric in person. Please note that different types of fabrics do take the dye differently, and will not match perfectly.

Returns
1. What is your return policy?
JJ's House will issue a full refund including tax and shipping for any damaged, defective, or mis-shipped items. If your item arrives damaged or defective, please reach out to our Customer Service team directly for assistance with processing your return.
Please keep in mind that all dresses are uniquely made to order to keep costs low for our customers. We also understand that colours on your computer screen can be a little different to how they appear in person. For these reasons, we encourage you to order a
Swatch
(free shipping) to help you decide.
FOR ALL RETURNS:
JJ's House will only issue one prepaid return label per order. You will be responsible for paying shipping fees including, but not limited to, the cost to ship and any shipping materials on additional returns. Because of this, we recommend returning all unwanted items at one time.
FOR ALL STANDARD SIZE DRESSES, SHOES, AND ACCESSORIES:
JJ's House will issue a full refund of the cost of the returned product if you are not satisfied with your item(s). Contact our Customer Service to initiate the return process within 14 days upon receiving your item(s). The item must be returned in its original condition (if eligible per the return policy).
Please note:
* The item must be unworn, unwashed, unaltered, undamaged and with the original tags attached. We cannot process the return of any faulty item.
* Original shipping fee & return shipping fee will not be refunded.
* As all items (including standard size) are made-to-order, we cannot afford to accept the ‘buy-many-keep-one’ purchase. Our customer service team may cancel an order believed to have been made with that intention.
FOR ALL CUSTOM SIZE DRESSES:
At JJ's House, we understand that you may want the dress to ideal fit! To help you out, we offer custom sizing on most of our dresses. Custom sizing takes the same amount of time to make and ship to you!
A few things to remember about custom dresses:
Custom dresses are made specifically to the measurements you provide (bust, waist, hips, height, and hollow-to-floor). That means no one else will be able to wear that dress once it's made. Because of this, we are unable to accept any returns on custom dresses. Please double check your measurements and colour choice before ordering.
We understand that sometimes small alterations are needed, we offer limited alterations reimbursement for only our custom sizes. Simply send us a picture of your receipt from the tailor and your order number and we'll do the rest! Yes, it really is that easy!
FOR ALL PRESONALIZED AND PERSONAL CARE ITEMS:
All personalized and personal care items (including earrings, lingerie, swimwear, etc.) are final sale. Due to hygiene issues there are no returns/exchanges.
FOR ALL SAMPLE SALE ITEMS:
All Sample Sale items are final sale. No returns, no refunds, no exchages.
EXCHANGE POLICY
We do not offer an exchange service for any products at this time. Because all items are made-to-order, we do not have ready-made dresses or products that can be shipped in exchange for your returned items. You will need to return unwanted items (if eligible per the return policy), and then place a new order for the replacement items. All new orders are subject to the current production period.
HOW TO RETURN
1. Submit a return request at Contact Us to Customer Service within 14 days of receiving your order. Please include the reason for return and photographs for verification.
2. Once we have approved your request, you will be sent a return form which needs to be included with your return. Please send your item(s) using local post within 14 days from receiving the return form.
3. When we receive the returned package, the item(s) will be inspected to ensure it is in the original condition and has the issues stated in the return request.
4. Once confirmed, the refund will be credited back to the original payment method within 10-15 days (the processing time depends on your payment method and bank).
Please note:
* We reserve the right to refuse the return if received in an unacceptable condition.
* We cannot process any products that are returned without our prior knowledge.
* We are not liable for return item(s) that are lost or damaged, please keep the receipt with tracking information.
CANCELLATION POLICY

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.
A. Information Collected
This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Site and does not apply to information collected by JJ's House through any other means.
We collect two types of information from visitors to the Site: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.

"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, date of birth, address, telephone number, email address, company name, photographs and videos. JJ's House collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you provide to us. Here are some examples of how we may collect your personally identifiable information on the site:

(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information
"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Site and a description of how this information is used:
Internet Protocol (IP) address
Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Site to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Site.
Cookie
A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Site. For example, when someone visits a page within the Site, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Site previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Site. Some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, they may contain Demographic Information (defined below) and depending on your browser these cookies may not normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted.
Web Beacons
(also known as "clear gifs", "web bugs" or "pixel tags”)
"Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.
Demographic Information
"Demographic Information" may be your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Site. We use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Site meets your needs. For example, if you subscribe to a specific newsletter, JJ's House may collect your zip code or interests. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information.
The above list provides an example of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Site. And we collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all visitors to our Site. If you do not want JJ's House to have access to this information, please do not visit our Site.

To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that promotion.
To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your personally identifiable information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes.

We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible.

To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from the Site. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.
