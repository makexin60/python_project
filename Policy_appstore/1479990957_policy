CCTV:
We have CCTV cameras in the lobbies of our hotels, in all entrances to our buildings and in public areas such as our restaurants and loungers.  We use CCTV in order to better ensure the safety and security of our guests and our staff. It is in our legitimate interest to process any personal data captured. Your personal data will not be kept longer than necessary to meet the purposes detailed above. CCTV signage is in place where required by local laws or regulations.
Facial Recognition: We use facial recognition technology to provide a seamless online check-in experience and to personalise your stay with us, including to provide you with mobile room keys (‘Smart Key’) when requested and book chauffeur driven car services. We use this technology to identify you by comparing a photograph that you upload (e.g., a selfie) against a document which you also upload (such as your passport or National ID card). Our staff will not be able to view the photograph you upload; they will verify your identity via your passport or other relevant identification. This technology is only used for selected Dubai hotels. The data collected for this technology is as follows:
●Photograph (e.g., selfie);
●Passport or National ID card; and
●Credit card details (for pre-authorisation purposes only).
Once you have checked-in online, you can activate a Smart Key from the Jumeirah One app. We will use the data provided above to activate the Smart Key. For both Android and iOS devices, we will also ask you to enable your Bluetooth and your permission to use location services. This is because we use Bluetooth Low Energy technology to send messages between our IT servers and the Jumeirah One app to enable the functionality of the Smart Key. The use of Bluetooth Low Energy will determine the proximity between your device and our IT servers but does not collect precise geolocation data. Therefore, your location is never used for tracking purposes or shared with third parties. Once the Smart Key is activated, we will create a unique ID for identifying your device accompanied by your room number to ensure the Smart Key works for your room only. If you wish to share the Smart Key with other guests, we will ask you for their email address and request that they provide us with the same information provided above, therefore they will be subject to facial recognition technology. Please note that if you wish to activate a Smart Key but have not checked-in online, you will also be asked to provide an email address and the information noted above for facial recognition purposes. The Smart Key will not be available to Children.
We rely on your consent to process this personal data for facial recognition technology purposes described in this section above. For special category personal data, we process, we rely on your explicit consent. You are not obliged to use the Jumeirah One app to check-in, and we will only use the facial recognition technology after you have given your consent. Primary Guests can consent through the Jumeirah One app and Secondary Guests through an email sent by us (if provided by the Primary Guest). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Primary Guests can do so through the Jumeirah One app and Secondary Guests by replying to our initial email.
The technology is only used for adult guests in some of our hotels in Dubai and will not be used for guests who are Children. In relation to Children, only photos of identification documents will be collected for check-in purposes on the lawful basis of consent from their parents or relevant persons with parental responsibility for the Children in question. A Child can exercise their data subject rights as described below (under “your rights”).
Your personal data will be shared with our third-party technology partner (for facial recognition) and third-party service providers. As part of the standard check-in process (irrespective of whether you are checking in via the Jumeirah One app), your personal data will also be shared with the Government of Dubai to comply with our legal obligations (the legal basis we rely on for this processing is legal obligation). Primary Guests will receive an alert on the Jumeirah One app when their personal data is shared with the authorities on behalf of all guests in your party.
Your personal data will be deleted 48 hours after you check out unless you have indicated otherwise via the Jumeirah One app. If you have indicated that you consent to your data being retained for a longer period to avoid re-supplying us with your photograph or other personal data on your next visit, your personal data processed for facial recognition purposes will be held for a period of 90 days after you check-out. Any personal data we have shared with the Government of Dubai will be retained by them in line with their own retention policy.
For facial recognition purposes, your data will only be processed in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) and will not be transferred outside of the UAE. However, when activating a Smart Key, the unique ID we have generated for your device and accompanying room number (described above) will be transferred through the USA but not stored outside UAE. No further processing will take place for facial recognition purposes other than as described above. Any personal data collected may be anonymised for research and analytical purposes.
If you have any queries relating to how facial recognition technology is applied to your data or would like to make a request relating to your data, you can contact us via the methods described below (under “contacting us”).

AI Implications
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems:
We use AI Systems that process personal data to enable us to improve our services and user experiences. We remain vigilant when using AI to protect personal data, ensuring customer privacy, and preventing unauthorised or fraudulent activity. Our customers and stakeholders shall remain confident that personal data is adequately protected with us, especially in cases where AI is used to deliver the product or service, as this may infer heightened protection where AI is deployed.
How we use AI Systems
This notice gives you information on how we protect your personal data in our use of the AI System.
Personal data may be processed within our AI Systems. We remain the data controller for your personal data when it is processed while using our AI Systems. We process personal data in accordance with the relevant data protection laws. In the case where we have engaged a processor, we have mandated contracts that uphold our standards in compliance with the relevant data protection laws.
We will sometimes process customers' personal data when using AI Systems. We have regulated the use of AI internally, weighed the opportunities and risks in advance of our use of AI and ensured appropriate human supervision where important matters are concerned. Where we offer dialogues with an AI, we will make this evident and, if necessary, point out potential errors.
Personal Data Processed by AI Systems
We may collect personal data either directly from you, third parties or public sources. We process your personal data using AI Systems to improve the efficiency, quality, and speed of our business processes and for the purpose of providing services. When using AI systems, we may process various types of personal data. For more information, please refer to the section titled "What do we collect from you and how do we use it?".
In limited circumstances, we may process sensitive data through the AI System, but we will ensure that we have the necessary lawful basis in place before doing so. Where we process your existing personal data we will continue to rely on the appropriate lawful basis for that processing activity. In certain instances, we engage data processors; however, they are unable to access any of your personal data entered in the AI Systems. We have mandated contracts with data processors to ensure that your personal data is protected.
