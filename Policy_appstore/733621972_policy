WolfQuest
complies with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by requiring parental consent for both forum accounts and new WQ 2.7 game accounts.
Forum:
When children under the age of 13 register for the forum (which is also a requirement for multiplayer in the old game, v2.5), we ask for the child's email solely in order to send a parental consent form, which the child's parent or guardian may complete an email to us. Upon receipt, we will review the consent form and activate the child's account. If we do not receive parental consent within 14 days, all information in the child's pending forum account  is deleted from our server.
Game Accounts (WQ 2.7):
When children under the age of 13 try to register an account in the game, we require that their parent or guardian provide verified parental consent, via a third-party service, AgeCheq, for this procedure. Please see the
AgeCheq website
for more information on this procedure.
