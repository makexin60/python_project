In the event that Karma makes material changes to the Policy we will make reasonable efforts to notify you prior to such change and update the "Last Updated" date. Once Karma changes the Policy, it will become legally binding on you as of the date of publication (i.e. the new "Last updated" date). Should you not wish to consent to the changes in the Policy you should stop using the Games. This Policy applies to people who use the Games and people who make complaints to us by e-mail. If you do not agree to those changes (regardless of whether you e-mail us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using all Games: in order to make the Games work properly Karma needs to have a regularised set of rules applying to all users.
This Policy applies to the Games, plus all other Karma products and services, including (but not limited to) user accounts, customer and technical support, official forums, wikis, blogs and social media services.
This Policy governs personal information (or, in the United States of America, personally identifiable information) and non-personal information (or, in the United States of America, non-personally identifiable information), which Karma collects from you when you are using the Games ("personal information" means information, which, on its own or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you).

Please be aware that it is the platform providers (Apple AppStore, Google Play, Windows Phone, Android AppStore, Amazon AppStore, etc.) and not Karma who control the payment process for in-app purchases. Therefore, any and all queries or application for refunds should be made directly to the platform provider.
