6. Klarna’s profiling and automated decisions that significantly affect you.
6.1 Klarna’s profiling of you as a customer.
“Profiling” means an automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal matters, for example, by analysing or predicting your personal preferences, such as buying interests. At the same time, we compare your data with what our other customers, with similar use of our services, have preferred.
The purpose of Klarna’s profiling and the personal data types used for each occasion and for each profiling are described in detail in
section 4
above. You can match the below descriptions with the purposes in section 4 above using the numbers in brackets “
[x]
”. The profiling for these purposes does not have a significant impact on you as a customer.
We use profiling for the following purposes:
to deliver our customised services, which customise their content and recommendations based on what we think is most interesting or relevant to you (this applies to the Klarna mobile application, its various functions such as the product expert and shopping assistants, when you interact with our customer service assistant and the order different payment methods appear at Klarna’s checkout), (Purposes [19, 38, 47, 50 and 57] in section 4)
to determine which is the most efficient way to contact you about your outstanding debt (looking at different channels, for example by sms or email, or the timing of such communication), (Purpose [25] in section 4) and
to deliver customised marketing to you across both our own and external platforms and services.  (Purposes [13 and 43] in section 4)
Our services utilise machine learning models and artificial intelligence models in order to provide you with as relevant content as possible.
If you have any questions about how the profiling process works, please contact us. Contact information is available in
section 12
. You may object to our marketing profiling at any time by contacting us (and we will then cease profiling for marketing purposes). You may also end our profiling for our services by terminating the service.
6.2 Klarna’s automated decisions that significantly affect you.
Automated decisions with legal effect, or automated decisions that similarly significantly affect you, means that certain decisions in our services are completely automated, without our employees being involved. These decisions have a significant effect on you as a customer, comparable to legal effects. By making such decisions automatically, Klarna increases its objectivity and transparency in the decision to offer you these services. At the same time, you have the right to object to these decisions at all times. You can read about how to object to these decisions at the end of this section 6.2. When doing these assessments we utilise machine learning models and artificial intelligence models in order to ensure as high quality as possible in our decisions.
Automated decisions that significantly affect you also mean that profiling is performed based on your data before the decision is made. This profiling is made to assess your financial situation (before the decision to offer or grant credit, or initiate a payment), to identify whether your use of our services involves a risk of fraud or money laundering or to decide whether you are liable for a purchase. We profile your user behaviour and financial standing and compare this data with behaviours and conditions that indicate different risk levels for us.
The different user behaviour and conditions are evaluated and weighted into our automated decision-models, so that we end up with a totalling score, which then results in either accepting or rejecting your use of our Services. We can also choose to request further identification from you, if we are not sure who you are.
When does Klarna take automated decisions that significantly affect you?
The personal data types used in each decision are described in section 4. You can match the below descriptions with the purposes in section 4 above using the numbers in brackets
“[x]”
.
We make this kind of automated decision when we:
decide to approve your application, or to offer you,  to use a credit service.
decide
not
to approve your application, or
not
to offer you, to use a credit service.
These automated credit decisions are based on the data you provide to us, data from external sources such as credit bureaus' credit worthiness reports, and Klarna’s own internal information about you if we have lent you money before. In addition to information about you, Klarna’s credit model includes a large number of other factors, such as Klarna’s internal credit risk levels and our customers’ general repayment rates (based on, for example, the current product category).  (Purposes [24 and 31] in section 4).
decide whether you pose a risk of fraud, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates possible fraudulent conduct, that your behaviour is not consistent with previous use of our services, or that you have attempted to conceal your true identity. Automated decisions whereby we assess whether you constitute a fraud risk are based on information you have provided yourself, data from fraud prevention agencies (see section 7.2.3. for details of which ones we use), and Klarna’s own internal information. Klarna continuously develops our fraud models to keep our services secure, and closely investigate how fraudsters operate on different markets (for example which merchant categories or products are mostly subject to fraud attempts). (Purposes [5, 21 and 41] in section 4).
decide whether there is a risk of money laundering, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates money laundering. In relevant cases, Klarna also investigates whether specific customers are listed on sanction lists. (Purposes [20, 29 and 34] in section 4).
decide whether you are liable for a purchase that you have disputed as “unauthorised” based on whether the information you provide, or we have about the purchase, point towards potential fraudulent behaviour or not. This by comparing what has happened in your case to other transactions indicating fraudulent behaviour. (Purpose [46] in section 4).
See
section 7
for more information about whom we share information with as regards profiling during automated decisions.
If you are not approved under the automated decisions described above, you will not have access to, or will not be able to use Klarna’s services, such as our payment methods. Klarna has several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate and fair. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can always contact us, and we will determine whether the procedure was performed appropriately. You can also object in accordance with the following instructions.
Your right to object to these automated decisions
You always have the right to object to an automated decision with legal consequences or decisions which can otherwise significantly affect you (together with the relevant profiling) by sending an e-mail message to
privacy@klarna.co.uk
. A Klarna employee will then review the decision, taking into account any additional information and circumstances that you provide to us.
7. Who do we share your personal data with?

Those agreements include all reasonable contractual, legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure that your information is processed with an adequate level of protection and in accordance with applicable law.
7.1 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna will always share your personal information, regardless of the service you use.

section 2
for more information about your rights.

Purpose and legal basis
: Personal data is shared with the authority when we are required by law to do so, or in some cases if you have asked us to do so, or if required to manage tax deductions or counter crime. An example of a legal obligation to provide information is when it is necessary to take measures against money laundering and terrorist financing. Depending on the authority and purpose, the legal bases are the obligation to comply with the law (Article 6(1)(c) UK GDPR), to fulfil the agreement with you (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR), or Klarna’s legitimate interest in protecting itself from crime (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR).
There is also a requirement under UK law to withhold tax due on the payments.

Purpose and legal basis
: Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to perform these transactions (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR).

The store’s privacy notice applies to the processing of your personal data that has been shared with the store and that the store processes. Normally, you will find a link to the store’s privacy notice on the store’s website. The legal basis for sharing data with stores is partly the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR) insofar as the data sharing takes place to perform the contract between you and the store, and partly based on Klarna’s and the store’s legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR) or your consent (Article 6(1)(a) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose.

This sharing takes place in accordance with the stores’ or the checkout providers’ own privacy notices. The store may also let Klarna share your information with the payment service provider they use for processing your payment.

7.3 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna shares your data when you use one of Klarna’s payment methods involving the provision of credit or when you use the Klarna card, pay with Instore, pay with Klarna through digital wallets, or the One-time Card Shopping Service.
7.3.1 Credit information bureaus.
Description of the recipient:
If you apply to use a service from Klarna that involves us providing credit (see section 4.3 on which services from Klarna involve credit), we will share your personal data with credit information bureaus. Sharing does not take place in the event of small amounts or where we already have sufficient information.
Purpose and legal basis:
Your personal information is shared with credit bureaus in order to assess your creditworthiness, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud. This data sharing constitutes a credit report.
If you apply to use a credit Service (see Section 4.1 above for a specification of our credit Services), your personal data may be shared with Credit Reference Agencies (“CRAs”) to assess your creditworthiness in connection with your application, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud.
For Klarna card, Pay Later in 30 days or Pay in 3 instalments, this sharing constitutes
soft credit searches
(or “soft credit lookups”) which does not affect your credit file nor credit score. The search is only visible to you and Klarna. In order to perform these credit searches, Klarna will send the CRAs your name, address, date of birth, phone number, as well as bank account number and sort code if relevant, in order to receive the lookups on you.
However, if you apply for one of our Financing products (fixed term loans or revolving account),
a hard credit search
(or “a hard credit lookup”) is performed in addition to soft searches. This is due to our Financing products constituting regulated credit products under UK credit legislation. This hard credit search will be recorded on your credit file and may impact your credit score as follows:
The CRA will keep a record of our enquiry against your name and which may be linked to your representatives (“associated records”). For the purposes of any application for Services from us, you may be assessed with reference to “associated records”. Where any search or application is completed, or agreement entered into, involving joint parties, we may record details about this at the CRAs. As a result an “association” will be created that will link your financial records.
Details of which CRA we have used for a specific search are available on request.
In addition, if you open an agreement with one of our Financing products, Klarna Card, Pay Later in 30 Days or Pay in 3 instalments, we will share further information on your agreement with the CRAs. This will occur on a monthly basis until the agreement is closed. This will include details of your outstanding balance, payments made and any default or failure to meet the terms of your agreement. These records will remain on the CRAs’ files for 6 years after our agreement with you is settled or terminated, whether settled by you or, if applicable, your business or by way of default. This and other information about you (or, if applicable, your business and those with whom you are linked financially) may be used to make credit decisions about you in the future.
The ways in which CRAs use and share personal data are explained in more detail at;
https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain
and
https://www.experian.co.uk/crain
. The CRAs will process your information in accordance with their own privacy notices and you can find out which ones we cooperate with

8. When can we transfer your personal data outside of the UK and the EEA, and how do we protect it then?
We always strive to process your personal data within the UK or EEA area. But in certain situations, such as when we share your information within the Klarna Group or with a supplier, subcontractor or store which operates outside the UK/EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the UK/EEA. Klarna always ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data according to the UK GDPR, even when the data is transferred outside of the UK/EEA. Your rights in respect to your personal data (described in detail in
section 2
), are not affected when data is transferred outside of the UK/EEA. More information about the recipients Klarna shares your data with you can find in
section 7
.
When you shop with a store placed in a country outside of the UK/EEA area, our sharing of your personal data with that store means that your personal data will be transferred to this country outside of the UK/EEA area.
Certain suppliers of Klarna use Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”) when they transfer personal data outside of the UK/EEA area within their own company group. Such BCR have been approved by an EU or UK data protection authority and ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data when it is transferred.
If you want more information about our safety measures you can always contact us. You can find our contact information in
section 12
. You find more information about which countries are deemed to have an “adequate level of protection” on the
European Commission’s website
, and you can read more about the European Commission’s standard clauses
here
, and about binding corporate rules (“BCR”)
here
. The Information Commissioner's Office has information about data transfers
here
.
Safety measures which Klarna uses when transferring personal data outside of the UK/EEA
Countries outside of the UK/EEA may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the UK GDPR). Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring:
if the European Commission or UK authority has decided that the country outside of the UK/EEA to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the UK GDPR. This means for example that the personal data is still protected from unauthorized disclosure, and that you may still exercise your rights in regards to your personal data, or
the European Commission’s standard clauses (with required UK addendums) have been entered into between Klarna and the recipient of the personal data outside the UK/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the UK GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country outside the UK/EEA, or
that the transfer is covered by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, with the UK extension. This is an opt-in certification scheme for US companies, administered by the US Department of Commerce. This Privacy Framework includes a set of enforceable principles and requirements that must be certified to by the US company, ensuring that your data is still being sufficiently protected.
Despite the above, if the store where you choose to shop is located in a country outside the UK/EEA, our data sharing with that store (and with the Klarna entity that store has contracted with) means that your personal data will be transferred to and processed in this country outside the UK/EEA. Click
here
to access the privacy notices for other Klarna entities in the Klarna Group. Otherwise it would not be possible to administer your purchase. Klarna primarily relies on the European Commission’s standard clauses (with required UK addendums) to ensure the protection of your personal data for such data transfers, but as set out above, countries where the foreign store is located may have laws preventing the efficient protection by the standard clauses. Even if this is the case, your personal data will still be transferred to the foreign store (or the foreign store’s local Klarna entity), as long as the data transfer is necessary to administer your specific purchase.
9. How long we store your personal data
How long Klarna stores your personal data depends on the purposes for which Klarna uses the personal data:
Personal data used for the contractual relationship between you and Klarna is generally stored for the duration of the contractual relationship and thereafter for a maximum of up to 10 years based on statutes of limitations rules.
Personal data that Klarna is under a legal obligation to retain, for example under anti-money laundering laws or bookkeeping laws, is generally retained for 5 and 7 years respectively.
We process the recordings of telephone conversations for a time period of 90 days for quality assurance purposes. We will also retain recordings of inbound and outbound calls for up to three years, as well as Klarna employees’ notations from these calls for up to six years, in order to document what has been discussed and decided on the call.
Personal data which is not used for the purposes of your contractual relationship with Klarna or where Klarna does not have a legal obligation to retain the data is only retained as long as necessary to fulfil the respective purpose for our data processing (usually 3 months). More information can be found in the table in
section 4
.
In some limited cases, the personal data may need to be stored for a longer period because of capital adequacy laws which Klarna has to comply with.
The legal obligations referred to above means that Klarna cannot delete your personal data, even if you request us to delete it, as described in
section 2
. If we don’t have a legal obligation to retain the personal data, we instead have to make an assessment if we may require the personal data in order to protect Klarna from legal claims.
Please note that just because we have a legal obligation to store your personal data, this does not mean that we are also permitted to use this data for any other purpose. Klarna will make an assessment for each specific purpose of how long we may use your personal data. You can read more about this in
section 4
.
10. How we use cookies and other types of tracking technology
To provide a tailored and smoooth experience, Klarna uses cookies and similar tracking technologies in our multiple interfaces, such as our website, the Klarna mobile application and at the checkout of a store that uses Klarna. You can find information about the tracking technology that Klarna uses, and information about how you accept or decline the tracking technology, in each interface.
11. Updates to this Privacy Notice
We are constantly working to improve our services so that you have a smoooth user experience. This may involve modifications of existing and future services. If that improvement requires a notice or consent in accordance with applicable law, you will be notified or given the opportunity to give your consent. It is also important that you read this privacy notice every time you use any of our services, as the processing of your personal data may differ from your previous use of the service in question.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, capitalized terms in this Notice have the same meaning as defined in the
Privacy Notice
.
Scope of Notice
This Cookie Notice supplements the information contained in the
Privacy Notice
by explaining how we and our business partners and services providers use cookies, pixel tags and related technologies in the course of managing and providing our online services and our communications to you. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
In some cases, we may use cookies and related technologies described in this Cookie Notice to collect personal information, or to collect information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. For more details about how we process your personal information, please review the
Privacy Notice
.
What Are Cookies and Related Technologies
Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer that allow us and our third-party partners and providers to collect certain information about your interactions with our email communications, websites and other online services.  We and our third-party partners and providers may also use other, related technologies to collect this information, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “
cookies
”).
What We Collect When Using Cookies
We and our third-party providers and partners may use cookies to automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or interact with our email communications, websites and other online services, including the personal information identified in the
Our Collection of Personal Information
section of our
Privacy Notice
.  For example, we may collect log data about your device and its software, such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, date/time of your visit, and other similar information.  We may also collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure usage and activity trends for our online services and better understand our customer/member base.
Our third-party providers and partners may also directly collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our websites and online services.
How We Use That Information
We may use the data collected through cookies to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit our websites and other online services; (b) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our websites and other online services; (c) monitor online usage and activities of our websites and other online services; (d) diagnose errors and problems with our websites and other online services; (e) otherwise plan for and enhance our websites and other online services; and (f) facilitate the other purposes identified in the
Our Use of Personal Information
section of our

Please note that we link some of the personal information we collect through cookies with the other personal information that we collect about you and for the purposes described in the
Our Collection of Personal Information
and
Our Use of Personal Information
sections of our
Privacy Notice

Your Choices About Cookies
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.  Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using our websites and other online services, as some features and offerings may not work properly.  Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.  In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use.  You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.
Some Web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Because each browser communicates “Do Not Track” signals differently, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals at this time.
Many of our websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). For more information on the use of Google Analytics, please visit Google’s privacy policy
here
. You can also view Google’s currently available opt-out options
here

http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/

http://youradchoices.com/appchoices
and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.
Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services.  It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.

Introduction
In our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use information about you, our
merchants using Shopify
to power your business
customers
who shop at a Shopify-powered business
partners
who develop apps for merchants to use, build stores on behalf of merchants, refer potential entrepreneurs to Shopify, or otherwise help merchants operate or improve their Shopify-powered business
users of Shopify apps
and services like
Shop
or
Shop Pay
visitors to
Shopify’s websites
, or anyone contacting
Shopify support
This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the Shopify admin or by email).
Our values
Trust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy.
Your information belongs to you
We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit.
We protect your information from others
If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.
We help merchants and partners meet their privacy obligations
Many of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way. We also provide detailed FAQs and documentation covering the most important privacy topics, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive.
Why we process your information
We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:
preventing risk and fraud
answering questions or providing other types of support
helping merchants find and use apps through our app store
providing and improving our products and services
providing reporting and analytics
testing out features or additional services
assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications
We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.
We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, to understand our purposes for processing, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data.
Your rights over your information
We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use Shopify, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information. We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights. Please note that a number of these rights apply only in certain circumstances, and all of these rights may be limited by law.
If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase or interaction, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with. We are a processor and process information on their behalf. We will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests to the extent required by law, such as by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions.
If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with, please submit your data subject request through our
online portal
. Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents. Further information about rights available to US residents can be found below under the header “United States Regional Privacy Notice”.
If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. If you are located in the EEA or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.
Finally, because there is no common understanding about what a
“Do Not Track”
signal is supposed to mean, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way.
Where we send your information
We are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it. We take steps to protect your information when we send your information across borders.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant.
Transfers outside of Europe and Switzerland
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd. Your information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States. When we send your personal information outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found adequately protects your information. If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our
Subprocessors
), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in the
Standard Contractual Clauses.
Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order). For information about how we respond to such orders, please review our
Guidelines for Legal Requests
.
How long do we retain your information
We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies. If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us, we will delete your information or store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, for further details on the retention of your personal information.
Our use of Machine Learning
One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like “machine learning” (some laws, including certain EEA and UK laws, may refer to this as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have legal or similarly significant effects (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).
How we protect your information
Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You can find more information about our security measures at
/ie/security
.
How we use “cookies” and other tracking technologies
We use
cookies
and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our services. For more information about how we use these technologies, including a list of other companies that place cookies on our sites, a list of cookies that we place when we power a merchant’s store, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
How you can reach us

Why we collect and share your Personal Information
We use and share your personal information for the purposes set out in the Shopify Privacy Policies. For categories of sensitive personal information that we collect, we only use or disclose such information either with your specific consent when required, or as otherwise permitted by law.
Sources of Personal Information
To make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use personal information provided by:
You: We collect the information you provide when you use our platform, including when you sign up for Shopify as a merchant, visit a Shopify-powered store, fill in order information, visit one of Shopify’s websites or contact Shopify support. We collect account and payment information you provide to us (including information about your business if you are a merchant), Shopify stores or items you save to favorites, purchases you make, reviews you post, and how you otherwise interact or communicate with stores or other users on our apps or services. We also collect information about how you browse through our apps and sites, including search terms you may enter.
Your device(s): We collect information from and about the devices you use, including computers, phones, and other web-connected devices you use to access our apps or services, and we combine this information across different devices you use.
Third parties: We receive information from partners who help us provide you with our services including the following:
Email providers. If you use the Shop App and you connect your third party inboxes, such as Gmail or Outlook (according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law), we receive information to identify shopping-related emails and display within Shop information about specific orders you have made, stores you have engaged with in the past, and other related information.
Service Providers. We receive information from our service providers, who help us provide services to our merchants, like reviewing accounts for fraud or other concerns.
Marketplaces. If you use the Shop App, we receive information about purchases you have made from other marketplaces or platforms, such as Amazon, that you choose to connect through Shop. This information helps us to provide and improve Shop, to personalize your experience using our apps and services, and to determine if you are eligible for specific offers or payment methods.
Subprocessors. We work with third party subprocessors for cloud hosting, content delivery, data analysis, internal logging, fulfillment services and email transmission, among others, to provide you with our services. For more information, see Shopify’s subprocessors.
Analytics and cookie providers. We receive information through our use of cookies, social plugins (such as the Facebook “like” button), pixels and tags for business purposes, such as providing information to help measure how users interact with our website content. For more information about how we use these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.
How long we keep your information
Because we need your personal information to provide Shopify services, we generally keep your personal information, including sensitive personal information, while you use Shopify products or services or until you tell us to delete your information. We may also keep personal information to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests.
If you are a merchant operating a Shopify-powered store, and you close the store, stop paying your subscription fees, or we terminate your account, we retain store information for two years before we begin the deletion process.
When you visit or make a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, we act as a service provider or processor for the merchant, and the merchant, not Shopify, decides how long your information is retained.
Your rights over your information
Depending on where you live, how you use Shopify, and subject to certain exceptions, you may have some or all of the following rights:
Right to Know: The right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect, use, or disclose about you, and information about our data practices.
Right to Request Correction: The right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.
Right to Request Deletion: The right to request that we delete personal information that we have collected about you.
To exercise your rights, including the “right to know” and “right to delete,” please submit a request through our online portal. If you use Shop or Shop Pay, please visit
https://shop.app/delete-account
for instructions on how to request deletion of your information.
If you have visited or made a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, please contact the specific merchant directly. If you make a request to us, we will forward your request to the relevant merchant.
Please note that to protect your information and the integrity of our products and services, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In some cases we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as your email address or a government issued ID.
Under US Privacy Laws, you may also designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may need to collect additional information, such as a government issued ID, to verify your identity before processing your request to protect your information.
For information on the CCPA requests we have received, please see here. In certain states, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to these rights. If you wish to appeal a decision, please contact Shopify Support.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
