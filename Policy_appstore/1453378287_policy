Legal basis for using your information
Under data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In the case of Road User Charging, there are a number of these 'legal grounds' we rely on, which are:
Our statutory and public functions:
to undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor's Transport Strategy;
TfL has specific statutory powers to operate the various Road User Charging schemes in London which include administering the various daily charges as well as the issue and enforcement of Penalty Charge Notices;
TfL's use of ANPR cameras for the operation and enforcement of Road User Charging Schemes is also recognised under various statutory regulations.
For the 'performance of a contract':
for example, where you have opened an account to register for a discount, use the Auto Pay service; or apply to the scrappage scheme or
you have downloaded the app so we can provide additional services to you
Where you have given your consent to TfL:
for example where you have opted in to receive marketing messages from us or asked the contact centre to resolve an issue or complaint for you.
How we use your personal information
Roadside cameras
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras operate 24 hours a day. They capture information whenever a vehicle travels within the Road User Charging zone. This includes an alpha-numeric 'read' of a Vehicle Registration Mark (VRM) and photographic (still) images of a vehicle.
Our IT system checks whether the appropriate road user charge is applicable and has been paid for that particular vehicle, or if it is eligible for a discount or exemption.
Once we have verified that no charge is applicable or the appropriate charge has been paid or a discount/exemption applies, the images are deleted. Please see our section on Police access to ANPR cameras further down this page for information on how the police use ANPR data and vehicle images.
If the charge remains unpaid, TfL will retain the VRM for enforcement purposes. We also retain photographic images from one location where the vehicle was seen, to prove entry into the relevant charging area and record the date and time your vehicle was seen. In the case of vehicles registered to an autopay service, VRMs and images are retained for the purposes of statement generation and account settlement.
Images of traffic contraventions are captured by operators using CCTV cameras, rather than ANPR.
RUC accounts
You will need to register with us and create an account if you wish to:
Benefit from Auto Pay
Apply for a RUC discount
Apply for one of the vehicle scrappage schemes
You also need to register if you have a vehicle that is not listed by us as meeting LEZ or ULEZ emissions standards, but you can provide evidence that it does.
As a registered customer, we may also send you travel related information about Road User Charging schemes operating in London. This could include information about proposed changes to our road user charging schemes, updates on the level of charges or hours of operation, or changes to terms and conditions. We might also contact you about major events that could affect drivers, such as road closures and diversions.
You will be able to unsubscribe from any or all of these messages at any time.
We will only send you information about TfL's offers and promotions if you choose to receive it. You will be able to change your marketing preferences at any time.
We will not pass your personal information on to any other organisation for marketing purposes without your prior consent. In addition we do not sell or rent personal data to third parties for this purpose.
If you have authorised one or more additional users to be added to your online Road User Charging account, please be aware that they will have access to all information stored within the account, including details of vehicles, discounts, monthly statements and web chat transcripts.
Paying a daily charge
You don't need to be a registered customer to pay a daily charge for one of the RUC schemes. You can pay online and by phone without registering. If you pay this way, the only information we need is your payment card details and the VRM of the vehicle you're paying for.
You can choose whether to provide an email address or mobile phone number so we can send you a receipt. Once we have verified that the charge has been paid the images of the vehicle that has been paid for are deleted.
Enforcement - UK registered vehicles
If a vehicle is registered in the UK, and an applicable charge has not been paid, TfL will obtain the details of the registered keeper from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and then issue a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN).
If you fail to pay your PCN (or your auto pay account balance), we may apply to the Traffic Enforcement Centre at Northampton County Court to register the money owed as a debt, which allows us to take further steps to recover it. In order to do this we will share details of your PCN and other relevant information with them. We will send you a copy of the information at the same time.
If your PCN or auto pay balance continues to be unpaid, we may pass the unpaid debt to an enforcement agent to collect the money owed on TfL's behalf. As part of their activities, the enforcement agents may undertake certain checks to establish how likely it is they will be able to recover the debt from you. These are also known as 'propensity to pay' checks. They involve the enforcement agents matching/checking the data of the registered keeper of the vehicle (who is liable to pay the PCN) with external data sources, including address and phone number databases, social media activity and email addresses. The enforcement agency will retain its own records in respect of recovering the debt and the actions it has taken.
In cases where we have issued a PCN in relation to a hire vehicle, we may receive information from the hire company that demonstrates you were in possession of the vehicle on the date the contravention occurred, and are therefore liable to pay the PCN.
If you appeal against a PCN issued by TfL to the Environment and Traffic Adjudicators, or to the Road User Charging Adjudicators we will send them relevant information so that they can make their adjudication. We will send you a copy of this appeal pack at the same time.
TfL randomly selects and monitors vehicles benefitting from a road user charging discount or exemption, to identify possible fraud. If you persistently fail to pay any road user charges due or attempt to defraud TfL, we may record your vehicle's movements and use that data to support subsequent enforcement action.
If you hold a TfL Private Hire licence and you persistently fail to pay Penalty Charge Notices related to a private hire vehicle, we may share and validate the vehicle number plate, PCN and name and address details with the records that TfL's Taxi and Private hire department holds for you. This is for the purpose of enforcing our Road User Charging schemes, collecting unpaid PCN monies owed to us and to ensure your ongoing fitness to hold a private hire licence.
Address Tracing trial
From November 2024 we are undertaking a trial related to the way we issue PCNs to UK registered vehicles. In the event we do not receive a response to a PCN within 28 days (ie a payment or a representation), we may undertake further searches to ensure that we hold the correct address information for the registered keeper.
This involves using a 'Trace' service, provided by our existing supplier of back office services for road user charging. The Trace service checks other verifiable sources of address data alongside the DVLA database of registered keepers used to issue the initial PCN. These sources include credit reference agencies, the Electoral Roll, utilities and mobile phone providers, the BT Directory database (OSIS) and the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF).  Where we find more up-to-date address information for the registered keeper, (and after taking steps to check its accuracy) we may reissue the PCN to that new address. These searches are for address information only and do not leave a 'footprint' on any external records or databases and do not affect your credit worthiness or credit rating in any way.
Enforcement - overseas registered vehicles
If a vehicle becomes liable for a PCN and is registered overseas, we will obtain details of the registered keeper from the relevant official national or regional Vehicle Licensing Authority (VLA). This process is undertaken on TfL's behalf by our service provider, Euro Parking Collections Ltd (EPC), who retrieve the registered keeper name and address directly from the relevant national VLA and issue the PCN.
Data relating to overseas registered vehicles obtained by EPC for the purpose of enforcing our Road User Charging schemes is not used by EPC for any other purpose.
Please note that in the case of enforcing the ULEZ, we currently hold limited information about overseas vehicles in our database of compliant vehicles, which is also used for our
online vehicle checker
. Overseas drivers intending to use their vehicle in London should first use the
online vehicle checker
to see if we hold details about its emissions compliance status, and then, if necessary,
register their vehicle
before they travel. This will help to avoid receiving a ULEZ PCN for a vehicle that meets the emissions standards.
Traffic monitoring
We also use our ANPR cameras and the VRMs captured for traffic monitoring and research.
This includes:
Analysing the types of vehicles on London's roads
Analysing numbers of vehicles on London's roads
Measuring levels of vehicle compliance with emissions standards
Measuring average journey times to assess levels of congestion on key routes
Monitoring the impact of specific roadworks on journey times
When doing this, we replace the VRM with an alternative set of letters and numbers. This is called 'pseudonymisation' and is a way of distinguishing vehicles in a dataset by using a unique identifier that does not reveal its 'real world' identity. This is a way of protecting people's privacy in line with the
Information Commissioner's Anonymisation Code of Practice
.
Length of time we keep information
Details of each charge payment: 24 months from the date of the transaction (regardless of whether or not you are a registered customer)
Vehicle images are automatically deleted a maximum of 30 days after payment of the charge has been received and verified or when we have verified that your vehicle is registered for a discount or exemption, or it is otherwise compliant with scheme requirements (eg your vehicle is known to meet the ULEZ emission standards).
For Autopay customers, ANPR data and images are retained until after the account has been settled, usually a maximum period of 120 days
Details of a discount are retained for 24 months after the date the discount expires
Details of a PCN are retained for seven years after you paid the PCN (this will include images of the vehicle you were driving)
Details of a successful scrappage scheme application are retained for up to 10 years (in line with State Aid rules). Unsuccessful applications are retained for 2 years
Recordings of telephone calls made to our Road User Charging contact centre are retained for 90 days from the date of the call
Web chat transcripts are retained for 90 days from the date the online chat took place
We retain your personal information for these time periods for the following reasons:
To respond to correspondence, concerns or complaints
To maintain records according to rules that apply to us (for example financial regulations)
To establish and defend any legal rights
Keeping personal information secure
We take the privacy of our customers very seriously, and a range of robust policies, processes and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, personal information associated with Road User Charging schemes. This includes payment card data which is handled in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ('PCI DSS').
Find out how to
protect your personal information
.
Automated processing and profiling
Under data protection legislation we have to let you know when we do something 'automatically' using our computers or other systems, or make an automated decision (without human intervention) that significantly affects you.
When you drive within the Congestion Charge Zone, Ultra Low Emission Zone or Low Emission Zone, your vehicle's VRM is automatically captured by the road side cameras as described above.
The level and type of charge is automatically determined using details of the vehicle, as provided by the relevant vehicle licensing agency and/or by the customer.
Details of the registered keeper are also automatically retrieved from the DVLA (or overseas licensing agency) so that a PCN can be issued.
Before any PCN is processed, the details captured by the camera are manually checked by an individual. This check requires the operator to validate the VRM being used for the PCN against the vehicle images captured by the camera and cross referencing against the vehicle make, model and colour details. Each potential PCN is also checked by a second individual. If the two individuals do not agree then the case is escalated to a supervisor for a final decision.
Sharing your information
TfL has contracts with a number of third party service providers, which provide the majority of the administration and 'back office' services that ensure the efficient day-to-day operation of the Road User Charging schemes and the scrappage scheme. This includes the customer database, the installation and maintenance of the cameras, the secure IT connection to the DVLA and debt recovery services within the UK and overseas.
Different departments within TfL share information to help ensure compliance with our Road User Charging schemes - as well to monitor the effectiveness of the different schemes.
This includes details of vehicles and drivers licensed for private hire by TfL which may have accrued unpaid PCNs. This helps us ensure we have the correct address details for the registered keeper. Unpaid PCNs may also be a breach of private hire licensing conditions.
As well as our own 'in house' traffic monitoring, we sometimes work with external research companies. We ensure that research is carried out in accordance with privacy and data protection legislation and is protected by robust confidentiality agreements.
If you have a query about your account, a service for which you have registered, or a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) you have received and would like a third party to contact us on your behalf, we will generally only deal with them with your written permission or if you have authorised them as an additional user on your online Road User Charging account.
If you made an application to one of our vehicle scrappage schemes we may have shared or requested information about you from other local authorities or organisations in order to verify your eligibility to receive a payment.
If you wish to register your vehicle as being compliant with the standards for ULEZ, we may check or verify the emissions standards of your vehicle with the relevant manufacturer on a case by case basis. This may be done by using the Vehicle Registration Mark or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
In addition to the real-time access described below by which the MPS has to TfL's ANPR cameras, we may, at our discretion, disclose personal data in response to valid requests from the police. Before we authorise any disclosure the police have to demonstrate that the personal data concerned will assist them in the prevention or detection of a specific crime, or in the apprehension or prosecution of an offender. Each request from the police is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with data protection legislation. These requests may ask for the disclosure of images captured by our ANPR cameras or for data and images from cameras installed for the expansion of ULEZ in 2021, neither of which form part of the data to which the MPS currently has real-time access (see further below).
Overseas processing
TfL and its service providers process personal information relating to Road User Charging within the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Any such processing will be carried out by TfL and its service providers in accordance with UK privacy legislation and the appropriate contractual safeguards which TfL has put in place.
Some of our testing activities take place by permitting our suppliers to have remote access to specific data used for this purpose from off shore locations. These include Argentina, India and Israel. Any such access is managed in accordance with contractual obligations and UK data protection legislation.
Police access to ANPR cameras
In 2012, one of the then Mayor of London's commitments was to instruct TfL to give the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) direct real time access to the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras we use to enforce our Road User Charging schemes, for the purposes of preventing and detecting crime. Following a public consultation, the MPS was given access to this data in 2015. A
Mayoral Delegation
(MD) was granted to TfL so that we had the powers to provide access. In effect, this means that TfL and the MPS share the vehicle number plate data feed from the network of Road User Charging cameras which TfL operated at that time.
This was an expansion of a pre-existing arrangement with the MPS established in 2007, under which they were given access to TfL's ANPR data specifically for the purpose of using it to safeguard national security. This arrangement was approved by the then Home Secretary, who signed a certificate confirming that TfL, and the MPS, are exempt from certain provisions of data protection legislation for that purpose.
In light of TfL's expansion of the ULEZ to the boundaries of the North and South Circular roads in 2021, TfL entered into discussions with the MPS on granting access to those additional cameras installed for the expansion, for the purpose of preventing and detecting crime. An
updated MD
was signed by the Mayor of London in May 2022 in order to enable this. The Mayoral Delegation also:
Enables the MPS to receive a feed of still photographic images of vehicles captured by the ANPR cameras that the MPS was already receiving the vehicle number plate data feed from (no images were transferred before this MD was issued)
And, in principle, allows future ANPR cameras installed by TfL for specified road user charging schemes to come within scope of the sharing arrangement (subject to the MPS completing appropriate strategic assessments to demonstrate that access to any or all additional cameras is proportionate and necessary, and compliance with data protection, and equalities obligations).
The MPS has completed an initial
Data Protection Impact Assessment
and Equality Impact Assessment and undertaken a number of public engagement activities.
In exceptional circumstances or to ensure the security of high risk events, TfL may also allow MPS access to vehicle image data from specified ANPR cameras, where the MPS is able to demonstrate that there is a need for the purpose of policing such incidents or safeguarding such events.

Mobile app
If you download and use the Road User Charging mobile app, certain information may be collected automatically, such as the type of mobile device you are using and unique identifier such as the device name or ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, and IMEI number.
We also use analytics (which is similar to cookies on websites) which are small files that capture anonymous data to help us improve the app's performance. We use them to collect information about your use of the app, such as what app content you access most frequently, or if you receive an error message when using the app.
If you opt in, we will also send you notifications via the app, or use location services to provide you with relevant information about your use of the scheme. You can change your mind at any time by amending the settings within your device
Testing, research and development
From time to time we may use certain personal data in order to help us test the performance and capacity of our infrastructure, investigate new technologies and to research and develop more accurate or more efficient ways of implementing road user charging and the administrative processes that support it. This, in turn, supports our statutory function to provide efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor's Transport Strategy.
Wherever we can, we will use pseudonymised or 'dummy' data but sometimes, when there is no other alternative, we need to use 'real life' personal data as well as VRMs that have been captured by our network of ANPR cameras. When we undertake such activities, we take great care to ensure that we use the minimum data possible. Data used for a testing, research or development purpose will not be used to take, or inform, decisions affecting individuals.
On some occasions we might have to keep VRM data for a longer period than we would normally for the operation of our road user charging schemes. When that is the case, we will ensure that the data cannot be used for any other purpose other than for testing, research and development and that it is stored securely with restricted access.
We will also ensure that we complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment when we use need to use personal data for research and development purposes and will publish these where possible.

The Ultra Low Emission Zone
On 29 August 2023, the
Ultra Low Emission Zone expanded
across all London boroughs.
The scheme is enforced in the same way as our other road user charging schemes, using a mix of existing and newly installed ANPR cameras in the expanded zone. TfL
road signs
are in place on the boundary of the ULEZ, as well as within the expanded zone, so you will know if you are in an enforcement area.
Mobile ANPR camera vehicles were deployed for a number of months following the launch of the expanded ULEZ in August 2023. Our Data Protection Impact Assessment on the use of these cameras is published below.
TfL has issued body worn cameras to the engineers who install and maintain our ULEZ cameras. These devices are able to capture audio recordings as well as images. The cameras are clearly visible and will be activated by the user in the event of an incident (for example if they are being subjected to verbal abuse or threats of violence). Footage may be shared with the police in the event an incident occurs. Body worn cameras are not used to capture images of vehicles or for any part of the ULEZ enforcement process.
From early May 2023 (before the expanded scheme formally began), the newly installed ANPR cameras were used to test the technical infrastructure that links the camera network to the Road User Charging back office systems and also to ensure that cameras were capturing vehicle data correctly and at the right volumes. We also use the cameras for business planning purposes (eg resourcing and system capacity requirements), traffic monitoring (using pseudonymised data as described above on this page), as well as to inform our awareness campaign for the expanded zone.
Any cameras installed before May 2023 were operational, in order to check they had been installed correctly, but any vehicle data collected was not retained or used for any purpose. From 24 July 2023 we tested mobile ANPR camera vehicles in locations where camera coverage is limited due to installation or camera operational issues.
To ensure our approach to the expansion of the Inner London ULEZ in 2021 properly considered all the privacy and data protection issues, we completed a number of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are published below.
Between May and July 2022, we held a public consultation on the proposal to further expand the ULEZ London-wide and we conducted a draft DPIA to consider the potential privacy issues connected to administering a larger zone. TfL's final
Report to the Mayor
was published in November 2022, together with an updated DPIA which includes revisions based on the responses received to the consultation.

ULEZ expansion awareness campaign
In order to raise awareness ahead of the
London wide expansion of the ULEZ
, we contacted people in several different ways between December 2022 and the launch of the scheme in August 2023.
The nature of this varied depending on whether people were existing Road User Charging customers or the registered keepers of other vehicles that might be affected by the introduction of the scheme. If you wish to know more about this, please contact the Privacy and Data Protection team at
dpo@tfl.gov.uk

TfL's vehicle scrappage schemes
TfL has administered scrappage schemes since 2019, with the most recent ones launched in 2023. All of the scrappage schemes closed to new applicants in September 2024. The aim of the schemes were to support people on certain low income and disability benefits as well as microbusinesses, sole traders and charities to replace vehicles that do not comply with ULEZ emissions standards. When you applied for the scheme, you were required to create a Road User Charging account (if you didn't have one already) and provide information about yourself (or business or charity where applicable) and your vehicle.
As with other aspects of our road user schemes, we are required to have proper legal grounds for handling any personal data that you provided for the relevant scrappage scheme. In this case, the 'legal basis' is that the use of your data was necessary to facilitate the scheme under our public and statutory functions, derived from the Mayor's decision to expand the ULEZ in 2023.
All of the personal information you provided with your application is stored securely. If you supplied information about a third party in any of the applications, we asked you to ensure you had their permission to do so. We retain the information collected for administering the van and minibus scrappage scheme or ULEZ car and motorcycle scrappage scheme, and to support the following purposes:
To handle correspondence, concerns or complaints about the scrappage schemes
To evaluate the schemes and collect feedback via surveys; successful applicants may also be contacted for feedback to be included in publicity material
To maintain records according to rules that apply to us (for example financial regulations)
To establish and defend any legal rights
Fraud detection and prevention
To monitor the effectiveness of the scheme
Where your application was processed as part of the 2019 scheme and a grant payment awarded to you as a sole trader, small business or charity, your data such as account correspondence and payment details will be retained for a period of 10 years in accordance with State Aid rules. Otherwise, where no payment was awarded or you applied as an individual, your data will be retained for up to 7 years.
Any data submitted as part of your application for the 2023 scheme will be retained for up to 7 years if successful, and 2 years if your application was rejected.
We will share your information with our trusted service providers who administer the schemes on behalf of TfL, by processing your applications, issuing travel passes (where applicable) and securely storing your data. The type of information you provided and how we handled it varies depending on which scheme you apply for.
If you choose to donate your vehicle to Ukraine instead of scrapping it, you will be referred to British-Ukrainian Aid ('BUA'), a registered charity, who will independently process your data to enable the transfer of your vehicle. So that we can issue the grant payment to you, BUA will provide us with information about successful applicants as well as the Certificates of Donations including the vehicle's VRM and your account reference number.
The ULEZ van and minibus scrappage scheme
We collected various information about your vehicle and your organisation to verify eligibility for the scheme under the terms and conditions. This included a copy of V5c registration document, insurance certificate, evidence of organisation status (i.e. company's house/ charity/ VAT number, sole trader evidence), photo ID of the director of a microbusiness, trustee of a charity and sole trader and where different registered keeper of the vehicle (i.e. the director, sole trader, employee or one of the trustees), and certificate of (vehicle) destruction. Applicants retrofitting their vehicle under the scheme were required to provide a CVRAS retrofit certificate and invoice. We also requested details of minimal financial assistance where you have received any subsidy control in the last 3 financial years.
As part of meeting the eligibility criteria for the 2019 Scheme, some applicants were required to confirm they had driven their vehicle within the Central Congestion Charge Zone or Greater London area on a minimum of 26 occasions between in the six months before the Scheme first started (which was 22 February 2019). If you had a Road User Charging Auto Pay account for the Congestion Charge, we used the transaction records to verify this.
We also verified the information you gave about your business, charity or vehicle with a number of third parties including Companies House, the Charity Commission, HMRC, the DVLA and against other public databases made available by the Government Digital Service.
In the event that you do not use the funds issued to you in accordance with the scheme terms and conditions, we have the right to recover those funds, and share information with, or receive information from, other organisations in order to do this.
The ULEZ car and motorcycle scrappage scheme
We collected information about you and your vehicle, such as copies of V5c registration documents, insurance certificate, certificate of (vehicle) destruction, photo ID of the applicant and CVRAS retrofit certificate and invoice, if applicable, to prove your eligibility. We also verified the information you gave about your vehicle with the DVLA.
If you applied before 21 August 2023, (or if you were an applicant receiving a disabled benefit applying to scrap your nominated driver's vehicle) as part of meeting the eligibility criteria for the scheme you were asked to provide proof that you were in receipt of one of the state benefits listed in the application process. These documents may have included 'special category' data as defined under UK GDPR. We process this information under the 'substantial public interest' condition, specifically 'statutory and government purposes' found under Schedule 1 paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act 2018. If you submitted proof of entitlement to child benefit, the document included award details containing personal information about your child. We securely retain this information as supporting evidence for your application. We appreciate this kind of information is particularly sensitive and reassure you that it is not used by TfL for any other purpose at any time, nor shared with any third parties.
Within the application, you were asked to confirm whether you are a paid care worker. This information did not affect your eligibility for the scheme, as we only used this information for monitoring purposes and to contact care workers about future opportunities if they become available.
If the registered keeper of the vehicle lives with the applicant or is the applicant's nominated driver, the applicant submitted the required information on their behalf. As part of this scheme in 2023, you had an option to apply for an Annual Bus & Tram Pass for yourself and a beneficiary living at the same address. To issue this pass to you, we required your and your beneficiary's photo ID, contact information as well as proof of address. As part of this process, a record for you and your beneficiary was created in our back office system, which will be linked to your Oyster card. You will be asked to set up an online account using the same email address, and your records will be accessible via that account. This information will be processed in accordance with our
TfL Oyster card privacy policy
.
ULEZ Grace Period
To aid the transition to an expanded ULEZ, TfL has introduced new grace periods (temporary exemptions) for certain groups. Successful applicants will not need to pay the daily charge to drive a vehicle inside the ULEZ that does not meet the emission standards until their grace period expires. You can find more information about the grace periods on our
Discounts and exemptions page
.
When you submit your application, we will collect your personal information to process your application and confirm your eligibility. This involves sharing or receiving data from the DVLA for verification purposes. The collected data will be used for administering the ULEZ grace period.
The data you submit as part of this application are processed in accordance with our statutory and public functions under the Mayor's decision to expand the ULEZ in 2023 and implement the ULEZ grace period to mitigate the financial impact of the expansion.
To process your application, we will collect a range of personal data about yourself and your vehicle. For either of the grace periods, you must create a Road User Charging account (if you don't have one already) and provide information about yourself such as your name, address, email and telephone number. We also ask for the VRM, V5c and a photo ID of the applicant, and in the case of the wheelchair accessible vehicles grace period, images of the vehicle.
When applying for the Disabled benefits grace period, we collect additional information from you. This includes a benefit award letter, and, if you have a nominated driver, we will also require information from them as the registered vehicle keeper. As part of meeting the eligibility criteria, you may have to provide information about your health or disability. We process this information based on substantial public interest under the Data Protection Act 2018. Please be assured that TfL will not use this information for any other purpose at any time.
We will retain the data you submit for up to 7 years. We will use your personal data for fraud prevention as well as monitoring effectiveness of the scheme, and we may also use some information for research purposes. In certain circumstances, TfL may also share your personal information with the police and other law enforcement agencies for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime.
Your information rights
Under data protection legislation you are entitled to ask to see any personal information that we hold about you.
If you are a registered customer, you can access and update your personal information by signing into your online account.
For access to other personal information held by TfL in connection with Road User Charging or the scrappage scheme, please see our page on how to

You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors
528
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors
762
Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Vendors

Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Vendors
571
Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

Privacy & cookies
We are committed to protecting your personal information when you use TfL services. In this section we explain how we ensure that your privacy is respected and protected.
If you need to contact the Privacy team or submit a request, please use the relevant form on our
Access Your Data
page or email
DPO@tfl.gov.uk
. There can sometimes be delays in receiving post.
Who we are and what we do
We sometimes need to collect your personal information so that we can provide you with the full range of our services, operate London's transport network effectively and carry out our statutory functions. Here, we outline our obligations and your rights under the data protection legislation, which regulates the use of personal information by all private and public sector organisations.
TfL is a statutory body created by the Greater London Authority (GLA) Act 1999. The GLA Act gives the Mayor of London a general duty to develop and apply policies to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within London. This is known as the 'General Transport Duty'. The Mayor delegates this duty to TfL to carry out on their behalf, together with the implementation of the Mayor's Transport Strategy.
Why we handle personal information
Under data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In most cases, our handling of your personal information will be necessary for the delivery of the Mayor's Transport Strategy and the statutory functions described above.
Depending on the TfL product or service you use or sign up for, there may be another legal basis that makes the handling of your personal information lawful. You should refer to the menu of privacy pages on this page for more information.

TfL services
If you are asked to provide information when applying for, or using, specific TfL services (eg the Zip Oyster photocard or Santander Cycles schemes) these pages outline how we use and protect this information.
Service messages and marketing
If you are currently receiving service messages or marketing communications from TfL and no longer wish to do so, please let us know by emailing
unsubscribe@tfl.gov.uk
.
If you are receiving marketing emails as a business contact, we rely on the 'legitimate interests' processing condition to contact you based on our previous engagement, or consent if you have signed up via our registration form. If you would like to unsubscribe from these messages, please email
CommercialMediaandPartnerships@tfl.gov.uk
.
Please note on some occasions there are some service messages that we are obliged to send, regardless of your contact preferences. For example, these include emails regarding purchases or other financial transactions you've made and important account updates where you have created an online account or downloaded an app.
Sharing personal information
We do not sell your personal information to anyone. We don't share your personal information with any third parties unless they are providing services to us under contract or disclosure is permitted by, or required by, law. Please refer to the menu of privacy pages on this page for more information.
Third-party sites
Our website contains links to sites owned and operated by third parties. They have their own privacy policies, and we urge you to review them before browsing those sites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third-party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.
Protecting your personal information
Your privacy is very important to TfL, and we take all necessary measures to ensure your personal information is properly protected and secured. This includes having appropriate technical and organisational arrangements to secure your information. TfL will never send an unsolicited message asking you to provide your password, financial details or other sensitive information by email or through a link.
Current and recent projects
Google Street View
TfL worked with Google to deliver Street View in Stations, which launched in December 2024. This provides TfL customers with additional journey planning support. More detail on this work, and its launch in Street View, can be found in the latest
press release
.
From November 2023 until September 2024, Google filmed at over thirty TfL stations. TfL customers were informed in advance, and on the day of filming, that filming would be taking place. During filming, images of TfL customers were captured by Google cameras as they photographed each station. Google used its blurring technology on the imagery, which is designed to automatically blur identifiable faces before publication of images on Google's Street View. Google has a process where additional blurring can be requested by users, or members of the public.
Google is the data controller and is therefore responsible for the collection of the images when filming, and the blurring of identifiable faces before footage is made public. However, our decision to allow Google to film on the network was subject to a data protection impact assessment.

The TfL Privacy and Data Protection team considers and coordinates responses to requests and complaints from people whose personal data is processed by TfL and its subsidiary companies. If you have any requests and complaints relating to the footage that Google collected during their filming please contact Google directly. For more information visit

E-scooter trial
TfL are currently working with London Councils and some London boroughs to deliver a rental e-scooter trial for London. The trial began on 7 June 2021 and was originally set to run for at least 12 months, with three e-scooter operators taking part. The trial has subsequently been extended and will now run until May 2026, with two e-scooter operators taking part. More details can be found on the
Electric scooter rental trial
.
Operators are sharing data with us throughout the trial period. This includes data relating to the location of vehicles, trips taken, user and usage information (including surveys), safety and incident reporting, environment and sustainability metrics, and education and outreach activities. Information shared with us is used to ensure we can safely manage the trial, and support research, monitoring and evaluation.
Some of the data shared with TfL will have originally been provided by e-scooter hirers during their use of an operator's services and when responding to surveys. To ensure our approach to the collection of this data is appropriate we have carried out privacy assessments and have taken steps to ensure any personal information collected is limited, for example ensuring data is aggregated and depersonalised where possible. TfL will not use any data shared with us to identify specific individuals.
Data collected will also be shared with London Councils and London boroughs, and TfL has a contract with a third-party service provider for the delivery of a data platform to store some of the data.
Under privacy and data protection legislation TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. Our 'legal basis' here is our statutory and public functions to undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor's Transport Strategy.
Data collected will not be held for longer than is necessary for the purposes we have obtained it for.
The TfL Privacy and Data Protection team considers and coordinate responses to requests and complaints from anyone whose personal data is processed by TfL. You can contact the Data Protection Officer by email at

We and our 918 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.
Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest. View our list of partners to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors
528
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors
762
Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Vendors

Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

Changes to this page
If you hold a concessionary Oyster card, please refer to the privacy page which applies to your scheme. If you use your contactless payment card (or other device) to travel please see our
Contactless privacy page
.
If you access your Oyster and contactless online account via our TfL Go app, please also visit our
TfL Go privacy page
.
Personal information we hold
Some of the data listed below is only held if you have registered your Oyster card, for example by adding it to an online account. See the Obtaining and using your personal information section for more detail:
Title, name, address, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number)
Customer ID
Oyster card number
Password/memorable information/security passcode
Mobile device number (unique code used to identify a device where a customer has opted in to receiving notifications via the TfL Oyster and contactless app)
Your marketing and contact preferences
Your journey history
Payment card information (including the 16 digit PAN, expiry date and CVV number) or bank account and sort code numbers
Transaction information (for example when and where you topped up your balance or purchased a season ticket, or were issued with a refund, or set up Auto top-up)
If you access your account through the TfL Go or TfL Oyster and contactless apps, we also capture some information about your device, such as a device identifier, type and details of the operating system and version of the app you are using
Enquiries, complaints or other correspondence from you
Supporting evidence collected in relation to some types of refunds
If you sign in to your online account, we will collect the IP address used by your device for the purpose of fraud prevention and detection.
Legal basis for using your information
Under privacy and data protection legislation, we may only use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In the case of Oyster cards, there are a number of these 'legal grounds' we rely on, which are:
Our statutory and public functions:
to undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor's Transport Strategy
Where you have given us your consent, for example:
where you have opted in to receive marketing messages or in-app notifications from us; or
you have asked our contact centre to resolve an issue or complaint for you
For the 'performance of a contract', for example:
in connection with topping up your pay as you go credit, or a season ticket
where you have created an online account so we can provide additional services to you
For the 'purposes of legitimate interests':
to enable train operators to plan and improve services. Train operators are companies providing National Rail services which accept the use of Oyster and contactless payment cards on their services
to verify your identity when you contact us or log on to your account
to process data for online account security monitoring purposes
Obtaining and using personal information
Using your online account
The personal information we hold is provided by you when you create an online account via our website or one of our apps (TfL Oyster and contactless app or TfL Go app) and register your Oyster card, or use an Oyster card on the TfL network, and on other services on which Oyster cards are accepted. Depending on how you set up an account and attach an Oyster card to it, we will request only necessary information from you. For example, if you create an account via one of our apps for your Oyster card, we do not require a security question and answer, or security passcode. If you add a contactless card to your account, set up the account via our website, or access your app account via our website, this additional information is required.
If you don't have an online account but contact us about your Oyster card (e.g. to arrange a refund, request a new card, transfer a balance from one card to another, etc) a record of this will be created in our back office system. If you set up an online account later some of these records may be accessible via that account. When this record is created we capture your name, address and email address. In some circumstances we may also capture a contact phone number. This information is then linked to your Oyster card, including any current and future journey history held. Any subsequent records made if you contact us again are also linked to your details.
When you contact TfL
If you contact Customer Services, we will need to collect information from you so that we can respond to your query or request. If you phone us we may record your call so we can train staff, review call quality and have access to a verbal record of what has been said in the event of a subsequent complaint. At the end of your contact with us, we may email you to take part in a customer satisfaction survey about your experience with Customer Services. This helps us monitor our performance, improve quality and plan for future services.
We sometimes also undertake analysis or research into the types of subjects that commonly cause customer concerns and complaints. For example we might look for key words or themes and this helps us improve and plan our services for the future. Pseudonymisation, or other appropriate data minimisation techniques are applied so that we can analyse the subject matter without needing to know the identity of the person themselves. This is a way of protecting people's privacy in line with the
Information Commissioner's Anonymisation Code of Practice
.
Contacting you by email
If you sign up for an online account via our website or either of our apps and provide your email address, from time to time we will send you travel related information by email. These service messages contain useful information in relation to the products you have bought or services that you use, and might include:
important changes to services you use
new travel services
travel disruption
information about fares
consultations on TfL's plans for transport in London
changes to terms and conditions of travel
We appreciate that you don't always want to be contacted in this way, so all our emails will include a hyperlink so you can opt out from receiving future service messages at any time.
We will only send you messages about TfL's offers and promotions (marketing messages) if you choose to receive them, and you can change your marketing preferences at any time.
On occasion we may also send you details of surveys for you to participate in. Some of these surveys are based on your use of TfL services (e.g. journey information, services used, frequency of use, etc). These emails will also include a hyperlink so you can opt out of future surveys.
There are some communications that we have to send you to fulfil our contractual obligations to you. These include emails regarding purchases or other financial transactions you've made (such as Auto top-up, pay as you go transactions or processing a refund) and important account updates where you have created an online account or downloaded one of our apps.
We will never pass your personal information to any other organisation for marketing purposes without your prior consent.
Information about the journeys you take
Our ticketing systems record the location, date and time an Oyster card is used to make a journey on TfL's network, affiliated National Rail services or London River services.
Using journey information to plan and improve services
Understanding how our customers use the transport network allows TfL and Train Operating Companies to plan, manage and improve services. The information used for these purposes doesn't contain customers' personal data. We do not combine this data with CCTV or other sources of data that could identify individuals. This type of data is called pseudonymised journey information, and it allows organisations to carry out transport research without identifying individuals.
We use pseudonymised journey information to carry out research and analysis, for example, to look at travel demand, provide customers with information on how busy stations are at particular times and to make improvements to our transport services. This helps us meet our responsibilities under the Greater London Authority Act 1999; including the delivery of the Mayor's Transport Strategy and the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within Greater London. From time to time we may use this information in connection with our other statutory rights and obligations.
We use pseudonymised journey information to undertake intelligence, analysis and research activities to identify and inform responses to a number of safety issues including:
Reducing all crime and anti-social behaviour on and around the public transport network
Creating crime and anti-social behaviour strategies
Targeting crime and disruption hotspots to better coordinate and deploy policing resources
Reducing fear of crime and improving public confidence in the safety of the journeys they make in the capital
Pseudonymised information about journeys made using Oyster cards that have been taken entirely or partly on routes served by National Rail services is provided to National Rail train operating companies for the following purposes:
To set prices with TfL;
To predict future income, set fares and allocate revenue between train operating companies;
To better understand passenger demand for business, leisure and commuting journeys, and predict how this may change in the future;
To understand the scope and extent of flexible travel to inform initiatives to encourage passengers to travel outside of peak periods;
To assess the benefits of proposed investments in infrastructure and to inform strategic long-term railway planning;
To allow other train operating companies to bid to provide services
Pseudonymised information is processed on the basis of legitimate interests of Train Operating Companies and for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or the exercise of TfL's official authority. You have the right to object to use of personal data that is processed on this basis. See the Your information rights section for more detail.
Securing your online account
In 2023 we introduced
multi-factor authentication (MFA)
to strengthen the existing security measures for online accounts. Existing account holders are prompted to set up MFA when they sign in and for new account holders this is completed as part of the registration process. We request a mobile phone number which will be used each time you sign in to receive a text with a unique code to enter in the sign in screen. The phone number provided for MFA will only be used for the purposes of MFA, unless you have previously provided the number to TfL for a separate purpose (e.g. when liaising with Customer Services).
Choosing not to provide personal information
You can use your Oyster card to pay as you go at any time without providing your personal information to TfL. You can also add weekly and monthly season tickets to your Oyster card without needing to register your card or create an online account.
If you choose not to provide personal information to us, you will not be able to open an online account, add a season ticket to your card that is longer than a month or get a refund (for example if your card is lost or stolen). It may also delay or prevent us from offering other services to you such as the resolution of complaints or concerns.
See the Your information rights section for information about your rights, including accessing your information, raising an objection to the way it is used or requesting its deletion.
Length of time we keep information
We will retain personal information in line with our information disposal policies. This means that we will not hold information for longer than is necessary for the purposes we obtained it for.
We usually retain information about the individual journeys made using your Oyster card (including Freedom Passes) for between eight and nine weeks after the card is used. The journey data in the ticketing system is then disassociated from your card during the ninth week (ie pseudonymised). This period is considered reasonable to enable customers to verify or make enquiries concerning their journeys (for example, for refund purposes). As a temporary measure to assist customers, following the cyber incident TfL experienced in September 2024, we will be extending the length of time we keep information about individual journeys made using an Oyster card beyond nine weeks, to support future customer refunds and access to journey history.
In certain limited cases, some information about individual journeys will be held for a longer period of time. An example of this is where we hold data as evidence in relation to TfL's revenue protection function (including the issue of penalty fares and prosecutions for fare evasion).
Some journey information is also stored on the Oyster card itself; this comprises the last eight journeys and related charges, up to three season ticket products, (generally the most recent three tickets, including future dated), and the last two incomplete journeys, if any. If you don't use your Oyster card very often, the data stored on the card may be older than eight weeks.
We hold some summary data relating to journeys made using Freedom Passes which is held for a longer period than the standard retention period described above. This data does not show any individual journeys made on a specific date or time, but it shows the number of journeys taken over a month, and for some cases, the stations travelled from and to during a particular month. This data is kept solely for the purpose of assessing the amount of money individual boroughs pay to TfL for the Freedom Pass scheme, it is not used to make any decisions directly about Freedom Pass holders.
Call recordings made when you contact Customer Services are kept for 6 months.
Keeping personal information secure
We take the privacy of our customers very seriously, and a range of robust policies, processes and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, personal information associated with Oyster data. This includes payment card data which is handled in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ('PCI DSS').
Anyone with access to personal information held in TfL's systems is required to complete TfL's privacy and data protection training on an annual basis.
In 2023 we introduced multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen the existing security measures for online accounts - whether accessed via our website or apps. MFA is an additional layer of security to the account sign in process, helping to confirm you are who you say you are each time you sign into your account. You may be prompted with a subsequent MFA request in certain circumstances.
Alongside the use of MFA, account sign-ins are subjected to automated fraud and security monitoring to identify suspicious activity and further protect accounts and the information within them. This includes monitoring login activity at the point of sign in and over time (e.g. IP address, browser, geographic location determined by IP address, identity information, known compromised credentials, previous login behaviour, etc).
We also publish
guidance
on the steps you can also take to protect your personal information.
Automated processing and profiling
Under data protection legislation we have to let you know when we use your personal information to make an automated decision (without human intervention) that significantly affects you.
If you are a pay as you go customer, we calculate the fares you are charged using automated means - ie using the location where you start your journey (touch in) and, if travelling by train or tube, end your journey (touch out). If you use a pink card reader, that data will be used to confirm you took a particular route and charge you accordingly.
On some occasions, we may 'auto complete' a journey for you if you do not tap your Oyster card on a yellow reader at both ends of your journey. We do this based on other journeys you have made to estimate the likely origin or destination of the incomplete journey.
If you are due a refund as a result of us auto completing your journey (eg if you were originally charged a maximum single fare), we will also automatically load the refund amount to your Oyster card.
We may also automatically issue you a refund if your journey history indicates that you have been affected by a major disruption or an incident that has severely impacted your travel.
If you believe you have been incorrectly charged, or not received a refund you were due, you can ask our Customer Service team to review those transactions.
We analyse journey patterns and transaction history to inform measures to protect against fare evasion and fraudulent transactions. We use this data in different ways. For example, to identify 'hotspots' so we can deploy Revenue Inspectors in certain London Underground stations or on particular bus routes.
We may also use the outcome of our analysis to contact Oyster card holders directly, with advice to touch in and out at the correct stages of a journey. In cases where we suspect fraud, we might invite you to attend a formal interview with us.
We may also suspend Oyster cards based on their initial purchases, subsequent top ups and disable online Oyster accounts based on online activities.
We also use your journey history, travel patterns, or frequently used stations as the basis for sending service and marketing messages. For example if you regularly use the Central Line, we might use this information to help decide that messages about service alterations on that line would be helpful for you to know. We may also use this information to send you relevant surveys from time to time.
Similarly, if you have provided us with your address, we may use postcode information to decide that it would be useful for you to know about changes to travel services near where you live, such as a station or bus stop closure or a road closure or diversions.
The purpose of this type of profiling is to make sure that we send only information to people who will actually find it relevant and useful. You are able to opt out from receiving these kinds of messages at any time.
We have a statutory duty to do all we reasonably can to reduce crime and disorder on and around the transport system - and we work together with our local authority, policing, and other law enforcement partners as part of this. Journey patterns may also be used to inform police deployments to prevent and deter crime on the transport network. We use automated systems to prevent and detect fraud and protect the safety and security of our online services.
We use automated processes to support the security of your account and the information within it - such as presenting MFA requests to authenticate your identity and ongoing monitoring to identify suspicious activity such as fraud. The purpose of this type of profiling is to further protect accounts and the information within them.
If you have any difficulties accessing your account you can contact Customer Services for support.
From February 2025 and for a period of six months, we're trialling the use of an AI-based solution in our contact centre to assess whether it could help us manage and respond to some of the customer correspondence we receive. The tool will be used to review the content and subject matter of an email or webform and suggest an appropriate response. All suggestions generated by the tool will be manually reviewed, and where necessary amended by a contact centre agent before sending a response back to a customer.
Sharing personal information
We have contracts with a number of service providers, who provide the majority of the administration and 'back office' services that ensure the efficient day-to-day operation of the Oyster card scheme. This includes the ticketing systems, some customer services and the customer relationship database.
If you use your Oyster card on National Rail services or river services, we may share your personal data with the companies operating these services for the same purposes as TfL handles your data - that is customer services and administration, the provision of travel related information, customer research and fraud prevention. Information about sharing pseudonymised journey data is provided in the Obtaining and using your personal information section of this webpage.
Where you have agreed to receive marketing messages from train operating companies, we will pass them your contact details.
If you appeal against a penalty fare notice issued on a National Rail service and you state that you used your Oyster card for that journey, the independent appeals body may verify the information you provide against journey data held in our ticketing systems. This is strictly for the purpose of assessing your appeal, and any information sharing is managed in accordance with relevant privacy and data protection legislation.
We have partnerships with a number of academic institutions in the UK, who work with us to analyse journey patterns and undertake travel modelling to help us understand the way our customers travel so we can improve and plan our services for the future.
Pseudonymisation, or other appropriate data minimisation techniques are applied and all academic research using this information is carried out in accordance with privacy and data protection legislation and protected by robust confidentiality agreements.
In some circumstances, disclosures of personal data to the police (and other law enforcement agencies) are permitted by data protection legislation, if they relate to the prevention or detection of crime and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Before any such disclosure takes place, the police are required to demonstrate that the personal data concerned will assist them in this respect. Each police request to TfL is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with data protection legislation.
We may also receive or disclose personal information about customers in relation to certain emergency situations or other incidents that require an immediate response. Such events may include those involving public health, public safety or national security matters, when access to personal information is necessary to manage the incident. In some situations, we may also be required by law to disclose your personal data to the police or other enforcement, regulatory or Government body, upon a valid request to do so. These requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and take into account privacy considerations before a disclosure is made.
Overseas processing
TfL, its service providers and academic research partners currently process personal information relating to Oyster within the UK and the European Economic Area. Any such processing is subject to appropriate contractual safeguards and carried out in accordance with the requirements of UK and EU privacy legislation.
Using the TfL Oyster and contactless app
If you download and use our mobile TfL Oyster and contactless app, certain information may be collected automatically. This may include the type of mobile device you are using and its unique identifier (such as the device name or ID), Internet Protocol (IP) address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, and IMEI number.
We also use analytics (similar to cookies on websites) which are small files that capture data to help us improve the app's performance. We use them to collect information about your use of the app, such as what app content you access most frequently, or if you receive an error message when using the app.
If you opt in, we will also send you notifications via the app. You can change your mind at any time by amending the settings within your device.

Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest. View our list of partners to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors
762
Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Vendors

Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Vendors
571
Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

Privacy & data protection policy
Privacy & data protection policy
We process personal data in compliance with data protection legislation and we ensure that our staff are aware of their obligations when processing personal data on behalf of TfL.
Purpose

Responsibility for privacy and data protection compliance

Policy owner
Annex: The Data Protection Principles (General Data Protection Regulation Article 5)
Purpose
1. The objective of this policy is to ensure that:
(a) Personal Data is Processed by TfL in compliance with the requirements of data protection legislation and other relevant information governance legislation; and
(b) TfL Personnel are aware of their obligations when Processing Personal Data on behalf of TfL.
Definitions
2. Cyber Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT): a business unit within the Technology and Data department of Customers, Communication and Technology.
3. Data Controller: the organisation (alone, jointly or in common with other organisations) which determines the manner and purposes for which Personal Data is to be processed.
4. Data Processor: processes data on behalf of the Data Controller (other than an employee).
5. Data Protection Legislation: General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 and, any other legislation in force from time to time in the United Kingdom relating to privacy and/or the processing of personal data. Data protection legislation governs the way in which Data Controllers such as TfL can process an individual's Personal Data. It also gives individuals certain rights regarding the information that is held about them and obliges TfL to respond to any requests from an individual to access their own Personal Data.
6. Data Protection Officer: A statutory requirement of the GDPR is the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO). TfL and its subsidiaries will appoint a single DPO, reporting to a member of the Executive Committee and will ensure that the DPO is able to operate independently and is provided adequate resources to meet their GDPR obligations.
7. Data Protection Principles: a set of statutory requirements, which all Data Controllers are obliged to adhere to. The Principles balance the legitimate need for organisations such as TfL to process Personal Data against the need to protect the privacy rights of the Data Subject.
8. Data Subject: an individual who is the subject of Personal Data.
9. Information Commissioner: the regulator appointed by the Crown to promote public access to official information and protect personal information. Compliance with the Data Protection Legislation is enforced by the Information Commissioner.
10. Internal Audit: a department within the Risk and Assurance function of General Counsel.
11. Personal Data: any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified by that information, in particular by reference to an identifier, including name, identification number, location data or online identifier. Personal Data includes expressions of opinion and indications of intention, as well as factual information, and may include pseudonymised data where it is possible to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual.
12. Personal Data Breach: the loss, destruction, damage, theft, inappropriate use or unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data.
13. Personal Information Custodians: senior managers, who are responsible for the Processing of Personal Data within their assigned area of control.
14. Privacy and Data Protection Team: a business unit within the Information Governance department of General Counsel.
15. Privacy Risk: that part of TfL's overall risk portfolio which relates to the, integrity, availability and confidentiality of Personal Data.
16. Processing/Processed: includes collecting, recording, storing, retrieving, transmitting, amending or altering, disclosing, deleting, archiving and destroying Personal Data.
17. TfL Personnel: includes all TfL employees as well as all temporary staff, contractors, consultants and any third parties with whom special arrangements (such as Data Processor, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements) have been made.
18. Transport for London (TfL): the statutory corporation and its operating subsidiaries.
Organisational scope
19. This policy applies to all TfL Personnel and to all Personal Data Processed by or on behalf of TfL at any time, by any means and in any format.
Policy statement

Annex: The Data Protection Principles (General Data Protection Regulation Article 5)
1. Personal data should be
a) processed fairly and lawfully and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.
TfL will use Personal Data fairly and identify a lawful basis for processing. In any circumstance in which individuals provide TfL with their Personal Data for the first time, or if it is processed for a new purpose, they will be informed of:
the identity and contact details of the Data Controller and Data Protection Officer;
the purposes and lawful basis for the processing;
any the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data;
the period for which the personal data will be stored;
the rights of the individual regarding the processing of their personal data including the rights to access and data portability, rectification and erasure, restriction of processing and the right to object to processing.
the consequences of not providing the personal data required under statute or for contractual purposes; and
the existence of, and rights relating to, automated decision making including profiling.
b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes
TfL will only process Personal Data for the purpose(s) which the Data Subject was previously informed of and it will not be used for any other purpose that is incompatible with the original purpose(s). Subject to appropriate safeguards being agreed with the Privacy and Data Protection team, further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes
c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimisation')
TfL will ensure that only the minimum Personal Data necessary for the purpose is processed and will not collect or hold Personal Data solely on the basis that it might be useful in the future. There should always be a legitimate business reason for the Processing of Personal Data linked to a specific ongoing purpose.
d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
Data will be inaccurate where it is incorrect or misleading as to any matters of fact.
There must be processes in place to maintain the quality of data capture at the point data is first collected or obtained by TfL, and to accurately amend, update or correct Personal Data.
e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed
Business areas must implement appropriate retention periods and ensure that Personal Data is securely destroyed once the purpose(s) for processing the Personal Data has come to an end; and there is no legal requirement or valid business/operational reason for its continued retention.
Personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures agreed with the Privacy and Data Protection Team.
f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures
TfL's standard contractual clauses on data protection must be used in any circumstances where Processing of Personal Data on behalf of TfL is carried out by a service provider or other third party.
The Privacy and Data Protection Team must be consulted in the early stages of any project or proposed change to a business process that has any significant implications for the Processing of Personal Data.
Personal Data will be managed in accordance with TfL's Information Security Policy.
TfL Personnel must report any actual or suspected incident, which either has or is likely to, result in the loss, theft, unauthorised disclosure, accidental destruction or other compromise of Personal Data directly to CSIRT and the Privacy and Data Protection Team in accordance with the Data Breach Procedures.
TfL will comply with the restrictions in data protection legislation on the transfer of Personal Data outside the UK and the European Economic Area (which consists of the member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein). The Privacy and Data Protection Team must be consulted in advance of any such transfers being undertaken or agreed.

You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors
528
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.
Vendors
524
Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors
762
Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Vendors

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Vendors
483
Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Vendors
571
Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
See the partners we work with below. Expand each one to see how they process your data. You can object to legitimate interest processing per vendor.

providing services on the DLR and London Overground, bus companies and those
that administer the Congestion Charge and provide ticketing and information
services.
TfL may also share your personal information with
the police and other law enforcement agencies for the purposes of crime
prevention or detection.
If we disclose your information, we ask the
organisation to demonstrate that the data will assist in the prevention or
detection of crime, or that TfL is legally obliged to disclose it.
This is done on a strictly case-by-case basis and
through a tightly controlled process to ensure we comply with data
protection legislation.

protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have
collected from you via our websites.
The internet, however, is not generally a secure
medium of communication and we cannot guarantee the security of any information
you input on this website or send to us via the internet.
