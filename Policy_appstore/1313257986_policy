Privacy Statement
Startselect offers the best for all your digital gaming needs: fast, simple, and reliable. To do this in the best way possible, we sometimes require personal data from our most important co-op player: you! We promise to handle your personal information with the utmost care so you can spend your time gaming instead of worrying about your privacy or data being misused.
When you use our services and visit the website www.startselect.com (‘Website’), it is possible that your personal data will be processed.
The Website and services offered are managed by us, Startselect B.V. (referred to as ‘we’ or ‘us’ in this statement). We are responsible for the careful handling of all personal data. We adhere to all privacy legislation requirements, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means that we only process your data when it is necessary and lawful. It is not compulsory to share personal information, but without providing us with the personal data as stated in this privacy statement, it is possible that you cannot use our services and/or Website anymore, or the services and/or Website do not function as they were intended. One of the other requirements is that we inform you properly about how we handle your personal data. This Privacy statement does exactly that.
What data is collected?
We collect the data you provide when you create an account, use our services, or contact us. This includes your name, email address, residential address, date of birth and phone number. Our customer support services additionally use your order ID and/or user ID when you have an inquiry about your order. In addition to this, we may process login credentials, IP address, used device, behavioural, browser data, analytical and cookies data, and payment information. Depending on the product and whether an assessment has to be conducted, we may process your ID or passport, and bank details.
Why data is collected
We use your information on grounds of the consent you have provided, the performance of our contract, based on legal obligations, and legitimate interests. We may use your information for the following purposes:

marketing and transactional communications you receive from us, as well as other notifications and advertisements you see in our webshops;

Duration of the data storage
We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including our providing products and services, maintaining accurate records, and complying with legal obligations (as outlined in this privacy statement). Once the data is no longer needed, it will be securely deleted or completely anonymized , unless we’re legally obliged to keep it longer.
