Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 2023
This Privacy Policy governs the ways Cedar Electronics Corporations, its subsidiaries - including, Cobra Electronics Corporation and Escort, Inc. - and affiliates (“Cedar”, “we” or “us”) collects, stores, uses, shares and protects your information on the Site.  The Site is defined as the COBRA.COM website, the ESCORTRADAR.COM website, the DRIVE SMARTER mobile app, the iRadar mobile app, the Drive-HD app.  When you access, browse or use the Site, information will be collected, transferred, processed, stored, and/or disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  You should read this Privacy Policy in full.  By accessing, browsing, or using the Site, including without limitation purchasing Products via the Site, you acknowledge to have read and understood the information pertaining to the collection, transfer, use, processing and storage of your information, including personal data, as described in this Privacy Policy.
Any capitalized terms not defined herein have such definitions as set forth in the Terms of Use (“Agreement”), also posted on the Site. This Privacy Policy is incorporated in the Agreement as if this Privacy Policy was fully set forth therein. We reserve the right to modify the terms, conditions and notices under this Privacy Policy from time to time.  You should review these terms periodically to understand the terms that govern your use of the Site.   Where such changes to this Privacy Policy are substantial, we will also notify you by other means prior to the changes taking effect, such as by sending you an email notification. By continuing to use our Site thirty days after such revisions are in effect, you will be deemed to accept and agree to the revisions and to abide by them.
Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of your information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information.  Your non-termination or continued use of the Site after changes are posted or in accordance with the notice period stated if notified to you, constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as modified by the posted changes.
Personal DATA
Personal Data Collected.
Cedar collects different kinds of personal data from you when you use our Site, below are some examples:
Identity Data includes first name, last name and business name
Contact Data includes address, email address and telephone numbers; Emergency Contact information (all optional) includes first name, last name, mobile number and email
Profile Data includes your username and password; blood type (optional), allergies (optional), medication (optional); Insurance Information (optional) includes insurance number, phone number, email, policy number
Payment Data includes credit card number and expiration date
Preferences Data includes car make/model/year and personal product interests (optional)
Technical Data includes IP address and your login data (IP address may be used to infer your location)
Other Information includes information that, by itself does not individually identify you, such as browser type, operating system, the webpages you viewed and how long you viewed them
If you browse the Site, you may generally do so anonymously without providing any personal data. However, there are cases in which we may ask you for personal data. Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, this means a human being. Anonymous data, where you cannot find out who the data relates to, is not personal data.
When you place an order for a product, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This personal data is required so that we can process and fulfill your order, send an order or shipping confirmation, as well as notify you of your order status.
All internet transactions with Cedar are performed on a secure server that encrypts your credit card information to ensure it is not read by unauthorized third parties.
We may collect anonymized details about your use of the Site for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. Aggregated data (your data combined with other people’s data) may come from your personal data, but, if it does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity, it is not considered personal data. For example, we may combine and analyze your use of the Site to work out the number of users accessing a specific website feature.
Methods for Collecting Personal Data.
We use different methods to collect data from and about you, including when you fill out a form or give us information via the phone, by post, online or by email or otherwise. Other instances where we may collect information are, when you:
Visit our Site or social media pages (e.g. through cookies);
Enter a competition or promotion;
Sign up for our mailing list;
Inquire about or order products through our Site or via phone, fax, email, post or in person;
Buy our products or services;
Create an account on our Site;
Provide feedback;
Fill in a form on our Site; and/or
Otherwise contact us.
Account Registration
. You are not required to have an account to purchase Products on the Site. However, you can create a user account with a unique user name and password combination.  If you choose to create a user account, you must provide current, complete, and accurate information to us in connection with your account and/or purchase of Products in order to receive Products from the Site.  It is your responsibility to keep the information that you provide to us up to date and we cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful, or complete information, or if you fail to update the information you give us. During the account set-up process, you are required to give certain contact information, including your name and e-mail address.  We use this information to contact you about the Products on the Site in which you have expressed interest.  We will indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.  The information that you provide to Cedar will not be processed or disclosed by Cedar expect as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required or allowed by applicable law or legal process.
Age of Consent.
By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority and consent in your country, state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority and consent in your country, state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site, and that you have the legal capacity to enter into this contract.
Information from third parties
. Personal data may be collected by us and by our third-party service providers who assist us in operating the Site.  For example, we use Shopify to power our online store—you can read more about how Shopify uses your personal data here:
https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy
. In addition, we may on occasion supplement the personal data you submit to us with information from AWS (Amazon Web Services), Firebase, Facebook, Instagram, Google, Cybba and Bing.  These third-party companies may use your contact information for communications and marketing purposes that support our mission and activities.  You are under no obligation to respond and the companies are restricted from using your contact information for any other purpose.  We will ensure that any service provider with which we share Personal Data agrees to safeguard it in substantially the same manner as we have described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with all applicable laws.
Orders and Payment Processing
. If you purchase Products from us, we request certain personally identifiable data from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and address) and, where applicable, financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date, and validation number). We use this information for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we may use this information to contact you.
We use a third party service provider (currently Shopify) to process credit card transactions.  The credit card information that you provide is encrypted and transmitted directly to Shopify.  We do not store your credit card information and do not control and are not responsible for Shopify or their collection or use of your information.  If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.  All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.  PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers. You may find out more on how Shopify stores and uses your credit card information by accessing
Shopify's Privacy Policy
.

Personal Data Retention
.  Your personal data will be stored by us for as long as necessary in order to fulfil the purposes described above in this Privacy Policy and comply with minimum retention periods under applicable data protection laws. However, unless otherwise required by applicable data protection laws, this period will last for no longer than 10 years from the collection of your personal data, or 10 years following your latest use of the mobile app, whichever period is the longest. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, your personal data will be stored for as long as may be necessary for legal establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Security
To protect your personal data, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.
Disclosure of information
We do not sell or rent any of your personal data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. However, we may disclose your personal data to our subsidiaries, which are either subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective of your rights as those described in this Privacy Policy. The following sections describe some additional ways that we may disclose your personal data in the normal course of operating our business and providing the Site and Products.
Agents and service providers
. We may use third parties to provide services on our behalf to help us operate the Site. For instance, we use credit card processing companies to bill you for Product, and we may use third-party service providers to provide advertising, analytics, and certain fulfillment services for some of our Products.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, except as indicated in this Privacy Policy, our agents and service providers do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable data that we disclose to them to help us operate the Site for any other purposes.  A current list of third party providers that have access to collected personal data include, Facebook, Google, Cybba, Shopify, NetSuite, FreshDesk, Yotpo, Avalara, Adyen, Celigo, FreshDesk, SendOwl, Klaviyo, Address Validator, Snow, Riess Group, Group8A, Shop Protect, Stocklist Store Locator, StorView, Gleam and Amazon AWS.
Reviews
. Because Reviews are publicly available, we urge you not to submit, as part of any Review, any personally identifiable data or any other data that you do not want to share with anyone else.  If you submit a Review, your User ID will be displayed on any content that your post and will be available to the public. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, your name will be available to the public. Any other data about yourself that you include in such posts will be publicly available.
Other disclosures
. We may disclose personal data about you to others: (a) if we have your valid consent to do so; (b) to comply with a valid subpoena, legal order, court order, legal process, or other legal obligation; (c) to enforce any of our terms and conditions or policies; or (d) as necessary to pursue available legal remedies or defend legal claims. We may also transfer your personal data to an affiliate, a subsidiary or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Cedar’s business, assets or stock, including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding, provided that any such entity that we transfer personal data to will not be permitted to process your personal data other than as described in this Privacy Policy without providing you notice and, if required by applicable laws, obtaining your consent.
opt-out policy
We would like to send you information about products and services of ours, which may be of interest to you such as product updates, special offers, important issues and new products of Cedar. If you have consented to receive marketing, you may opt out at a later date.  We provide this “opt-out” when you make your purchase, sign-up for an account, and following the unsubscribe instructions in marketing e-mails. You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes or giving your information to other companies.  You may also “opt-out” from receiving marketing materials and offers and promotions by contacting us at:1701 Golf Road, Tower 3, Suite 900, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008.
.
California Shine the Light Law
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed personal data (as defined under that statute) of that California resident, for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of that kind of personal data that was disclosed to them. California residents can request this disclosure by sending a request to 1701 Golf Road, Tower 3, Suite 900, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008 or by email to contactus@cedarelectronics.com. To help us process your request, please provide sufficient information to allow us to identify you in our records.
Transfer, processing and storage of Personal DATA
As a global organization with affiliated entities located inside and outside of the EU/EEA and business processes in operation across borders, we may transfer your personal data to Cedar’s headquarters in the Unites States, Illinois, to any Cedar affiliate entity worldwide or to third-party business partners, providers, vendors, or contractors, that are located inside or outside of the EU/EEA, for purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including for the purpose of data processing or storage on behalf and under the control of Cedar.
Cedar will perform any cross-borders transfer in compliance with applicable privacy and data protection regulations, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of personal data (“GDPR”). Where mandated by applicable law, to ensure that your personal data does receive an adequate level of protection, Cedar implements the appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data is treated across Cedar affiliated entities and by the aforementioned third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the applicable privacy and data protection laws. Measures consist of Standard Contractual Clauses.
THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”)
If you reside within the European Union you may be entitled to other rights under the GDPR. These rights are summarized below. We may require you to verify your identity before we respond to your requests to exercise your rights. If you are entitled to these rights, you may exercise these rights with respect to your personal data that we collect and store:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at
Contact Us
.
Links to other sites
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Site. The Site contains links that take you to other sites or allow you to share information with other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. For example, the Site and e-mails we send you may include links that will take you directly to a third-party site or that will enable you to post information about the Products you purchase on third-party social media web sites.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the terms of use or privacy practices of those other sites. We encourage you to be aware of and read the terms of use and privacy statements of each and every third-party web site that may collect your personally identifiable information.
Access to personal DATA
You have the right to access, free of charge, obtain a paper or electronic copy, review, correct and update all your personal data stored by us, notably to confirm its accuracy. Subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, you may also oppose to or limit the processing or your personal data or request that certain of your personal data be deleted from our files.
If you reside within the EU, you may also exercise you right to portability of your personal data where the lawful basis for the processing is (i) (a) a contract or (b) your consent and (ii) by automated means. Please note that such a request could be limited to the sole personal data you provided us with or that we hold at that given time and subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures.
Cedar will make reasonable efforts to comply with the aforementioned requests, unless such requests are prohibited by law, or there is a legitimate purpose to retain your personal data, in which case we will inform you without undue delay. We reserve the right to verify your identity before any request relating to your personal data processed by us. Please direct any questions about your personal data using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Any individual who wishes to opt out can do so freely and at any time by contacting Cedar at using the contact details provided in this Privacy Policy, further to the information process relating to the new purpose or clicking on the link within each of our marketing communications.

Introduction
In our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use information about you, our
merchants using Shopify
to power your business
customers
who shop at a Shopify-powered business
partners
who develop apps for merchants to use, build stores on behalf of merchants, refer potential entrepreneurs to Shopify, or otherwise help merchants operate or improve their Shopify-powered business
users of Shopify apps
and services like
Shop
or
Shop Pay
visitors to
Shopify’s websites
, or anyone contacting
Shopify support
This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the Shopify admin or by email).
Our values
Trust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy.
Your information belongs to you
We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit.
We protect your information from others
If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.
We help merchants and partners meet their privacy obligations
Many of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way. We also provide detailed FAQs and documentation covering the most important privacy topics, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive.
Why we process your information
We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:
preventing risk and fraud
answering questions or providing other types of support
helping merchants find and use apps through our app store
providing and improving our products and services
providing reporting and analytics
testing out features or additional services
assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications
We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.
We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, to understand our purposes for processing, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data.
Your rights over your information
We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use Shopify, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information. We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights. Please note that a number of these rights apply only in certain circumstances, and all of these rights may be limited by law.
If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase or interaction, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with. We are a processor and process information on their behalf. We will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests to the extent required by law, such as by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions.
If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with, please submit your data subject request through our
online portal
. Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents. Further information about rights available to US residents can be found below under the header “United States Regional Privacy Notice”.
If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. If you are located in the EEA or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.
Finally, because there is no common understanding about what a
“Do Not Track”
signal is supposed to mean, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way.
Where we send your information
We are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it. We take steps to protect your information when we send your information across borders.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant.
Transfers outside of Europe and Switzerland
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd. Your information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States. When we send your personal information outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found adequately protects your information. If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our
Subprocessors
), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in the
Standard Contractual Clauses.
Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order). For information about how we respond to such orders, please review our
Guidelines for Legal Requests
.
How long do we retain your information
We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies. If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us, we will delete your information or store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, for further details on the retention of your personal information.
Our use of Machine Learning
One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like “machine learning” (some laws, including certain EEA and UK laws, may refer to this as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have legal or similarly significant effects (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).
How we protect your information
Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You can find more information about our security measures at

Why we collect and share your Personal Information
We use and share your personal information for the purposes set out in the Shopify Privacy Policies. For categories of sensitive personal information that we collect, we only use or disclose such information either with your specific consent when required, or as otherwise permitted by law.
Sources of Personal Information
To make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use personal information provided by:
You: We collect the information you provide when you use our platform, including when you sign up for Shopify as a merchant, visit a Shopify-powered store, fill in order information, visit one of Shopify’s websites or contact Shopify support. We collect account and payment information you provide to us (including information about your business if you are a merchant), Shopify stores or items you save to favorites, purchases you make, reviews you post, and how you otherwise interact or communicate with stores or other users on our apps or services. We also collect information about how you browse through our apps and sites, including search terms you may enter.
Your device(s): We collect information from and about the devices you use, including computers, phones, and other web-connected devices you use to access our apps or services, and we combine this information across different devices you use.
Third parties: We receive information from partners who help us provide you with our services including the following:
Email providers. If you use the Shop App and you connect your third party inboxes, such as Gmail or Outlook (according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law), we receive information to identify shopping-related emails and display within Shop information about specific orders you have made, stores you have engaged with in the past, and other related information.
Service Providers. We receive information from our service providers, who help us provide services to our merchants, like reviewing accounts for fraud or other concerns.
Marketplaces. If you use the Shop App, we receive information about purchases you have made from other marketplaces or platforms, such as Amazon, that you choose to connect through Shop. This information helps us to provide and improve Shop, to personalize your experience using our apps and services, and to determine if you are eligible for specific offers or payment methods.
Subprocessors. We work with third party subprocessors for cloud hosting, content delivery, data analysis, internal logging, fulfillment services and email transmission, among others, to provide you with our services. For more information, see Shopify’s subprocessors.
Analytics and cookie providers. We receive information through our use of cookies, social plugins (such as the Facebook “like” button), pixels and tags for business purposes, such as providing information to help measure how users interact with our website content. For more information about how we use these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.
How long we keep your information
Because we need your personal information to provide Shopify services, we generally keep your personal information, including sensitive personal information, while you use Shopify products or services or until you tell us to delete your information. We may also keep personal information to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests.
If you are a merchant operating a Shopify-powered store, and you close the store, stop paying your subscription fees, or we terminate your account, we retain store information for two years before we begin the deletion process.
When you visit or make a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, we act as a service provider or processor for the merchant, and the merchant, not Shopify, decides how long your information is retained.
Your rights over your information
Depending on where you live, how you use Shopify, and subject to certain exceptions, you may have some or all of the following rights:
Right to Know: The right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect, use, or disclose about you, and information about our data practices.
Right to Request Correction: The right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.
Right to Request Deletion: The right to request that we delete personal information that we have collected about you.
To exercise your rights, including the “right to know” and “right to delete,” please submit a request through our online portal. If you use Shop or Shop Pay, please visit
https://shop.app/delete-account
for instructions on how to request deletion of your information.
If you have visited or made a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, please contact the specific merchant directly. If you make a request to us, we will forward your request to the relevant merchant.
Please note that to protect your information and the integrity of our products and services, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In some cases we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as your email address or a government issued ID.
Under US Privacy Laws, you may also designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may need to collect additional information, such as a government issued ID, to verify your identity before processing your request to protect your information.
For information on the CCPA requests we have received, please see here. In certain states, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to these rights. If you wish to appeal a decision, please contact Shopify Support.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
How you can reach us
If you would like to ask about or have concerns about how we process your personal information, please contact Shopify Support. If you want to make a request relating to your personal information, please contact us using the methods set out in the section immediately above.
