INFORMATION ABOUT COOKIES
We use cookies and other similar technologies on the SelfPay Now mobile application, both for our own benefit and for your benefit, such as your secure authentication in SelfPay systems; analysis of your traffic, tendencies, behaviours and interests online.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small-size file, a special text, often coded, sent by a server to a web browser and then sent back (unchanged) by the browser, every time when that server is accessed. The cookie is installed by the request sent by a web server to a browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla), and it is fully “passive” (it does not contain software, viruses or spyware, and it cannot access information on the user’s drive). Cookies are used to monitor user behaviours; some of the typical applications are to remember the user preferences and implement the “shopping cart” system. These files make it possible to recognise the user’s terminal and present the content in a relevant manner, adapted to the user’s preferences. Cookies ensure a pleasant browsing experience for the user and support SelfPay’s efforts to offer convenient services to its users, e.g., online privacy preferences. They are also used in preparing anonymous aggregated statistics that help with understanding how a user uses the SelfPay application or website, thus enabling improvements of structure and content, but excluding the personal identification of the user.
What types of cookies does SelfPay use?
SelfPay uses two types of cookies: per session, and fixed cookies (temporary files that remain in the user’s terminal until the end of the session or until the application/web browser is closed).
Fixed files remain on the user’s terminal for a period within the parameters of the cookie or until deleted by the user manually. The cookies used by the operator’s partners, including, but not limited to the users of the web page, are subject to that respective confidentiality policy.
A visit on the SelfPay Now website or application will place the necessary cookies, which are essential for you to receive the Services, and for which your consent is not needed.
Additionally, depending on your consent, SelfPay may place:
Visitor analysis cookies
Marketing cookies
The personal data collected by the use of cookies will only be collected to facilitate certain features for the user, and is encrypted in a way that makes it impossible for unauthorised persons to access it. In general, an application used for accessing web pages allows cookies to be saved on the terminal by default. These settings can be changed so that the automatic management of cookies is blocked by the web server or the user is informed every time when cookies are sent to their terminal. Detailed information about the possibilities and the ways of managing cookies can be found in the setting area of the application (web browser).
Limiting the use of cookies may affect certain features of the application. Cookies are the central element of the efficient operation of the Internet, and help generate a friendly browsing experience, adapted to every user’s preferences and interests. Refusing or disabling cookies may render some sites impossible to use. Due to their flexibility and the fact that most of the most visited and the biggest sites use cookies, these are almost inevitable; disabling cookies will restrict the user’s access to the most widespread and used websites, such as Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.
Examples of important uses of cookies:
content and services adapted to the user’s preferences – categories of products and services;
use of local storage function – meaning, accessing those storage spaces in a device, where information can be stored;
use of scripts – meaning, using code to collect information about you;
use of tracking pixels – meaning, using a monitoring mechanism to check whether you actually made the purchase included in the offer you reserved;
user interest-adapted access –
measuring, optimisation, and analytics features – such as confirming a certain traffic level on a website, the type of content that is viewed, and how a user gets on a website (e.g., through search engines, directly, from other websites, etc.). Websites carry out these use analysis to improve the sites for the benefit of the users
third-party cookies – because the content that we provide through SelfPay Now on the mobile device is facilitated through third-party service providers, as described above, such as:
Google Analytics for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Facebook Ads
Google Ads
Security clarifications and confidentiality matters
Cookies are NOT viruses, and they use plain text formats; they are not made of pieces of code, so they cannot be executed or run by themselves. Therefore, they cannot be duplicated or replicated on other networks in order to run or replicate again. As they cannot carry out these functions, they cannot be considered as viruses.
