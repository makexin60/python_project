NOTICE REGARDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION: These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern the resolution of claims between You and HER. They also include an agreement to arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration. Unless you opt out, You will only be able to pursue claims against HER on an individual basis, not as part of any class or representative action or proceeding, and You will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.

It is Your responsibility to check these Terms of Use periodically for changes, as these changes are binding on You.
2. Access, License and Privacy.
Provided You are not under the age of 18 years old, we hereby grant You a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Services (the "License").

In addition to Individual Accounts, HER provides licensed physicians and medical professionals working under the supervision of licensed physicians with the ability to purchase a professional account ("Professional Account").  The Professional Account is for use by the medical practice who purchases the License rights to it for the purpose of assisting in the treatment of patients whose Individual Accounts are linked to the Professional Account.  Please see our Fees & Payment Policy for information on the fees, payment provisions, term and additional termination rights for Professional Accounts.

You further agree that Your account is personal to You and that You will not provide any other person access to the Services, or any portions of the same, using Your user name, password or other security information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of Your user name or password or any other breach of security. You should use particular caution when accessing Your account from a public or shared computer or other device so that others are not able to view or record Your password or other personal information.
We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by You or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, You have violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

The Services may contain links to third party websites ("Linked Sites"). We do not control these Linked Sites and are not responsible for the content of, stability of, or any transmission to or from any Linked Site.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THE SITE IS INTENDED TO BE OR WILL BE TAKEN AS MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE INFORMATION POSTED ON THE SERVICES HAS BEEN OBTAINED BY REVIEWING PRODUCT LABELS AND, IN SOME CASES, FROM THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE PRODUCTS, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED BY HER. WHILE HER BELIEVES THAT THIS INFORMATION WAS ACCURATE AT THE TIME IT WAS POSTED TO THE SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT HER DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OF ANY OF THE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE SERVICES.

ACTUAL PRODUCT PACKAGING AND MATERIALS MAY CONTAIN MORE AND DIFFERENT INFORMATION THAN WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY SOLELY ON THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST ALWAYS READ LABELS, WARNINGS, AND DIRECTIONS BEFORE USING OR CONSUMING A PRODUCT. WHILE HER WORKS TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCT INFORMATION IS CORRECT, IT HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED THE PRODUCT INFORMATION, AND ON OCCASION, MANUFACTURERS MAY ALTER THEIR INGREDIENTS AND/OR INGREDIENT LISTS. ACTUAL PRODUCT PACKAGING AND MATERIALS MAY CONTAIN MORE AND/OR DIFFERENT INFORMATION THAN THAT CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES. FURTHER, SOME MANUFACTURERS MAY WITHHOLD CERTAIN INGREDIENTS FROM THEIR PRODUCT INGREDIENT LISTS AS TRADE SECRETS, WHICH HER HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING OR IDENTIFYING. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT A PRODUCT, PLEASE CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER DIRECTLY. CONTENT CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES IS FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE. YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS INFORMATION AS SELF-DIAGNOSIS OR FOR TREATING A HEALTH PROBLEM OR DISEASE. CONTACT YOUR HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER IMMEDIATELY IF YOU SUSPECT THAT YOU HAVE A MEDICAL PROBLEM.

7. Indemnification.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the HER Parties from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation of these Terms of Use by You or any other actions connected with Your use of the Services. Your indemnification obligations include without limitation claims arising out of any of Your Content, as well as any claims arising out of acts or omissions by Your employees or agents, and any other person or entity who gains access to HER's services or content through Your username either with Your permission or as a result of Your failure to use reasonable security measures.
8. Injunctive Relief.
Your breach of these Terms of Use may result in immediate and irreparable harm to us, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, and, therefore, You agree that we are entitled to equitable relief to compel you to cease and desist all unauthorized use, evaluation and disclosure of information obtained through the Services, which is in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.
9. Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Class Action.
Except as set forth below, ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING THE PRIVACY POLICY INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT; provided, however, that the following are exceptions to our agreement to arbitrate our disputes:
a) Any claim that qualifies as a small claim in a court of limited subject matter jurisdiction must be brought in such court; and
b) Any claim for injunctive relief may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin intellectual property infringement or misuse.
You may begin an arbitration proceeding by following the American Arbitration Association’s (AAA’s) filing requirements and mailing a request for arbitration and description of Your claim to our registered agent, [Insert Statutory Agent Information]. The AAA’s Rules of Commercial Arbitration will apply (available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879). The arbitrator will have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of this agreement to arbitrate. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT BE EMPOWERED AND DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO HEAR OR DECIDE ANY CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, TO AWARD PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR TO AWARD ATTORNEYS’ FEES TO THE PREVAILING PARTY.
You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by providing written notice of Your intention to do so to HER within 60 days of the earlier of Your first use of the Site or Services or Your registration with the Services.
By using the Site or Services, You agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Arizona, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy incorporated herein by reference) and any dispute or claim of any sort that might arise between you and HER. The prevailing party in any judicial action to enforce this arbitration agreement shall be entitled to a judgment that includes all fees and costs incurred in such action.
10. Legal Compliance.
