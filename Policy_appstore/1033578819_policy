Data Location and Safeguards
Brivo stores all Visitor Data in the continental United States. Brivo maintains a comprehensive, written information security program that contains industry standard, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to Visitor Data. However, because no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of information you submit to us.
Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data
Except as otherwise provided herein, Brivo may share personal information with third parties in connection with the operation of our business and consistent with the purpose for which the personal information was collected. Except as permitted or required by applicable law, Brivo maintains written contracts with these third parties and requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection and security as required by this Privacy and Security Policy. Brivo shall be responsible and liable unless Brivo proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Data Retention
Brivo retains Visitor Data in accordance with our data retention policies and practices. The length of time we keep your information depends upon a number of factors, including the type of information. In general, we retain personal information for as long as we have an ongoing business need to retain it. Following that period, we will delete it.
Data Incidents
If Brivo becomes aware of any improper access, unauthorized use, or disclosure of Visitor Data (a “Data Breach”), Brivo will analyze the facts of the Data Breach in the context of applicable laws, regulations, policies, and contractual obligations to determine the appropriate notification process. Brivo will conduct notifications in a timely manner after becoming aware of a Data Breach and take commercially reasonable steps to minimize harm and mitigate further risks to Visitor Data.
For data transfers to the U.S. from the European Union, UK or Switzerland Brivo adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. Our Data Privacy Framework Statement is available at:
https://www.brivo.com/data-privacy-framework/
.
Other Important Information
Legal Basis for Processing Your Information
Laws in some jurisdictions (including the European Economic Area “EEA”, require us to inform you of our legal basis for processing your information. We collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable law. The legal basis depends on the type of information and the specific context in which we collect it. However, some examples of the legal basis for processing that we rely on are;
Where we need to collect and use the information to provide our services to you;
Where it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to provide security, for research and development, to market and promote the services and to protect our legal rights and interests; or
Where you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g., your employer) have a legitimate interest in doing so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the services.
Making Choices about your data – Laws and regulations include The General Data Protection Directive (“GDPR”) grants individuals certain rights with respect to their data. These include the right to request a copy of your data, to object to our use of your data (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your data, or to request your data in a structured, electronic format. You can exercise these rights by contacting us at the address in the Contact Information section below.
The GDPR provides that we may limit or deny your requests in certain cases. For example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we have compelling legitimate interests to keep, including as required by law. You may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed if you have concerns about your rights.
Other International Users
The Site is hosted in the U.S. If you are a consumer accessing the Site from Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from U.S. laws, your continued use of the Site, which is governed by U.S. law and these terms, indicates your consent to transfer your information to the U.S.
Children’s Privacy
Because protecting the privacy of young children is especially important, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from or about persons under 13 years of age. No part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on the Site without verified parental consent, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.

Brivo Services Privacy Statement
Last Update and Effective:
March 29, 2024
At Brivo
©
, privacy and security are core elements of our service. This Brivo Services Privacy Statement (the “Privacy Statement”) describes Brivo’s privacy practices in relation to the data Brivo receives through the use of hardware, services and applications provided by Brivo (collectively, the “Brivo System”). Brivo Systems LLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this Privacy Statement as “Brivo”.
This Privacy Statement applies to the following:
Personal information that a Customer’s Administrator, or Brivo Reseller, inputs, or uploads or that is otherwise captured by the Brivo System;
Activity and event data that is automatically collected by Customers using the Brivo System; and,
Personal information acquired by or captured about Customers, their users, and visitors, in order to establish or maintain their business relationship with Brivo.
Collectively this is considered “Customer Data”.
Capitalized terms used, but not defined in the Statement, shall have the meanings given in Section 1 (Definitions) of the Brivo Applications Terms of use.
Roles of Customers, Resellers and Brivo in Protection of Customer Data
Brivo provides the Brivo System to Customers via its Reseller channel. Resellers selected by the Customer handle the initial setup and configuration of the Customer’s Brivo account. Customers can choose what data to share with the Reseller and/or Brivo during the set-up process. After the initial set-up, the Customer’s access to the Brivo System is limited to its authorized Administrators.
Customers are responsible for verifying that all individuals who are designated as Administrators are authorized by the Customer for the levels of access granted. In general, Brivo recommends that the Customer designate an employee of the Customer to be the Primary Administrator. If the Customer chooses to permit an individual who is not an employee of the Customer (such as, for example, an employee of a Reseller to have any administrative rights or other access or privileges to the Customer’s account or Customer Data), the Customer is responsible for monitoring the third party’s access to and use of the account and Customer Data. Brivo is not responsible for any unauthorized use or misuse of the Customer’s account access, account privileges or Customer Data by anyone using access provided by the Customer.
Certain Brivo employees also will have access to Customer Data, solely in connection with the provision of the Brivo System and to respond to specific Customer and Brivo Reseller requests for technical support. Brivo will access Customer Data only for the purposes of providing the Brivo System, preventing, or addressing service or technical problems, in accordance with the provisions of any separate written agreement between Brivo and Customer (such as, for example, the Brivo terms of use applicable to the Brivo System (the “Terms of Use”)), or as may be required by law.
COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER DATA
Brivo collects and processes all Customer Data strictly on behalf of Customers in accordance with Brivo’s contractual agreements with them and/or as defined in the Terms of Use and/or as required or permitted by law.
Customers are responsible for ensuring that Customer Data is collected and processed in accordance with all applicable laws. Since Customer Data is managed by the Customer, the Customer is responsible for providing appropriate notice and choice regarding Brivo’s processing of Customer Data on behalf of the Customer. If an individual has any questions or concerns related to Brivo’s handling of Customer Data pertaining to them, he or she may contact us at
privacy@brivo.com
and we will work with the applicable Customer to address the concern.
Brivo may also collect personal information from Customer employees, contractors, or agents in order to properly manage Brivo’s business relationship with Customer. Customers will receive login credentials to manage their Brivo System accounts, including such personal information.
Types of Customer Data Collected Related to the Brivo System
Brivo collects the following types of Customer Data:
Information provided by Customers:
The Brivo System provides the capability for Customers to store basic personal information such as an individual’s name, credential number, email address and photograph. This information is used to correlate events to the correct individual, as well as to enable notifications and mobile application functionality. The Customer is solely responsible for determining if storage of this data is appropriate and permitted in the context of applicable laws and regulations.
Information generated from security events:
The Brivo System is used by the Customer to collect activity and event data. For example, the Customer can use the Brivo System to record that an access credential was used at a particular door at a certain time. Through correlation with the information a Customer provides, Brivo may be able to tie an access event to a particular individual’s credential.
Log Information:
The Brivo System records the actions of Administrators, as well as the status and the settings of various devices that have been configured to operate with the Brivo System. Log information may be used by the Customer to review the activity of Administrators.
Mobile Applications:
Brivo provides mobile applications which can optionally be used with the Brivo System. The Brivo Mobile App provides administrative access to the Brivo System. Brivo Mobile Pass is a form of digital credential used, for example, to authorize physical access to a building. Brivo uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to identify when the device is within proximity to applicable available Brivo readers to open the proper lock or door. In order to use the services of the Brivo Mobile App, various features such as location services, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication must be activated on the mobile device.
Customer Data may be used by Brivo to:
Enable event notifications and Brivo Mobile Pass functionality.
Contact the Customer to inform them of product and service enhancements that Brivo thinks may be of interest to them.
Provide important service notices regarding the Brivo System and related devices. (While Customers use Brivo System services, it will not be possible to opt out of communications regarding Brivo System service notices.)
Ask the Customer to participate in surveys that help Brivo better understand the Customer’s needs in order to improve Brivo products and services.
Brivo also shares data with relevant third-party service providers when explicitly authorized by Administrators in the relevant Brivo System account; for example, to enable integrations via Brivo’s Application Programming Interface (API).
Compliance with General Data Protection Directive (GDPR) Application of the GDPR for Brivo:
In the context of the GDPR, individual residents in the European Economic Area with data stored in the Brivo System or using Brivo applications are considered “Data Subjects.” Customers (and in some cases Brivo Resellers or Brivo API Partners) are considered “Data Controllers.” Brivo is generally a “Data Processor” but can also be a sub-Processor with respect to Customer Data.  Brivo is a Data Controller with respect to User Private Data, as defined in the Terms of Use – Brivo Subscription Services. Brivo’s obligations with respect to User Privacy Data are as set forth in the End User License Agreement – Brivo Mobile Apps.
In Brivo’s role as a Data Processor, Brivo is the responsible custodian of the Data Subject’s data, performing this role on behalf of the Data Controller. The Data Controller is completely responsible for determining what data is captured, stored, and processed within the Brivo System. Brivo does not share, sell, rent or trade personally identifiable information with third parties unless directed by a Data Controller.
Within Brivo’s service model, most Data Subjects will have limited direct interaction with the Brivo System applications that capture and store their data. This interaction by Data Subjects will primarily be via the Brivo Mobile Pass application. Most Data Subjects will be employees, visitors, or contractors of the Data Controller. Data is captured based on their relationship with the Data Controller. The Data Controller is responsible for gaining necessary consent from the Data Subject regarding the data to be stored. In cases where a Data Subject requests Customer Data to be deleted from the Brivo System, Brivo will refer such request to the Data Controller for adjudication.
The GDPR includes provisions that grant Data Subjects portability rights in their personal data. Brivo will coordinate with Data Controllers and, as applicable Data Subjects, when requested to delete or port data. Brivo provides portability and is continually working to enhance its data export capabilities.
GDPR Right of Individual Access and Limited Use
Those residing within the European Economic Area may request access, correct or to limit the use of their personal information within the Brivo System by submitting a request to Brivo at
privacy@brivo.com
or by contacting us as set forth below.
Information Security
Brivo maintains a comprehensive, written information security program that contains industry standard, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data.
Brivo has the distinction of being one of the first building security platforms to be SOC 2 audited and being the first physical security software-as-a-service (SaaS) company to utilize the SSAE 16/18 framework to provide security review. Brivo undertakes an independent third-party annual SOC 2 audit that reviews certain of its internal controls and processes. Brivo also is certified under ISO27001. Brivo recognizes that the GDPR will help it move towards the highest standards of operations in protecting Customer data.
Law Enforcement Requests
Brivo may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Data Location & Transfer of Information
Brivo stores all Customer Data in the continental United States or Europe depending on the instance you use. To facilitate Customers’ global operations, Brivo transfers some information to the United States and provides access to that information to Customers around the world.
Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data
Except as otherwise provided herein, Brivo may share personal information with third parties in connection with the operation of our business and consistent with the purpose for which the personal information was collected.
Data Retention
Brivo retains Customer Data according to the time frames set forth in the Terms of Use – Brivo Subscription Services.
Data Incidents
If Brivo becomes aware of any improper access, unauthorized use, or disclosure of Customer Data (a “Data Breach”), Brivo will analyze the facts of the Data Breach in the context of applicable laws, regulations, policies, and contractual obligations to determine the appropriate notification process. Brivo will conduct notifications in a timely manner after becoming aware of a Data Breach and take reasonable steps to minimize harm and mitigate further risks to Customer Data.
For data transfers to the U.S. from the European Union, the UK (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland, Brivo adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. Our Data Privacy Framework Statement is available at:

Data Privacy Framework Policies
The following privacy principles apply to the transfer, collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information from the E.U., UK and Switzerland by Brivo.

When a Customer transfers or authorizes the transfer of Consumer Personal Information to Brivo in the U.S as a Processor, the Customer is responsible for providing appropriate notice to Consumers and ensuring it is collecting such the Personal Information under a lawful basis such as for example, obtaining the Customer’s requisite consent.
Choice
When Brivo collects Consumer Personal Information in its role as a Controller, Brivo generally offers the relevant Consumers the opportunity to choose whether their Personal Information may be (i) disclosed to third-party Controllers or (ii) used for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which the information was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the relevant Consumer. Consumers may contact Brivo as indicated below regarding Brivo’s use or disclosure of their Personal Information.
When Brivo obtains Consumer Personal Information in its role as a Processor for its Customers, Brivo’s Customers are responsible for providing appropriate notice to its Consumers and ensuring it provides the relevant Consumers with certain choices with respect to the Customers’ use or disclosure of the Consumers’ Personal Information.
Brivo shares certain Consumer Personal Information with its affiliates and subsidiaries. Brivo may disclose Consumer Personal Information without offering an opportunity to opt out and may be required to disclose the Personal Information:
to third-party Processors Brivo has retained to perform services on its behalf and pursuant to it instructions,
if it is required to do so by law or legal process, or
in response to lawful requests from governmental authorities, including to meet national security, governmental interest, or law enforcement requirements.
Brivo also reserves the right to transfer Consumer Personal Information in the event of an audit or if Brivo sells or transfers all or a portion of its business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation).
Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Information
This Statement and Brivo’s Privacy Policies describe Brivo’s sharing of Consumer Personal Information.
To the extent Brivo acts as a Controller, except as permitted or required by applicable law, Brivo shall provide Consumers with an opportunity to opt out of sharing their Personal Information with third-party Controllers.

(ii) provide the same level of protection for Personal Information as is required by the DPF Principles, and
(iii) notify Brivo and cease processing Personal Information (or take other reasonable and appropriate remedial steps) if the third-party Controller determines that it cannot meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection for Personal Information as is required by the DPF Principles.
With respect to transfers of Consumer Personal Information to third-party Processors, Brivo
(i) enters into a contract with each relevant Processor,
(ii) transfers Personal Information to each such Processor only for limited and specified purposes,
(iii) ascertains that the Processor is obligated to provide the Personal Information with at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the DPF Principles,
(iv) takes reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the Processor effectively processes the Personal Information in a manner consistent with Brivo’s obligations under the DPF Principles,

Security
Brivo takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Consumer Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
Brivo seeks to ensure that any Personal Information held about E.U., UK and Swiss individuals is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained.  Brivo collects Personal Information that is adequate, relevant, and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be processed. E.U., UK and Swiss individuals are responsible for assisting Brivo in maintaining accurate, complete, and current Personal Information about them. Subject to applicable law, Brivo retains Consumer Personal Information in a form that identifies or renders identifiable the relevant Consumer only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected or subsequently authorized by the Consumer.
Access and Correction
To the extent Brivo acts as a Controller, and upon written request to Brivo as set forth below, Brivo will (i) provide E.U., UK and Swiss individuals with reasonable access to their Personal Information and (ii) will take reasonable steps to allow E.U., UK and Swiss individuals to review their information for the purposes of correcting their information. There are certain limitations to the Access and Correction right, as set forth on the DPF website.
When Brivo obtains Consumer Personal Information in its role as a Processor for its Customers, Brivo’s Customers are responsible for providing Consumers with access to the Personal Information and the right to correct, amend or delete the information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the DPF Principles, as appropriate. In such circumstances, Consumers should direct their questions to the appropriate Brivo Customer. When a Consumer is unable to contact the appropriate Customer, or does not obtain a response from the Customer, Brivo will provide reasonable assistance in forwarding the Consumer’s request to the Customer.
Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
Brivo has developed internal mechanisms in order to adhere to the DPF Principles.
In compliance with the EU DPF and the UK Extension to the EU DPF and the Swiss DPF, Brivo commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU and UK individuals and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Information received in reliance on the EU DPF and the UK Extension to the EU DPF, and the Swiss DPF should first contact Brivo using the contact information in the “How to Contact Brivo” section of this Statement.
If a Consumer’s complaint cannot be resolved through Brivo’s internal processes, Brivo will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS DPF Program, which is described on the JAMS website at
https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework
. JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS rules. Following the dispute resolution process, the mediator or the Consumer may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has DPF investigatory and enforcement powers. Under certain circumstances, Consumers also may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about Brivo’s compliance with the DPF Principles.
When Brivo obtains Consumer Personal Information in its role as a Processor for its Customers, Consumers may submit complaints concerning the processing of their Personal Information to the relevant Customer, in accordance with the Customer’s dispute resolution process. Brivo will participate in this process at the request of the Customer or the Consumer.
