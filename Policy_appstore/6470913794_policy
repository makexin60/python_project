How does GamProtect work?
Purpose and Legal Basis
Redress Process
Privacy Notice
GamProtect is a project to ensure that people who tell us that they are at high risk from gambling related harm to their health are protected. To do this Participating Operators that provide online gambling products will take steps to identify customers who they believe should not be gambling and share some key customer information with the GamProtect system. Participating Operators will use GamProtect to identify whether the same customer has an account with them and proceed to close their account to reduce the potential for harm.
​
This privacy notice explains how Participating Operators in the GamProtect trial project use your personal data. You can see which operators are participating in the GamProtect trial project by going to the Participating Operators section of this notice.
There are 3 key stakeholders in this process that are defined below:
The “Closing Operator”: this is the Participating Operator that closes your account and can be any of the Participating Operators.
“GamProtect”: this is the system that allows for secure data sharing between all operators in a way that ensures privacy. They will receive customer data from the Participating Operators on a daily basis.
The “Receiving Operators”: these are the Participating Operators who receive a match from the data that is shared by the Closing Operator to GamProtect and the Receiving Operator’s own customer database. If the Receiving Operator and the Closing Operator have the same customer, then they will take a similar action to protect their shared customer e.g., closing the customer’s account.
​
The Receiving Operator will not know the specific reason why the Closing Operator has shared data with them via GamProtect. If your personal data has been shared with GamProtect and you would like to find out why, please contact the Closing Operator. You will receive an email from the Closing Operator informing you that your details will be shared with GamProtect.
How does the GamProtect Trial Work?
Risk Identification
Participating Operators will identify a player as at risk of health-related problem gambling if the player states that they:
Have a gambling problem or addiction.
Are seeking external support or treatment for gambling problems.
Will harm themselves or someone else.
Should not be gambling because they have a medical condition.
Want to stop gambling forever due to problems with their gambling.
Initial Account Closure
Once a Participating Operator has identified a player as at risk of health-related problem gambling, it will close all of the player’s accounts and exclude the player from all of its gambling services.
It will also inform the player that they will be added to GamProtect due to issues with health-related problem gambling.
Registration
The Participating Operator will add the following Registration Data about the player to GamProtect:
Full Name
Surname
Date of Birth
Post Code
Email address
Telephone number
Unique Customer ID set by Participating Operators
Matching
Each Participating Operator will routinely check all their current players’ details against the details of the players previously added to GamProtect by scanning their customer database against the system.
If a player who is playing with one Participating Operator has been previously added to GamProtect by another Participating Operator, GamProtect will provide the Participating Operator carrying out the GamProtect check with the following information about the player
A flag to indicate that the players account has been closed by the Closing Operator because it meets one of the criteria of the project.
Name of Participating Operator that added the player to GamProtect.
Status as added to GamProtect.
Further Account Closures
When a Participating Operator is informed by GamProtect that a player has been identified as being at risk of issues with health-related problem gambling, it will close all the player’s accounts with the company.
Initial active Period
A player will remain on GamProtect and subject to the matching process initially for a period of [five years] from the date they were first added by a Participating Operator. This is known as the .
During the active period all Participating Operators will exclude the player from their gambling services.
The player cannot remove themselves from GamProtect during the active period.
However, if a player thinks they have been added to GamProtect incorrectly, they can follow the GamProtect redress process explained below.
Further Active Period
At the end of the active period (if the player is not removed from GamProtect by the redress process), the player will remain on GamProtect and subject to the matching process for a further active period.
During this further active period all the Participating Operators will continue to exclude the player from their gambling services.
The player can remove themselves from GamProtect at any time during the further active period by contacting the Participating Operator that has prevented them from accessing gambling services using the contact details below.
However, if the player does not remove themselves from GamProtect, the further active period will continue (and they will remain excluded from all Participating Operators’ gambling services) for a period of 35 years.
Archive Period
Following the end of the further active period (either by request or expiry), the player’s details will be held for an archive period of seven years.
Reidentification of Risk
If during a further active period or archive period a Participating Operator re-identifies a player as at risk of health-related problem gambling, the Participating Operator will re-add the player to GamProtect and the active period will restart.
​
Categories of personal data to be processed as part of the GamProtect trial
Purpose & Legal Basis
​
Participating Operators will process customer’s personal data for the primary purpose of identifying customers with health-related issues with problem gambling that are common to any other
Participating Operator and attempting to protect extremely vulnerable people from gambling related harm across those common Operators. This involves:
​
Communicating with a customer to identify a potential harm.
Closing, suspending or restricting the customer’s account.
Sharing customer personal data with GamProtect.
Searching for customers who have been registered on GamProtect.
Evaluating the ongoing effectiveness of the GamProtect solution.
The legal basis for the purpose we have described is the Participating Operator’s legitimate interests in protecting customers from harm. Specifically, these interests are:
​
To improve intervention for people suffering from health-related problem gambling issues.
To share the identification of players who are suffering health-related problem gambling issues.
To provide greater insight into effective ways of reducing people in the UK from suffering health-related problem gambling issues.
A proportionate approach to the identification of people in the UK from suffering health-related problem gambling issues and protect customers without unduly infringing their rights and freedoms.
​
Special category personal data is personal data that can reveal health data and other sensitive information about a person. As the scheme is designed to detect and prevent health-related problem gambling the GamProtect trial data is considered to be special category personal data. Where the processing of customer data involves special category data the legal basis for the Participating Operator’s processing this data is substantial public interests. The substantial public interests are outlined in the UK Data Protection Act 2018 as: safeguarding of children and of individuals at risk.
Recipients of the data
​
Customer data will be shared with the GamProtect system which is owned and provided by Tutelar Limited. (“TUTELAR”) and its subcontractors The Data Shed Limited (Hippo) and Amazon Web Services. We can be compelled to share information within GamProtect with regulators and law enforcement agencies at their request. Participating Operators will also share the flag indicating a health-related problem gambling issue associated with a customer with other Participating Operators. If a Participating Operator ceases to exist, they will share the specific reasons why a customer’s data has been shared to GamProtect with another Participating Operator who will be elected at the time to hold the Closing Operators GamProtect records.  Any player impacted by this action will be informed directly by the elected Operator.
​
We will transfer your personal data to GamProtect who will then confirm matches with the other Participating Operators. We have implemented Standard Contractual Clauses with appropriate addendums to protect the personal data during the transfer.
​
Data Retention
Redress process
If you believe you have been added to GamProtect incorrectly, please contact the Participating Operator that is preventing you from accessing online gambling services using the contact details below.  The Participating Operator will then take you through these steps –
​
If that Participating Operator added you to GamProtect, it will consider your concerns and decide whether or not to remove you from GamProtect.
If the Participating Operator that is preventing you from accessing gambling services did
not
add you to GamProtect, it will provide you with the contact details of the Participating Operator that did add your details to GamProtect.
The Participating Operator that did add your details to GamProtect will then consider your concerns and decide whether or not to remove you from GamProtect.
​
If the company which added your details is no longer participating in GamProtect, you can instead follow the redress process with the Participating Operator whose gambling services you wish to access.
Removal from GamProtect
In addition to the redress process, following the end of the active period, you can ask to be removed from GamProtect at any time by contacting the Participating Operator that has prevented you from accessing gambling services using the contact details below.
Please note that even after your removal from GamProtect, individual Participating Operators may still independently decide to prevent you from accessing their gambling services.

1. Personal information we collect
Information collected automatically.
When a Customer subscribes to our Services, our JavaScript code and/or our SDKs enable the collection of certain device identifiers and IP addresses, and iovation cookies may be placed on your device. This information is no different than the types of information captured by common web analytics tools. The information is sent back to the Customer and subsequently passed onto iovation for further processing.
We may also capture geolocation information, using various technologies to determine the location of your device during specific activities and interactions with a Customer website or app.
In addition, we may collect behavioral information about your interactions with online forms on a Customer’s website or mobile app. This is used to alert our Customers to potentially fraudulent behaviors.
Please visit our
Cookies and Similar Technologies Notice
for more detailed information regarding our tracking technologies.
Additional information our Customers provide to us.
Our Customers may optionally provide us with information, including personal data you provide, about the transactions you carry out on their website or app. This information is used to alert our Customers to potential risk related to the transaction including fraud and system abuse analysis, to fulfill their own regulatory obligations and for other reasons of substantial public interest. They might also optionally provide us with information about the transactions you carry out on their website or app.
Information about our Customers.
If you are a Customer, we may also collect certain personal information about you (from you directly or your employer) to enable us to manage our business relationship with you, such as your name, contact details, job title, billing, and payment information.
Automated Decision Making.
iovation does not conduct automated decision making, although iovation does conduct profiling as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”), which applies to persons situated in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and the EU GDPR as amended and incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom (“UK”) (“UK GDPR”), which applies to persons situated in the UK.
When we refer to profiling, we mean using personal information to make predictions about you, or to categorize you into particular groups. Typically, this would involve determining whether a device is reliable when linked to a transaction through a Customer website or app, or whether it is linked to a fraudulent transaction.
2. Purpose for collecting and use of personal information
Once the information described above has been passed to iovation, we process the data through our Global Device Intelligence Platform to return a score or scores to our Customer for the device. This score is calculated based on rules that are set by our Customers. The rules set by our Customers will depend on the business they operate and the types of fraud or system abuse pertinent to their services. We may also return fraud ‘flags’ related to our analysis.
Once the Customer receives a score, it is up to the Customer to decide what action to take from there. For example, transactions with certain scores may be denied, flagged for review, or presented with further authentication challenges. In most cases, however, the transaction or activity will proceed with no issues.
In addition, we may provide information assessing the risks associated with a phone number or email address.
We may also use personal information we collect through the Services for the following purposes:
To optimize and improve the Services, including the use of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), Machine Learning and data analytics for the purposes of improving fraud detection and prevention services;
To enable our consortium of Customers to share information about known fraudulent or malicious devices;
To deliver our products, which includes the use of machine learning algorithms;
To analyze the use of the Services for internal business purposes;
To provide customer service and support;
To send our Customers communications about their account, provide service updates and marketing information (where it is in accordance with their marketing preferences);
To investigate any lawful or wrongful activity or unauthorized access to our Services and those of our Customers;
To provide services in the substantial public interest; and
For other legitimate business purposes and other purposes about which we will notify you.
3. Lawful basis for processing personal information
Where personal information is collected from the EEA or the UK, it is necessary to have a lawful basis for the processing of personal information. This section explains the legal basis on which we process your personal information.
Legitimate Interests.
The EU, EEA and UK’s data protection law allows the use of personal information where necessary for legitimate purposes provided that this isn’t outweighed by the impact it has on you. The law calls this the “legitimate interests” condition for processing personal information.
Most of our processing activities are based on the legitimate interest condition. This includes almost all of our Fraud Prevention and Device Risk products. These legitimate interests include the processing of personal information strictly necessary for the purposes of prevention of fraud, unlawful acts and other forms of cybercrime. This includes the use of Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning/ Data Analytics for improving our products and fraud detection services under this lawful basis.
We may also process business to business marketing data for the purposes of direct marketing to our business customers under this lawful basis.
Our International Transfers of personal information from the EEA and/or UK to Third Countries outside of the EEA and/or UK (including the United States), is also carried out as a legitimate interest of the business.
Consent.
We sometimes rely on consent in order to process personal information, but this is relatively rare.
Performance of Our Contract with You.
We also use this basis for processing some of our staff data.
Substantial Public Interests.
Where our Device Risk service is used by businesses in regulated industries, such as online gaming, to assist them with their regulatory duties for responsible gaming, personal information may be processed of reasons of substantial public interest where an end-user chooses to self-exclude from online gaming with a Subscriber.
4. Disclosing for a business purpose and selling/sharing personal information
We may share personal information collected through our Website and Services in the following ways:
Information Shared with TransUnion Companies.
We may share any of the above personal information with other members of the iovation and TransUnion Companies for purposes consistent with this Notice
Information Shared with Our Customers.
In making the internet a safer place, we may share personal information with our Subscribers for the fraud protection and account management purposes described above. Our Subscribers provide the online services that iovation protects from online fraud and abuse. We do not share precise geolocation information, except to the extent that we return it to the Subscriber who shared it with us, though we do share scores based on such information. We do not share behavioral information, though we do share scores based on such information with the Subscriber who shared it with us. We do not share information about the transactions you carry out, except to the extent that we return it (and scores/alerts based on such information) to the Subscriber who shared it with us.
Information Shared with Our Service Providers.
We may also engage certain trusted third-party service providers, consultants, or vendors to assist us in the provision of the Website and Services. We will only share your personal information with third parties to the extent necessary to perform such functions and in accordance with the purposes set out in this Notice and applicable laws. Our service providers include Cloud Hosting and Data Warehousing vendors as well as services to identify anomalous behavior to assist with the detection and prevention of fraud.
Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transfers.
In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, acquisition, dissolution, financing or other similar event, your personal information may be shared or transferred in connection with, or during negotiations of, such event or transaction with entities involved in the event or transaction as parties or advisors, or otherwise providing services in connection to the event or transaction.
Information Disclosed for Legal Purposes and Protection of Others.
We may disclose personal information to a third party where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or governmental requests. We will also disclose personal information to the extent we believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, judicial orders, subpoenas, warrants, or other process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; (ii) to protect the vital interests of any person; (iii) to exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights; and (iii) to stop any activity we consider illegal, unethical, or legally actionable.
As a developer of fraud and identity products, iovation and TransUnion may receive requests from law enforcement and other public authorities along with requests from courts and litigation parties across the world for access to personal information. Such information may relate to consumer and customer data associated with legal, criminal and national security investigations and proceedings.
TransUnion understands that the disclosure of information to public authorities is often an important step in combatting financial crime and other unlawful activities. TransUnion also understands the value of personal privacy and the rights granted by privacy and security laws around the world.
TransUnion has therefore put in place policies, procedures and practices to ensure that all such requests are reviewed appropriately and in accordance with the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, and the Chapter V, Article 46 Transfer Mechanism, which enables personal information to be exported from the EU, EEA and UK.
The policies, procedures and practices ensure that TransUnion associates are aware of the nature of local laws and practices, and the legal limits of those laws and practices. Where legally appropriate, requests for access to personal information will be the subject of legal challenge and appeal, irrespective of the sensitivity and context of the request. Furthermore, suitable supplementary measures have been put in place in order to protect personal information that is exported from the EEA and/or UK, to ensure security, integrity and prevent interception of data in transit.
Data Subjects within the EEA or UK are entitled to a copy of the Art.46 GDPR Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) that apply to any such transfer of their personal information outside of the EEA or UK. Requests should be submitted to
