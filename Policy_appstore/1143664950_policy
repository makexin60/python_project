Lezyne recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the Site to which you are connected. Lezyne encourages you to use these tools to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure communications. Lezyne will only retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information will not be used longer than the retention period required or permitted by law.
