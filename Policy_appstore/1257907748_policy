We may collect different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:
Identity or Contact Data:
personal data including app-instance ID, advertising ID (IDFA on iOS and ADID on Android), Internet Protocol (IP) address or similar identifiers. When you contact us about WebLink® services by email or phone

Data Automatically Collected from WebLink Host Application users and Website Visitors

We also use Google Analytics for Firebase and Firebase Crashlytics, services provided by Google LLC (collectively, “Firebase Services”). Firebase Services use an app-instance identifier – a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of a mobile app, advertising identifiers
(IDFA on iOS and ADID on Android) and similar identifiers
. In addition to these identifiers, Firebase Services collect and send to Google LLC device data, IP address, app usage data and app crash logs. The data collected by Firebase Services are exported to and stored in BigQuery, another Google service. The data collected is used to analyze how you use WebLink® services and your demographic data and to improve and develop WebLink® services.

7. Third Party Links
Some content or applications on our Website may be served by third parties, content providers and application providers including the following:
a. Plugins.
Our Website may make available the option for you to use “plugins” that are operated by social media/networking companies. If you choose to use one of these plugins, then it may collect information about you and send it back to the social media company that owns it. This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin, if you are logged into the social media/networking websites that owns the plugin when you visit our Website. Data collected by a plugin is subject to the privacy policy and terms of the social media company that makes it. If you do not want the social media company that owns a plugin to collect information about you when you visit our Website, sign out of the social media network before visiting. By interacting with a plugin when you are on our Website (for example, clicking the Facebook “Like” button), you are intentionally transferring information to that social media/networking company. Further, if you are logged into a social media website when you visit our Website, then you are directing us to share your data with the social media company that owns the plugin.
b. Third Party Links.
Our Website and the WebLink Host Application may contain links to other sites, which we do not control. Those websites have their own privacy policies and terms, and we encourage you to read those terms before interacting with third-party sites.
8. Data Retention
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with Abalta’s services and solutions and for Abalta’s legitimate and essential business purposes, as described in this Privacy Policy, after which we and our data processors will delete or erase your personal data.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Your express agreement may permit us to retain your personal data for a longer period. Furthermore, legal requirements may require us to retain portions or all of the personal data we hold for a longer period of time. For example, we may be required to retain your information for tax, financial reporting, and other regulatory compliance reasons. When we are no longer required to retain your personal data, we will delete or erase your personal data as required by applicable law and regulations.
9. Children
Neither WebLink® services nor our Website are intended for children under 16 years of age or the age where parental or guardian consent is not required under applicable privacy law. We will not knowingly solicit or collect personal data from children under such age, except as permitted under applicable law. If we learn that we have received information directly from a child under such age without his or her parent’s or legal guardian’s consent, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information.
10. International Transfers
Abalta is an international company, and we maintain the information collected and generated in any county or territory, including the United States and Bulgaria, that may have privacy laws that offer different levels of protection from the privacy laws of where you live. If you use WebLink Host Application o
r
th
e
Websi
t
e, you consent to our collection, transfer, processing and use of your personal data in countries and territories outside of those where you reside. We will ensure that your personal data is adequately protected by this Privacy Policy and comply with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
If you are located in the EEA, we have put in place appropriate measures to comply with the laws and regulations to ensure that the transfer of Personal Data to countries outside of the EEA provides an adequate level of data protection, including the following:
Adequacy Decisions
. This means that we transfer personal data to countries outside of the EEA which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. We transfer the personal data described in section 2 (Personal Data We Collect About You) to vendors based in countries outside of the EEA that benefit from an Adequacy Decision.
Standard Contractual Clauses (‘SCCs’).
These clauses require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. We use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in section 2 (Personal Data We Collect About You) to third parties that are based in countries outside of the EEA that do not benefit from an Adequacy Decision. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.
11. Your Rights and Choices
Your rights may vary depending on where you are located. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information.
Marketing
.
If you no longer want us to use your email address or other contact information that you have provided to promote or recommend our own products and services, or third parties’ products or services, you can opt-out by replying to any promotional email we have sent you or following the opt-out links on that message.
Accessing, Updating, and Deleting Your Information.
You can contact us as set forth in the
Contact Us
section below to submit the following types of requests regarding the personal data that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or negatively affect the information’s accuracy.
Request access to your personal data, commonly known as a “data subject access request,” which allows you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request a correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. If we delete your personal data upon your request, we may not be able to provide the WebLink® service to you.
(
EEA and Mexico residents only
) Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to
establish
the data’s accuracy.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
require
it as you need it to
establish
, exercise, or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party
(right to data portability)
. We will
provide to
you, or a third party you have chosen,
your
personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
, to the fullest extent authorized under the applicable law,
this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
perform
a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
processing
carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
certain
WebLink
®
service
to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Unless the retention of your personal data is necessary for
complying with
any applicable law, we will erase your personal data on your withdrawal of consent. However, please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect, use and
disclose
personal data where such collection, use and disclosure without consent is
permitted
or required under applicable laws.
We may make automated decisions about you based on your personal data that may affect your access or services provided to you. You have the right not to be subject the automated decision making so long as the decision is not necessary for the performance of the contract with you or required by legal obligation. If the decision making is necessary, you may contest the decision and request human intervention in the decision-making process.

12. Data Security
The security of your personal data is very important to us. We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose of collecting it. In providing you with the WebLink® service, we host the WebLink-related data, including your personal data, on Amazon Web Service server (AWS), and as described above, we use Google Analytics for Firebase and Firebase Crashlytics.
