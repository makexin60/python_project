— Information which is stored on your computer or mobile device to allow us to 
								securely deliver services like streaming audio and information like website maintenance notifications.
Active data
is the information we request from our users in order to serve them better. Active data is collected when you interact 
						with our website to customize the tools and services or provide information for services which require us to be able to contact you.  Examples of 
						active data include:
