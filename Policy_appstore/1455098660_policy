Our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains the information we collect,

				and services (collectively, the "Services").
PROTECTION AND CONTROL OF THE DATA
Intelligent Training Group ApS is subject to The General Data Protection
				Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as GDPR), a regulation focused on
				European Union residents and European Economic Area (EEA) residents'
				privacy rights.
In accordance with the Terms and this Privacy Policy, Intelligent Training
				Group ApS uses tools to maintain the safety of your Data when receiving,
				storing and using the Data. We implement appropriate technical and
				organizational safeguards to protect against unauthorized or unlawful
				processing of Personal Data and against accidental or unlawful destruction,
				loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data.
				Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security risks
				associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Data.
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL DATA
This Privacy Policy relates to data about you, your devices, and your
				interaction with our Services.
"
Personal Data
" is information that can be used to
				identify you, directly or indirectly, alone or together with other
				information.
This includes data such as your full name, email address, phone number,
				device IDs, certain cookie and network identifiers (IP-address), debit card
				details and "Fitness and Wellness Data".
Intelligent Cycling Group ApS collects, uses, discloses and processes
				Personal Data as outlined in this Privacy Policy, including to operate and
				improve the Services and our business; for advertising and marketing; and
				to provide you with innovative fitness and wellness services, as further
				described in this Privacy Policy.
Intelligent Training Group ApS may create de-identified or anonymous data
				from Personal Data by excluding data components (such as your name, email
				address, or linkable tracking ID) that makes the data personally
				identifiable to you through obfuscation or other means. Our use of
				anonymized and de-identified data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
HOW WE COLLECT AND USE PERSONAL DATA
Intelligent Training Group ApS collects your Personal Data in a number of
				ways and for various purposes, including:
When you register for an account or interact with our Services.
When you input Fitness and Wellness Data within our Services or use
				our Services that collect or infer such data from mobile device sensors.
When you use or interact with a wearable or other connected device.
When you communicate with us or sign up for promotional materials.
When you participate in special activities, offers, or programs.
When you engage with our online communities or advertising.
When you access third party products and services.

When we link you to friends across platforms.
When you take fitness tests or assessments; share content or
				achievements; or invite friends.
When we comply with Legal Requirements or Obligations, Law
				Enforcement, and for Public Safety Purposes.
When you sign on to our sites or apps using your Facebook login details,
				you give Facebook permission to share your email address and certain
				aspects of your Facebook profile if you have made these public on your
				Facebook profile. This only includes your first and last name, age range,
				link to your Facebook profile and profile picture. We do not have access to
				updates on your Facebook profile.
We will then use this information to form a profile for your Intelligent
				Cycling account. If you remove the Intelligent Cycling app from your
				Facebook, we will no longer have access to this data. However, we will
				still have the information that we received when you first set up your
				Intelligent Cycling account using your Facebook login.
		gin.
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We will only process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do
				so. We determine the legal basis based on the purposes for which we have
				collected and used your personal data. In every case, the legal basis will
				be one of the following:
Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent to receive
				marketing emails from us. You can withdraw your consent at any time. In the
				case of marketing emails, you can withdraw your consent by clicking on the
				"unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email or through your profile
				settings in the "Notification settings" tab when signed into your
				Intelligent Cycling account.
Our legitimate interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand our
				users, promote our services and operate our sites and apps efficiently. For
				example, we will rely on our legitimate interest when we analyze what
				content has been viewed on our sites and apps, so that we can understand
				how they are used. It is also in our legitimate interest to carry out
				marketing analysis to determine what products and services may be relevant
				to the interests of our users.
Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to
				entering into a contract with you): For example, where you have purchased a
				subscription from us, and we need to use your contact details and payment
				information in order to process your order and deliver your subscription.
Compliance with law: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use
				or keep your personal data.
HOW WE STORE YOUR DATA AND DATA RETENTION
Intelligent Training Group ApS securely stores your data via Amazon
				Webhosting (AWS) with servers based in the European Union.
Intelligent Training Group ApS will keep your personal data as long as it
				is necessary for us to deliver our services to you and comply with Danish
				legal requirements and obligations. Once your personal information is no
				longer needed or when you delete your account, we will delete your data.
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
				information via the website or app, your information is protected both
				online and offline.
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that
				information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can
				verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web
				browser or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web
				page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted
				online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need
				the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer
				service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
				computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are
				kept in a secure environment.
