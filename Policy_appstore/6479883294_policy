DATA SECURITY
The Data Controller and the processors are entitled to access the personal data of the data subject only to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks.
The transmission of personal data is carried out by the Data Controller in a uniform, pre-audited and secure manner, by informing the data subject, avoiding redundant data transmission or data transmission through different registration platforms.
In order to ensure data security, the Data Controller shall assess and record all data processing activities it carries out.
On the basis of the records of processing activities, the Data Controller takes into account the conditions under which each processing is carried out and the risk factors that may cause harm or potential data breaches during processing. The assessment of risks should be based on the actual data processing activity that takes place. The purpose of the assessment is to determine the security rules and measures that will ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data appropriate to the performance of the Data Controller's activities.
The Data Controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the GDPR, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the varying degrees of probability and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Including, among others, where appropriate:
the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
securing the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the systems and services used to process personal data;
in the event of a physical or technical incident, the ability to restore access to and availability of personal data in a timely manner;
a procedure to regularly test, assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures taken to ensure the security of processing.
In determining the appropriate level of security, explicit account should be taken of the risks arising from the processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
The Data Controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data that are necessary for the specific purpose of the processing are processed. This obligation relates to the amount of personal data collected, the extent to which it is processed, the duration of its storage and its availability. These measures should in particular ensure that personal data cannot, by default, be made available to an indeterminate number of persons without the intervention of the natural person.
In the event of damage or destruction of personal data, attempts should be made to replace the damaged data as far as possible from other available data sources. The fact that the data have been replaced shall be indicated in the data.
The Data Controller shall protect its internal network with multiple layers of firewall protection. In all cases, hardware firewalls (border protection devices) shall always be installed at the entry points to the public networks used. The Data Controller shall store the data redundantly, i.e. in multiple locations, to protect them from destruction, loss, damage or unlawful destruction due to malfunction of the IT device.
Internal networks are protected from external attacks with multi-layered, active, complex malware protection against harmful codes (e.g. virus protection).
The Data Controller shall take the utmost care to ensure that its IT tools and software continuously comply with the technological solutions generally accepted in the market.
RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT
It is important for the Data Controller that its processing complies with the requirements of fairness, lawfulness and transparency. The data subject may, in connection with the processing, at any time:
request information about the processing and access to the data processed concerning him or her,
request rectification or completion of incomplete data in the event of inaccurate data,
request the erasure of data processed on the basis of the data subject’s consent,
object against the processing of the data subject’s data,
request the restriction of data processing.
On the basis of a request for information, and unless it is restricted by a legitimate interest, the data subject may find out whether their personal data are being processed by the Data Controller and have the right to obtain information about the processing of their personal data, in particular
the purpose of processing,
the entitlement of processing, (legal basis),
when and for how long it processes their data (term),
what data it processes and provides a copy to the data subject,
the recipients of the personal data and the categories of recipients,
transfer to a third country or international organisation,
if not collected from the data subject, the source of the data,
the features of automated decision-making, if such is applied by the data controller,
the data subjects' rights in relation to data processing,
options for remedies.
The Data Controller shall respond to requests for information and access within one month at the latest. The Data Controller may charge a reasonable fee, based on administrative costs, for additional copies of personal data concerning the data subject that are requested.
In the case of a request for rectification (amendment) of data, the data subject shall substantiate the accuracy of the data requested to be amended and shall also certify the person who requests the amendment is authorised to do so. Only in this way can the Data Controller assess whether the new data is real and, if so, whether it can modify the old data.
If it is not clear whether the processed data is correct or accurate, the Data Controller shall not rectify the data, but only flag it, i.e. indicate that the data subject has objected to it, but it may not be incorrect. The data controller shall, without undue delay, rectify inaccurate personal data or supplement the data concerned by the request, after confirming the authenticity of the request. The Data Controller shall notify the data subject of the rectification or flagging.
In the event of a request for erasure or blocking of data, the data subject may request the erasure of their data, which means that the Data Controller shall erase data relating to the data subject without undue delay if:
the personal data have been unlawfully processed
the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were processed,
where the processing was based on the data subject's consent and they have withdrawn it, and no other legal basis justifies the continued processing of the data,
the Data Controller is under a legal obligation to erase the data and has not yet done so.
The data subject may request the restriction of processing, which the data controller will comply with if one of the following conditions is met:
the data subject contests the accuracy of the personal data, in which case the restriction applies for the period of time necessary to allow the data controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data,
the data processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the data and instead requests the restriction of their use,
the data controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but the data subject requests them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, i.e. against the data processing concerning them.
Where the data are subject to restriction, such personal data may be processed, except for storage, only with the consent of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or of an important public interest of the Union or of a Member State. The Data Controller shall inform the data subject in advance of the lifting of the restriction on data processing.
If the data subject considers that the data processing infringes the provisions of the GDPR or the Information Act, or holds that the way in which the Data Controller processes their personal data is injurious, we recommend to first contact the Data Controller with a complaint. All complaints will be investigated.
If, despite its complaint, the data subject still has a grievance about the way the Data Controller processes their data or wishes to contact the authorities directly, they can lodge a complaint with the National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. (address: H-1055 Budapest, Falk Miksa utca 9-11., mailing address: H-1363 Budapest, Pf.: 9. E-mail:
ugyfelszolgalat@naih.hu
, website:

).
To protect their data, the data subject may turn to court, which will rule on the case out of turn. In this case, the data subject is free to choose whether to bring action before the regional court of their domicile (permanent address) or the regional court of their residence (temporary address) (

Annex No. 2
: Terms related to the processing of personal data
data controller: the legal person who determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;
processing: any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;

Annex No. 3
: Identity and details of the data processors, the specific nature of their processing and the guarantees for the transfer of data
Certain data processors used by the Data Controller may be established in or transfer data to the United States of America.
The Data Controller draws attention to the following
risks
in connection with data transfers to the United States of America.
Equivalent protection: The United States of America does not have a comprehensive data protection framework equivalent to that existing in the European Union (including, in particular, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the GPDR) at the time of entry into force of this notice, as defined by the so-called Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 16 July 2020. This may result in data subjects' privacy rights not being adequately protected.
National security and prosecution of crimes: Some authorities in the United States of America have extensive surveillance powers which they can use to access personal data without appropriate legal safeguards.
Data security: A data processor operating in the United States may not have the same level of security measures as a data controller in Hungary, which increases the risk of a data integrity breach.
As the legal basis for the processing, the Data Controller
applies Article 46 (2) (c) of the GDPR, subject to the provisions under recital 104 as well, according to which the transfer is permitted if the general data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission in accordance with the examination committee procedure referred to in Article 93 (2) are used.
As a risk mitigation measure, in order to protect the personal data of the data subjects
, the Data Controller only uses data processors that undertake and ensure compliance with the data processing obligations set out in Article 28 of the GDPR or with which it has concluded a data processing contract in which the data processor has undertaken these obligations.
In this notice, the Data Controller describes to the data subjects the data processing safeguards that ensure the enforcement of the data processing commitments and data subject rights under the GDPR.

Standard Contractual Clauses
– second module: Transfers from the controller to the processor) drafted by the European Commission.
Features of the data transfer
Based on
Shopify Privacy Policy
, we draw your attention to the following special data processing processes and requirements that affect data subjects.
Automated risk and fraud scoring
Shopify uses automated decision-making to use its clients’ personal data to block certain transactions that appear to be fraudulent. Shopify risk and fraud screening may use certain personal data of data subjects for automated decision-making. Shopify does not generally engage in fully automated decision-making with respect to the personal data of data subjects. The only exception is Shopify's risk and fraud screening, where Shopify may automatically block a payment card number or IP address after a certain number of failed payment attempts. This has no significant legal impact on the data subjects, as the automatic blocking only lasts for a short period of time.
As part of providing the Services, Shopify transfers personal data to MaxMind, a fraud detection service that processes the personal data to provide the Data Controller with risk scores to help avoid fraudulent transactions. In this capacity, MaxMind acts as an independent data controller of the personal data it processes. More information about MaxMind's privacy practices can be found here:
www.maxmind.com/en/privacy-policy
.
Parental consent
The GDPR contains specific parental consent requirements for the processing of personal data of users under the age of 16. Under Article 8 of the GDPR, in the case of a child under the age of 16, the processing of personal data of children is lawful only if and to the extent that consent has been given or authorised by the person with parental responsibility over the child.
Data transfer
Your personal data is controlled by Shopify International Ltd, a subsidiary of Shopify in Ireland. The data is then transferred by Shopify to other Shopify locations and service providers located in other regions, including Canada (where Shopify is established) and the United States. Personal data is sent outside Europe in accordance with European law.
