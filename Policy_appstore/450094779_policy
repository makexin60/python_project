Confidentiality + security
FNB has physical, technological and procedural security safeguards in place and will use its best endeavours to protect your personal information.
What is personal information? Personal information refers to information that identifies or relates specifically to you, for example, your name, age and identity number, your assets and liabilities, your income and your payment records. Any information about what you buy, where you shop, where you bank, how you invest and all related information will also be regarded as personal information. In short, any information that we know about you will be regarded as your personal information.

How we collect your info
Whenever you use this website, complete an application form, contact us electronically, or use one of the services or facilities offered by us or any affiliate party, we will collect your personal information.
Close
Why and how we collect and use personal information
To make your use of this website and all products and services offered on this website as successful and pleasurable as possible, it is necessary for us to find out exactly what you need and want from us.
The following are reasons why we would collect your personal information:
To identify you
For us to process your instructions or requests
For us to ensure that we meet your needs, we may collect and analyse your personal information and combine all the information that we have about you to compile a profile of you in order for us to personalise and tailor our services to meet your specific needs
Once we have collected and analysed your personal information, we may send you promotional material or details which we think may be of interest to you. If any of this promotional information relates to products, promotions, news or services of an affiliate party, and if you indicate that you would like more details, we may inform the affiliate party to contact you directly. We will however, only inform an affiliate party to contact you directly if you have indicated that this is agreeable to you.
Your privacy is important to us. We will therefore not sell, rent or provide your personal information to unauthorised entities or other third parties, for their independent use, without your consent.
If at any stage, after you have given us your consent, you no longer wish us to use or share your personal information with an affiliate party; you may at any stage withdraw your consent.
Close
Protection of your personal information
We value the information that you choose to provide us with and will therefore take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorised alteration. The information we maintain concerning our customers is stored in databases that have built-in safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of that information. When you use the services or facilities provided by us, you may be given an access number, user name, password and/or personal identification number (PIN). You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and confidentiality of your user name, access card, password and/or personal identification number ('PIN').
Close
Correction of personal information
If you ever want to update or correct any of your personal information held by us, kindly contact us at the Internet banking helpline on 0860 11 22 44. Alternatively, you can update and correct your information yourself by logging onto Internet Banking. Personal information held by or disclosed by you to a third party. Because we are not responsible for any representations or information or warranties or content on any website of an affiliate party (including websites linked to this website or websites facilitated by us), we do not exercise control over affiliate parties' privacy policies and you should refer to the privacy policy of any such affiliate party to see how such party protects your privacy.

Explaining the jargon
Personal Information (PI) is information that can be used to identify you, like your name, surname and ID number.
Special Personal Information (SPI) is sensitive personal information that can be used to identify you and receives some extra protection in law, like your health.
Both words have specific meaning in terms of South African Law. A juristic person is a company or an entity that has a
separate legal personality from you.
