The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there.

DoubleClick uses, for example, cookies, i.e. small text files that are stored locally in the cache of your web browser on your device. Google uses a cookie ID to record which ads are displayed in which web browser. This can prevent ads from being displayed multiple times. DoubleClick can also use the cookie IDs to record what are known as conversions, which are related to ad requests. This is the case, for example, if you see a DoubleClick ad and later visit the advertiser's website with the same web browser and buy something there. According to Information from Google, the aforementioned cookies do not contain any personal data.
By using DoubleClick, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to Google's server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of DoubleClick. To the best of our knowledge, Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you have a user account with Google and are registered, Google can assign the visit to your user account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a possibility that Google will store your IP address.
We use DoubleClick to display ads that are relevant and interesting to you, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent you from seeing the same ads multiple times.

g)   Facebook Custom Audiences and Facebook Pixel
(a) Nature and purpose of the processing
Within our online offer, the so-called "Facebook pixel" of social network Facebook, Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook") is used for purposes of analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer.
With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine the visitors of our online offer as a target group for the presentation of advertisements ("Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel to display the Facebook ads placed by us only to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our online offer or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products that are determined on the basis of the websites visited) that we communicate to Facebook ("custom audiences"). By using the Facebook pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and are not annoying. The Facebook pixel also allows us to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users have been redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad ("conversion").
The Facebook pixel is integrated by Facebook after your consent has been granted and can store a cookie, i.e. a small file, on your device. If you then log in to Facebook or visit Facebook while logged in, the visit to our website will be noted in your profile. The data collected about you is anonymous to us, so we are unable to draw any conclusions about the identity of the users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook, meaning that an association with the respective user profile is possible and can be used by Facebook as well as for its own market research and advertising purposes. If we transmit data to Facebook for comparative purposes as part of the pixel procedure, it is encrypted locally on the browser and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection. This is done solely for the purposes of establishing a comparison with the data encrypted by Facebook in the same way.

The processing of the data takes place on the basis of the user's consent (Art. 6 paragraph 1 (a) GDPR).

https://www.facebook.com/camping.info/
https://www.instagram.com/camping.info/
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ9JdmK7fuPYl0dPDwbpkrg

https://www.pinterest.de/campinginfo0184/
All of our social media channels can only be accessed by visitors to the website via an external link. Our website does not use any plugins or other interfaces offered by the respective networks for the embedding of the services on websites.
We have no influence over the collection of data and its further use by the social networks. We therefore have no knowledge of the extent, location and duration of the data being stored, the extent to which the networks comply with existing deletion obligations, which evaluations of and associations with the data are undertaken and to whom the data is disclosed. We therefore expressly draw your attention to the fact that the user data (e.g. personal information, IP address) is stored by the operators of the networks in accordance with their data use guidelines and used for business purposes.
We process the data of the users in the social media presences insofar as these users contact us and communicate with us through comments or direct messages, for example.
Legal basis for the processing of the user data is Art. 6 paragraph 1 (b) and (f) GDPR.
a)   Facebook and Instagram
You can access the Facebook and Instagram social media networks via external links on our website. All functions in the social media network are provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland. The channels are only accessible via an external link.

b)   Twitter
(a) Nature and purpose of the processing
Thank you for your interest in our TWITTER presence. We would like to give you an overview of which data is collected, used and stored by us there. Social networks can usually comprehensively analyse your user behaviour when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. "like" buttons or advertising banners). Numerous data protection-relevant processing procedures will be triggered by a visit to our social media presence on Twitter. In detail:
If you are logged in to your Twitter account and visit our social media presence, Twitter can assign this visit to your user account. However, under certain circumstances your personal data may also be collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account on Twitter. In this case, this data collection takes place, for example, via cookies that are stored on your device or by recording your IP address. By using the data collected in this way, Twitter can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored.
This allows interest-based advertising to be displayed to you within and outside of Twitter. If you have a Twitter account, interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or were logged in. Please also note that we cannot track all processing processes on Twitter: it is possible that further processing operations may be carried out by Twitter.

Thank you for your interest in our PINTEREST presence. We would like to give you an overview of which data is collected, used and stored by us there. Social networks can usually comprehensively analyse your user behaviour when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. "like" buttons or advertising banners). Numerous data protection-relevant processing procedures will be triggered by a visit to our social media presence on Pinterest. In detail:
If you are logged in to your Pinterest account and visit our social media presence, Pinterest can assign this visit to your user account. However, under certain circumstances your personal data may also be collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account on Pinterest. In this case, this data collection takes place, for example, via cookies that are stored on your device or by recording your IP address. By using the data collected in this way, Pinterest can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. This allows interest-based advertising to be displayed to you within and outside of Pinterest. If you have a Pinterest account, interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or were logged in. Please also note that we cannot track all processing processes on Pinterest: it is possible that further processing operations may be carried out by Pinterest. For details, please refer to Pinterest's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

III.   User registration/login
Every user has the opportunity – in accordance with our Terms of Use – to create a user account with Camping.info in order to use personalised and/or paid offers and services. For this purpose, the specification of a (valid) email address and the assignment of a password by the user is required. Depending on the design of the respective offer and the services, additional (earmarked) personal information may be required. Moreover, users can add additional personal information and user content to their user account in corresponding form fields – on a voluntary basis and revocable at any time.
This data is processed by us – within the framework of the Terms of Use agreed with you – for the needs-based design of our offers, for product information for advertising, for customer care as well as for the fulfilment of a contract with the data subject or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
Following successful login, you can independently manage the inventory data saved by us. Sensitive data (e.g. passwords) is stored in hashed form on our servers. This means that it is encrypted by a technical process, preventing unauthorised access to this information by third parties.
As part of the registration and each login, Camping.info stores the IP address and the time of the respective user action. The processing of the data takes place on the basis of our Terms of Use pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR, your consent pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (a) GDPR, as well as for the protection of our legitimate interests and those of the user
in preventing misuse and other unauthorised use pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (f) GDPR. This data is passed on to third parties exclusively for the execution of the existing contract with you (see Terms of Use and General Terms and Conditions B2B/B2C) in accordance with Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR, on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (a) GDPR, or for the fulfilment of statutory obligations pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (c) GDPR.
In order to make our market and product analyses as accurate and targeted as possible, we use the identification features of the individual user accounts to link the collected usage data across platforms. In this process, we may transfer your anonymised user data to a data warehouse where it can be collected, modelled and linked to the usage data. We cooperate exclusively with hosts who guarantee particularly high data protection standards and confirm to us their obligation to the regulations resulting from the GDPR in the form of an order processing contract.
The data will be deleted by Camping.info as soon as it is no longer required for achieving the purpose of their processing. Even after the end of the contract, there may be a contractual or legal necessity to store personal data of the contractual partner. In this case, there is no right to deletion, but possibly to restriction of data processing. If you terminate your user account, the data associated with it will be deleted, subject to a statutory retention obligation. The data subject is responsible for backing up their data.
IV. Posting user content
Our portal is primarily used to exchange information about campsites, pitches, campsites and other services for camping-related leisure activities. In compliance with our Terms of Use, registered users have the option (voluntary and revocable at any time) of submitting property-related ratings and posting their own comments as well as images and videos (hereinafter collectively referred to as "User Content"). To the extent you make use of this, you grant us a licence to use the User Content you post to operate and promote the services in accordance with our Terms of Use. In this context, the processing of personal data takes place on the basis of the fulfilment of the contract in accordance with Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR.
If you post User Content, it will be published in connection with the corresponding property, and the username you have provided will be displayed. We publish this User Content on your public profile or on the public profile of the campsite without prior verification. Please note that you are responsible for the protection of copyright and personality rights. In accordance with our terms of use, we reserve the right to block or delete User Content without giving reasons
We calculate an average value from all submitted reviews and publish it, using a rating widget where appropriate, on the campsites' websites. As part of a content sharing programme, we also offer campsite operators the option of displaying the ratings submitted for their campsite on their websites.
We have established various forums to allow our users to exchange information on a variety of topics. You can register for and post on these forums. The posts that you submit will then be made publicly available without having been checked by us. Please note that we do not accept any liability for the content you publish, and the content may be associated with your user profile by us and by visitors to the forums.
The user data you upload is stored on the servers of hosting providers with which we have secured compliance with the provisions arising from the GDPR through the mutual signing of an order processing agreement.
The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for achieving the purpose of its processing. Even after the end of the contract, there may be a contractual or legal necessity to store personal data of the contractual partner. In this case, there is no right to deletion, but possibly to restriction of data processing.
V. Bookings
To book properties and pitches, you will be redirected to the websites of the respective providers. The respective providers are then responsible for the processing of personal data in accordance with Art. 4 (7) GDPR. Please also note in this context the respective data privacy policies that are available on the respective websites of the providers.
VI.    Newsletter
(a) Nature and purpose of the processing
Your data will be used solely to send you the subscribed newsletter by email. Your name is provided in order to be able to address you personally in the newsletter and, if necessary, to identify you in the event that you wish to exercise your rights as a data subject. The provision of your email address is sufficient for the receipt of the newsletter. When registering to receive our newsletter, the data you provide will be used exclusively for this purpose. Subscribers can also be informed by email about circumstances that are relevant for the service or registration (e.g. changes to the newsletter service or technical circumstances). For effective registration, we need a valid email address. We use the "double opt-in" procedure to verify that registration actually is being undertaken by the owner of the email address. To this end, we log the requesting of the newsletter, the sending of a confirmation email and the receipt of the response requested by it. No further data is collected. The data will be used exclusively for sending the newsletter and will not be disclosed to third parties.
We use tools for automatic data collection for certain emails that we send. These tools collect information when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email. We may use this data to adapt the content of the newsletter to your preferences. This personalisation aims to make the content sent to you more interesting for you in order to avoid sending you unnecessary or uninteresting emails.
(b) Legal basis of the processing
On the basis of your expressly granted consent (Art. 6 paragraph 1 (a) GDPR, Art. 7 GDPR in conjunction with Section 6 paragraph 2 TTDSG), we regularly send you our newsletter or comparable information by email to your specified email address.
(c) Data categories
IP address, browser data, time stamp, device data, etc.
(d) Recipients
Recipients of the data are internal employees and MailChimp as the processor.
(e) Storage periods
In this context, the data will only be processed for as long as the corresponding consent is in place. Thereafter, it will be deleted.
(f) Legal / contractual requirement
The provision of your personal data is voluntary, and solely on the basis of your consent. Unfortunately, we cannot send you our newsletter without your consent being given.
(g) Transfer to non-EU countries
Processing may also take place outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA).  In order to guarantee the level of data protection in this non-EU country, we have concluded the standard data privacy clauses with MailChimp.
(h) Revocation of consent
You can revoke your consent to the storage of your personal data and its use for sending the newsletter at any time with effect for the future. Every newsletter contains a link for this purpose. You can also unsubscribe directly at any time via the contact details provided at the end of this Data Privacy Policy.
(i) Automated decision-making and profiling
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling for this data processing.
VII.   Competitions
For the implementation of competitions, we collect contact and, where applicable, address data from all participants. The legal basis for the processing is therefore Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR, since the processing is necessary for the execution of fulfilment of this contractual relationship. We process the personal data of the participants exclusively for the implementation of the competition, in particular to determine whether you are eligible to participate and to determine and notify the winners by email. If you do not provide us with the aforementioned data, participation in the competition and contact regarding a prize notification will not be possible.
Your personal data will be stored exclusively for the implementation of the competition. It will be deleted within 14 days of the end of the competition, unless there are legal obligations to the contrary. Further information on the processing of your personal data can be found in the respective conditions of participation.
VIII.   Joint responsibility (Facebook fan page)
Camping.info operates an online presence on Facebook/Instagram, i.e. a Facebook fan page or Instagram fan page. The following additional information on data processing applies to visits to our fan pages. Information on data privacy at Facebook in general can be found here (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/).
a)    Joint responsibility, contact data, company data protection officers:
In accordance with Art. 26 GDPR, we are jointly responsible with Facebook for the operation of our Facebook fan page. To this end, we have concluded an agreement with Facebook which sets out who fulfils which obligations with regard to data privacy. This agreement can be accessed here (https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum).  Accordingly, Facebook is primarily responsible for providing the data subject with information on the joint processing and for enabling them to exercise their data privacy rights.
Regardless of this, we provide you here with information about your visit to our fan page.
Our contact details are: see above
You can contact Facebook at:
Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland
Online, you can contact Facebook here (https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/2061665240770586) Our data protection officer can be contacted at: see above
Facebook's data protection officer can be contacted at https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/540977946302970
b)    Collection and storage of personal data as well as the type and purpose and its use
(a) Information collected by Facebook
If you are a Facebook user, Facebook collects the data described in the Facebook Data Policy under "What types of information do we collect?". If you are not a Facebook user, cookies with identifiers, small text files, may still be stored in your browser, which enable the tracking of your user behaviour.
The user data collected while visiting Facebook is also used by Facebook for market research and advertising purposes. Based on the user behaviour (including when visiting our fan page), complex user profiles are created that Facebook can use to show the visitor personalised advertisements within and outside of Facebook.
More information on this can also be found in the Facebook Data Policy. If you do not agree with this, you can object here (opt-out).
(b) Data we use ("page insights") and legal basis
Facebook provides us with statistics and usage data which we can use to analyse the use of our fan page ("page insights"). This allows us to continuously improve our presence on Facebook. As the operator, we do not make any decisions regarding the processing of insights data and all other information resulting from Art. 13 GDPR, such as the storage period of cookies on user end devices. The primary responsibility under the GDPR for the processing of insights data lies with Facebook, and Facebook fulfils all obligations under the GDPR with regard to the processing of insights data.
As page administrators, we have no other way, not even through user tracking, to evaluate user behaviour on our fan page. It is also generally not possible for us to identify the visitor to the fan page on the basis of the page insights. In particular, we have no right under the agreement to require Facebook to disclose individual visitor data. Identification is only possible for us if we can associate "Like" information for the page with individual profile pictures;
however, this is only possible if our fan page is "liked" by the visitor in question and the "Like" information is set to "public". Which information Facebook uses to create page insights can be viewed here.
The operation of the Facebook fan page and the use of the page insights serves our legitimate interests in an effective external presence and effective communication with our customers and interested parties. This interest justifies the operation of the page vis-à-vis both the legitimate interests of Facebook users and of visitors to our fan page who do not have a Facebook account. Accordingly, the legal basis is Art. 6 paragraph 1 (f) GDPR.
c)  Disclosure of data to third parties
Data collected by Facebook is exchanged and processed within the entire Facebook Group. The Facebook Group also includes Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, for example. Information collected via Facebook is used, for example, to show the user personalised advertising on Instagram, or information from WhatsApp is used to take action on Facebook against accounts that send spam via WhatsApp. You can find this information in the Facebook Data Policy under "How do the Facebook companies work together?".
When Facebook processes data, user data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), in particular to the USA.
d)  Right to object
If your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 (f) GDPR, you have the right pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR to object to the processing of your personal data, insofar as there are reasons for this arising from your particular situation or if the objection is raised against direct marketing. In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which will be implemented by us without a particular situation being specified. If you want to exercise your right of revocation or objection, an email to kontakt@buglundkollegen.de is sufficient.
e)  Rights of data subjects
You have the right to withdraw your consent from us at any time. As a result, we will no longer be permitted to continue the data processing, with future effect, which was based on consent. You also have the right to information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, the right to rectification pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR, the right to erasure pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR, as well as the right to data portability arising from Art. 21 GDPR. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authorities (Art. 77 GDPR).
In principle, you can assert your rights as a data subject against both Facebook and us. Since only Facebook has direct access to your user data, you can most effectively assert your rights as a data subject against Facebook.
B.  Your rights as a data subject
You have the following rights vis-à-vis us with regard to the personal data concerning you:
Right of information, Art. 15 GDPR
Right to rectification, Art. 16 GDPR
Right to deletion, Art. 17 GDPR
Right to restriction of the processing, Art. 18 GDPR
Right to data portability, Art. 20 GDPR
Right to object to the processing, Art. 21 GDPR
Insofar as you have granted us consent in accordance with Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (a) GDPR, you have the right to revoke it at any time. Revocation does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of your consent up until receipt of the revocation.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority concerning the processing of your personal data by us.
The competent supervisory authority in matters of data privacy can be found under the following link.
