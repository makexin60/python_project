The apps on this platform help you learn and practice languages.
Find conjugations in one of five languages, create lists of the most difficult verbs
and practice them with different exercises using
VerbForms.
Practice your language writing skills and listening comprehension via a traditional dictation using
dictado
. It recognizes and reads out, sentence by sentence, over 25 different languages.
We hope you enjoy learning languages with the apps of Lexiforms.
This is the easiest way!
