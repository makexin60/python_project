LEGAL BASES FOR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
Some countries require that companies only process your “Personal Data” (as that term is defined in such applicable laws) if they have a “legal basis” (or justifiable need) for processing your Personal Data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal bases for processing Personal Data are as follows:
Where your Personal Data is necessary to perform our obligations pursuant to a contract (or pending contract) with you. For example, we will process your Personal Data to comply with our
Terms of Service
to enter into a contract with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.
Where your Personal Data is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. For example, we will process your Personal Data to operate our business and our Services; identify and fix any issues with our Services; provide security for our Services; learn more about how our customers use the Services; perform internal analytics and research concerning the Services; improve the Services and users’ experiences with the Services; test and create new Services; provide you with information about new products, special offers or other information that we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided; ensure safe environments for our employees; make and receive payments; comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; prevent fraud; and to know the customer to whom we are providing Services.
Where use of your Personal Data is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we will process your Personal Data to comply with tax and employment laws.
Where we have your consent. For example, where a country requires that we obtain your consent before we process certain data, we will seek your consent in accordance with those countries’ requirements.
COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
To collect the information in the “Information We Automatically Collect” section above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences.
A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, and it enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions.
Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email that are designed to: (i) collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates; (ii) measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising; and (iii) access user cookies.
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g.,
Internet Explorer
;
Google Chrome
;
Mozilla Firefox
; or
Apple Safari
). Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.
For more information about how we use cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING
Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by
clicking here
.
If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as tracking pixels, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
Online Advertising
The Services may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Display Network, Criteo, and others) to place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you to assist in the delivery of relevant advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other services you use. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
We also sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile apps.
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link
, the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link
, or
Your Online Choices
to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the
Google Ads Settings page
. Please note that these opt-outs apply per device, so you will have to opt-out for each device through which you access our Services.
For additional ways to out of targeted advertising activities under applicable law, see the "Your Privacy Rights Regarding Your Information" section below.
Notice Concerning Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about
Do Not Track
.
Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the legally-required user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Privacy Rights Regarding Your Information” section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.
HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
We and our service providers will disclose the information we collect from and about you for the following business and operational purposes:
Service Providers.
We provide access to or disclose your information to select third parties who perform services on our behalf, such as sales, marketing, product content and features, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, delivery, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing and order fulfillment (e.g., Shopify), and legal services.
Affiliates and Subsidiaries.
We provide access to or disclose your information to current or future affiliates and subsidiaries for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Protection of Ember and Others.
By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and disclose the information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with law or legal process (e.g., a subpoena or court order); (ii) enforce our
Terms of Service
, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Ember, its agents and affiliates, its users, and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.
Business Transfers.
As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions (including in contemplation of such transactions), user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Ember will comply with such restrictions.
Your Consent.
If you have consented to our disclosure of your information, we will also disclose your information consistent with your consent.
From time to time, Ember may disclose aggregate or anonymous information about use of the Services, such as by publishing a report on usage trends. We may disclose such aggregate or anonymous information with any third party, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors.
RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.
THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND FEATURES
The Services contain links to third-party websites, third-party plug-ins (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Twitter), or allow you to integrate with third-party services and apps (e.g., Apple Inc.’s Health app). If you choose to use these websites, plug-ins, or services, you may disclose your information not just to those third parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Similarly, if you use a third-party app that works in connection with your Ember product, you acknowledge that information may be disclosed to the third-party app during the connection that is necessary for the connection to function (e.g., information about how you use your Ember product). If you choose to use these services and initiate these connections, Ember is not responsible for the content or practices of such third-party websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third parties.

Such third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of Services to you, the processing of transactions, and/or the provision of support services. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage, or use.
If you live in the EEA, please note that, if we provide any information about you to any non-EEA Ember affiliates or subsidiaries or third-party information processors, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You are responsible for keeping your account information—and especially your login information—confidential. We ask you not to provide your login credentials to anyone.

They also use cookies and other means of collecting information, but such information is used only for analytics purposes and to enable you to complete your application. Any information that Ember collects from Greenhouse in connection with your application for employment at Ember is handled consistent with this Privacy Policy. Ember will use and disclose your information only for employment purposes, such as evaluating you for a job opportunity or communicating with you about your interests, and where disclosure is required by law.

Ember® California Privacy Notice (Updated)
California Privacy Notice
If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information. Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.
We “share” information to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services.

ur use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.  The following chart details our practices in this regard.
