Redressal Mechanisms.
If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Check Point US in the DPF Frameworks, we encourage you to contact us. For any complaints related to the DPF Frameworks that Check Point US cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, the UK Information Commissioner (for UK individuals), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.

Additional Rights Under the DPF Principles.
Check Point US acknowledges the right of EU, EEA, U.K. (and Gibraltar), and Swiss individuals to request access to their data while it is in the U.S. and to correct, amend, and supplement inaccurate or incomplete data.

here
and request: (i) To opt-out of the disclosure of relevant Personal Information to third parties; (ii) To opt-out of our processing of Personal Information for materially different purposes from those which it was originally collected for.

6.	INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA
6.1.	ZoneAlarm is a global business. Our customers and our operations are spread around the world. As a result, we collect and transfer Personal Data on a global basis. That means that we may transfer your Personal

6.2.
Europe
.
Where we transfer your Personal Data to another country outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), we will ensure that it is protected and transferred in a manner consistent with legal
                            requirements. In relation to data being transferred outside of Europe or the UK, for example, this may be done in one of the following ways:
the country that we send the data to, might be approved by the European Commission as offering an adequate level of protection for Personal Data (for example, Israel is an approved country);
the recipient might have signed a contract based on applicable “model contractual clauses” approved by the European Commission, obliging them to protect your Personal Data; or
in other circumstances the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA or UK.
You can obtain more details of the protection given to your Personal Data when it is transferred outside the EEA or the UK (including a copy of the standard data protection clauses
                            which we have entered into with recipients of your Personal Data) by contacting us as described in paragraph 13 below.
6.3.

. For residents in the mainland of the People’s Republic of China (“Mainland China”), we may transfer, access or store your Personal Data outside of the Mainland China
                            where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect the integrity and security of your Personal Data or adequate security measures are adopted and in compliance
                            with the applicable laws, such as contractual arrangements. Where required by applicable laws, we will put in place appropriate measures to ensure that all processing of your Personal Data
                            outside of the Mainland China is safeguarded by the equivalent level of data protection in the Mainland China.
