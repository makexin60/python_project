Patrick and his team performed flawlessly. Very happy with the premium domain name we bought and the price we paid for it. People who complain about this company do not understand that a company is only responsible for the services it describes and commits to. HugeDomains can and should be trusted as a major player in the domain sales market.

Easy and efficient. Was worried about all of the bad reviews...we experienced none of that. If you need a site they have I would recommend without hesitation. They had the site we needed and bought it. Perfect...end of story.

Process went smooth, although the domain price was higher than the market value. Also got in touch with the Support team and they were helpful. All in all, nothing to complain about reg. buying process or technical support.

How do I keep my personal information private?
If you wish the domain ownership information to be private, add WhoIs Privacy Protection to your domain. This hides your personal information from the general public.
To add privacy protection to your domain, do so within your registrar account. NameBright offers WhoIs Privacy Protection for free for the first year, and then for a small fee for subsequent years.
Whois information is not updated immediately. It typically takes several hours for Whois data to update, and different registrars are faster than others. Usually your Whois information will be fully updated within two days.
