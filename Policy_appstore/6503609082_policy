Answers for Common Questions
What is BlockDAG Network (BDAG)?
BlockDAG, inspired by the efforts of Bitcoin, is a state-of-the-art cryptocurrency that plans to make mobile mining accessible for all. With a go-to-market strategy, our goal is to advance the crypto industry by blending the best of existing blockchain technologies with groundbreaking speed, flexibility, and innovation.
Is crypto mining profitable?
Crypto mining is very profitable, especially in 2024. With BlockDAG’s mobile mining app, users can easily mine BDAG coins at the convenience of their homes. They also offer X Series mining machine variants, from which you can mine from 20 to 2,000 BDAG’s per day.
Where can I get more technical details about the BlockDAG?
For an in-depth exploration of BlockDAG’s technical aspects, refer to the 'BlockDAG Technical Blueprint' in our DAGpaper v1. This section offers a detailed analysis of consensus mechanisms, cryptographic breakthroughs, scalability strategies, smart contract capabilities, tokenomics, and the network's governance model.
How do I activate the miner?
Connect your ASIC miners to reliable power supplies. The stability of your setup is critical for efficient mining operations.
How to Link Miners to the Network?
Link the ASIC miners to your router or switch using Ethernet cables. ASIC miners typically lack Wi-Fi connectivity for enhanced reliability during mining.
How to Assign IP Addresses?
Access your router's interface from a computer within the same network to identify the IPs allocated to each ASIC miner. For streamlined monitoring, consider assigning static local IPs through your router’s settings.
How to Access Configuration?
Enter the identified IP addresses of your ASIC miners into your web browser's address bar. This action should prompt a login page, typically accessible using default credentials provided in the manufacturer's manual.
How to set up configuration for a mining pool?
Navigate to the ASIC miner's control panel and access the mining pool configuration page. Follow the guidelines from your chosen mining pool to input the correct Protocol, Address, and Username/Address details to link your miners to the pool.
How to Prepare, Configure, and Start Mining?
Once configurations are set, your ASIC miner should be primed for mining. Check the miner’s control panel, usually featuring a mining status page to verify readiness.
How do I claim rewards?
Mining pools will direct your earned BDAG coins to the specified wallet address provided during configuration.
How to set up monitoring?
Consider configuring an external computer to act as a monitoring tool for your miners. Numerous solutions exist, so it's beneficial to join a mining community to select a widely used monitoring tool for efficient oversight.
Why is the six-month timeline from presale to mainnet launch significant?
