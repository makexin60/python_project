                    family members
                    or find your mobile phone), within the necessary scope, ZTE may collect the data of the actual
                    location
                    of your mobile device to track your whereabouts and provide the related function. If you do not

                    measures to retain your personal data in a secure manner.
ZTE takes appropriate physical, management, and technical measures, such as the establishment of
                    the access control system and monitoring system, encryption, anonymization or pseudonymization, and
                    employee training to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
                    modification, damage, loss, or other forms of illegal processing. We have also developed a Business
                    Continuity Plan (BCM) system to ensure business continuity. Our information security policies and
                    procedures are designed in strict accordance with the international standards, and are reviewed and
                    updated regularly. In addition, we invite third-parties to inspect our security measures to ensure
                    that they meet the requirements for our business, technical changes, and supervision. ZTE
                    headquarters in China and some of its subsidiaries have passed the ISO 27001 information security
                    certification, and can effectively protect your personal data. ZTE terminal products, 5G products,
                    core network products, digital technology products and human resource system have passed the ISO

                    products indicate that ZTE is capable of providing global customers with secure and reliable 5G
                    products and solutions that comply with relevant requirements, and delivering high-quality 5G
                    networks.
ZTE retains your personal data only for the shortest time necessary for realizing the purposes
                    stated in this Policy, and delete your personal data in a timely manner without violating the
                    applicable laws and regulations upon completion of the relevant business. The data retention period
                    may vary in different scenarios, and for different products and services. ZTE uses the following
                    standards to determine the retention period:

4. How We Share, Transfer, and Disclose Your Personal Data
4.1 As a global company, ZTE may share your personal data inside the company if it is necessary to
                    provide services in a timely manner. We will not share your personal data with other companies,
                    organizations or individuals, except in the following cases:
1) Such sharing is necessary for us to fulfill legal obligations or responsibilities;
2) Such sharing is necessary for the conclusion and performance of your contract as a party;
3) Such sharing is intended to protect the health of natural persons and the safety of their
                    property in
                    case of public health emergencies, or other emergencies.
4.2 ZTE may also share necessary personal data with our business partners in accordance with the
                    principle of minimization to provide the related services. We will require our business partners to
                    strictly comply with our measures and requirements for data privacy protection to ensure your
                    privacy security. If an authorized partner needs to use your personal data for an unauthorized
                    purpose, it will seek your prior consent.
4.3 If personal data transfer is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation, asset
                    transfer, and other similar transactions, ZTE will require the new companies, organizations, or
                    individuals that will hold your personal data to continue complying with the requirements of this
                    Policy, and inform you of the identity and the contact information of the recipient in a timely
                    manner. If any new company, organization, or individual refuses to observe the requirements, we will
                    require these companies or organizations to seek your prior consent.
ZTE signs strict data processing agreements with the companies, organizations, and individuals with
                    which we share personal data, and requires them to process your personal data in accordance with our
                    security standards, this Policy, and other relevant confidentiality and security measures.
If the country where the companies, organizations, and individuals with which we share, transfer or
                    disclose your personal data are located does not have the data protection laws that have the same
                    level of protection as the ones in the country where you are located (for instance, your personal
                    data is transferred from the European Economic Area to a country that has no applicable data
                    protection law), we will handle the related issues in accordance with Article 7 of this Policy to
                    guarantee the legitimate transfer and security of your personal data.
5. Your rights
You have various legal rights regarding the personal data ZTE processes. These rights may vary in
                    different countries or regions, but mainly include the following:
1) Know how ZTE processes your personal data and accesses the personal data we store;
2) Object to or restrict our processing of your personal data in special cases. Even if you object
                    to or restrict our processing of your personal data, ZTE is still obliged to continue processing

                    and regulations;
3) Correct the incomplete or inaccurate personal data about you that ZTE stores;

6) In some cases, obtain your personal data in a structured, generic, machine-readable format
                    and/or require us to transfer the data to a technically feasible third party. This right is only
                    applicable to the personal data you provide.
7) Lodge complaints to the related regulators if there is any objection to our personal data
                    processing activities or this Policy.
The way in which you exercise rights depends on the specific product or service you use. In
                    addition, you may contact the Data Protection Compliance Dept. directly by visiting the
Data subject rights response notice
page.
                    ZTE will ensure the security of your personal data when you exercise the rights.

                    verify your identity to ensure the security of your personal data. We do not charge for requests,
                    except for extra requirements. For any questions about accessing and managing personal data, please
                    contact us through the channels provided in Article 10 of this Policy.

Our web pages and specific products or services use cookies, website beacons, and other similar
                    technologies
                    to provide better experience and to improve our products or services. Separate cookie policies are
                    formulated
                    for our websites and specific products. If you want to learn more about information such as security
                    of cookies, please refer to the

7. Cross-Border Transfers of Your Personal Data
ZTE is a global company. We usually process your personal data in the country or region where we
                    provide
                    you with our products or services. However, we may also transfer your personal data to other
                    countries
                    or regions that have different laws on the protection of personal data.
Wherever ZTE may transfer your personal data, we will, pursuant to applicable laws, take every
                    reasonable
                    and necessary measure to ensure your data security, inform you of the destination, recipient, and
                    other
                    related information in a timely manner, and take appropriate measures to comply with this Policy and
                    applicable local laws. For instance, to transfer your personal data, we will seek prior consent or
                    sign
                    a necessary data transfer contract with the receiver.
8. How We Protect Children's Personal Data
ZTE attaches great importance to the protection of minors' personal data. In accordance with
                    relevant laws
                    and regulations, if you are a minor under the age of 18, you shall obtain the consent of your
                    parents
                    or legal guardians before using our services or products.
If you are a child under the age of 14, you shall obtain the consent of your parents or legal
                    guardians
                    before using related products or services, and complete the product or service registration process
                    under
                    the help of your parents or legal guardians, so that you may use the products or services provided
                    by
                    ZTE.
ZTE will not collect personal data from children under the age of 14 without the prior consent of
                    their
                    parents or guardians.
If children's personal data is collected with the prior consent of their parents or guardians, we
                    will
                    only use or disclose such data as permitted by laws, and with the explicit consent of the children's
                    parents or guardians.
If we accidentally collect a child's personal data without the prior consent from the child's
                    parents or
                    guardians, the data will be deleted as soon as possible.

We firmly believe that privacy protection should be incorporated into product design.
We resolutely implement Privacy by Design throughout the product R&D process.

Scenario-based permission setting
Private Space

Sensitive Operation Prompt and Recording
Get all sensitive operations under control
When an app requests to access the location, microphone, or camera of the device, a prompt icon will
                      be displayed in the status bar, and the sensitive permissions used by an app will also be recorded
                      by the system.
Private Data Replacement
Guard against illegal data collection
This service, once enabled, will replace sensitive data with null when an app requests to access information
                      such as contacts, call records, text messages, and schedule, or services including camera and microphone.
Sensitive Permission Control
Scenario-based permission setting
When an app requests to access the camera, microphone, or location of the device, you can choose to allow
                      the access only for once or only while using the app, to limit the app's access of such permissions
                      and reduce the frequency of data reading.
Private Space
A secure space for important data
Important data such as photos, videos, and documents are encrypted and stored in an independent space.
                      It is accessible only via a password specially set by yourself or fingerprint/face recognition. Any
                      unauthorized access from third parties and persons is not allowed.
Approximate Location
Effective protection of your location data
When an app requests to access your location, you can choose to provide the precise or approximate location
                      information. Providing approximate location helps to protect your privacy information.
Clipboard Data Protection
Authorization for information copying
The clipboard may contain privacy information. When an app requests to access the clipboard without a
                      permission, the system will prompt a dialog box to ask for your authorization, ensuring that the clipboard
                      contents will not be illegally obtained.
Photo Protection
We cherish your memories
The photo protection function effectively prevents your photos from being accidentally deleted by third-party
                      apps. If a third-party app tries to delete the photos in the system album, the system will intercept
                      it and report it to you.
App Lock
Protection with dual safeguards
For apps that contain sensitive personal data, you can set an app lock with a specially set password
                      or with fingerprint/face recognition.
System Security
Screen Lock Password
Authentication safeguards
Password-based authentication for unlocking the screen can effectively prevent unauthorized use of your
                      device and the subsequent financial loss or data breaches.
Biometric Identification
User-defined, faster and more secure
ZTE mobile phones are equipped with fingerprint/face recognition for identity verification, enabling
                      quick authentication in encryption/decryption scenarios such as unlocking the screen and making payment.
Virus Scan
Guardian of your device
Your device can be set to conduct regular virus scans to protect system security, thus avoiding mobile
                      traffic anomalies, financial loss, and privacy breaches caused by malicious apps.
Anti-Fraud Center
System-level privacy protection
The built-in anti-fraud center identifies and gives warnings of phone calls, websites, and apps that
                      may involve frauds, thereby preventing financial loss and private data breaches caused by frauds.
Spam Blocker
Diverse blocking methods
You can set multiple rules to block spam calls or text messages, which effectively avoids excessive interruptions,
                      and prevent financial loss and private data breaches caused by ads and other kinds of frauds.
WLAN Security Scan
Hotspot security at a glance
Security scans are carried out on hotspots to join to avoid financial loss or private data breaches caused
                      by unsecure connections.
Secure Keyboard Entry
Enhanced protection of important data
When you enter a password, the system turns on the secure keyboard automatically. With neither text prediction
                      or memory function, nor network access permissions, the secure keyboard does not collect password data,
                      preventing password data breaches.
App Security Scan
Security from the very beginning
The system scans any apps downloaded not from the App Center during the installation to identify potential
                      illegal sources, frauds, and viruses, and informs you the permissions requested by the app.

                    the access control system and monitoring system, encryption, anonymization or pseudonymization, and
                    employee training to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
                    modification, damage, loss, or other forms of illegal processing. We have also developed a Business
                    Continuity Plan (BCM) system to ensure business continuity. Our information security policies and
                    procedures are designed in strict accordance with the international standards, and are reviewed and
                    updated regularly. In addition, we invite third-parties to inspect our security measures to ensure
                    that they meet the requirements for our business, technical changes, and supervision. ZTE
                    headquarters in China and some of its subsidiaries have passed the ISO 27001 information security
                    certification, and can effectively protect your personal data. ZTE terminal products, 5G products,

                    products and solutions that comply with relevant requirements, and delivering high-quality 5G
                    networks.

                    may vary in different scenarios, and for different products and services. ZTE uses the following
                    standards to determine the retention period:

4. How We Share, Transfer, and Disclose Your Personal Data
4.1 As a global company, ZTE may share your personal data inside the company if it is necessary to
                    provide services in a timely manner. We will not share your personal data with other companies,
                    organizations or individuals, except in the following cases:
1) Such sharing is necessary for us to fulfill legal obligations or responsibilities;
2) Such sharing is necessary for the conclusion and performance of your contract as a party;
3) Such sharing is intended to protect the health of natural persons and the safety of their
                    property in
                    case of public health emergencies, or other emergencies.
4.2 ZTE may also share necessary personal data with our business partners in accordance with the
                    principle of minimization to provide the related services. We will require our business partners to
                    strictly comply with our measures and requirements for data privacy protection to ensure your
                    privacy security. If an authorized partner needs to use your personal data for an unauthorized
                    purpose, it will seek your prior consent.
4.3 If personal data transfer is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation, asset
                    transfer, and other similar transactions, ZTE will require the new companies, organizations, or
                    individuals that will hold your personal data to continue complying with the requirements of this
                    Policy, and inform you of the identity and the contact information of the recipient in a timely
                    manner. If any new company, organization, or individual refuses to observe the requirements, we will
                    require these companies or organizations to seek your prior consent.
ZTE signs strict data processing agreements with the companies, organizations, and individuals with
                    which we share personal data, and requires them to process your personal data in accordance with our
                    security standards, this Policy, and other relevant confidentiality and security measures.
If the country where the companies, organizations, and individuals with which we share, transfer or
                    disclose your personal data are located does not have the data protection laws that have the same
                    level of protection as the ones in the country where you are located (for instance, your personal
                    data is transferred from the European Economic Area to a country that has no applicable data
                    protection law), we will handle the related issues in accordance with Article 7 of this Policy to
                    guarantee the legitimate transfer and security of your personal data.
5. Your rights

2) Object to or restrict our processing of your personal data in special cases. Even if you object

6) In some cases, obtain your personal data in a structured, generic, machine-readable format
                    and/or require us to transfer the data to a technically feasible third party. This right is only
                    applicable to the personal data you provide.
7) Lodge complaints to the related regulators if there is any objection to our personal data
                    processing activities or this Policy.
The way in which you exercise rights depends on the specific product or service you use. In
                    addition, you may contact the Data Protection Compliance Dept. directly by visiting the
Data subject rights response notice
page.

                    technologies

                    formulated

                    of cookies, please refer to the

7. Cross-Border Transfers of Your Personal Data
ZTE is a global company. We usually process your personal data in the country or region where we
                    provide
                    you with our products or services. However, we may also transfer your personal data to other
                    countries
                    or regions that have different laws on the protection of personal data.
Wherever ZTE may transfer your personal data, we will, pursuant to applicable laws, take every
                    reasonable
                    and necessary measure to ensure your data security, inform you of the destination, recipient, and
                    other
                    related information in a timely manner, and take appropriate measures to comply with this Policy and
                    applicable local laws. For instance, to transfer your personal data, we will seek prior consent or
                    sign
                    a necessary data transfer contract with the receiver.
8. How We Protect Children's Personal Data
ZTE attaches great importance to the protection of minors' personal data. In accordance with
                    relevant laws
                    and regulations, if you are a minor under the age of 18, you shall obtain the consent of your
                    parents
                    or legal guardians before using our services or products.
If you are a child under the age of 14, you shall obtain the consent of your parents or legal

                    by

                    their

                    will
                    only use or disclose such data as permitted by laws, and with the explicit consent of the children's
                    parents or guardians.
If we accidentally collect a child's personal data without the prior consent from the child's
                    parents or
                    guardians, the data will be deleted as soon as possible.

The name, telephone number, email address, device-related data, fault descriptions and other
                    personal
                    data that you submit when using our customer services or after-sales services;
To implement related functions of some of services, you may need to provide specific personal
                    data. If
                    you opt not to provide such personal data, other functions of the product or service will not be
                    affected.
1.2 Data obtained when you use our products or services
1.2.1 Log data
When you use Location Based Services (LBS) (for example, use our service or product to locate
                    family members
                    or find your mobile phone), within the necessary scope, ZTE may collect the data of the actual
                    location
                    of your mobile device to track your whereabouts and provide the related function. If you do not
                    provide
                    such data, the function may not work properly.
1.2.2 Location data
When you use Location Based Services (LBS) (for example, use our service or product to locate
                    family members
                    or find your mobile phone), within the necessary scope, ZTE may collect the data of the actual
                    location
                    of your mobile device to track your whereabouts and provide the related function. If you do not

                    will
                    record some of your personal data when you access ZTE products or services through the information
                    collection
                    function of the products or websites. If you do not provide such data, the customized products or

                    or share when using the services of a third-party partner. For example, when you use a third-party
                    account (such as Facebook, Twitter, or WeChat account) to log in to a service platform of ZTE, we
                    will obtain the above authentication data from the third party. Your access tokens provided by third
                    parties will be saved on our servers, and such access tokens can be shared among various services

For any of our products or services, if ZTE collects sensitive personal data, the company will
                    process the data in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, for example, by asking your

                    will seek your consent in advance when you use such products or services. You may decide whether to
                    give consent to such changes.

3. How We Protect and Retain your Personal Data
ZTE strictly abides by the "storage limitation", "data minimization", and "accuracy" principles
                    for personal data protection. For the retention of personal data, ZTE takes appropriate security
                    measures to retain your personal data in a secure manner.
ZTE takes appropriate physical, management, and technical measures, such as the establishment of
                    the access control system and monitoring system, encryption, anonymization or pseudonymization, and
                    employee training to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
                    modification, damage, loss, or other forms of illegal processing. We have also developed a Business
                    Continuity Plan (BCM) system to ensure business continuity. Our information security policies and
                    procedures are designed in strict accordance with the international standards, and are reviewed and
                    updated regularly. In addition, we invite third-parties to inspect our security measures to ensure
                    that they meet the requirements for our business, technical changes, and supervision. ZTE
                    headquarters in China and some of its subsidiaries have passed the ISO 27001 information security
                    certification, and can effectively protect your personal data. ZTE terminal products, 5G products,
                    core network products, digital technology products and human resource system have passed the ISO
                    27701 certification. As the world's first 5G products that pass the ISO 27701 certification, our 5G
                    products indicate that ZTE is capable of providing global customers with secure and reliable 5G
                    products and solutions that comply with relevant requirements, and delivering high-quality 5G
                    networks.
ZTE retains your personal data only for the shortest time necessary for realizing the purposes
                    stated in this Policy, and delete your personal data in a timely manner without violating the
                    applicable laws and regulations upon completion of the relevant business. The data retention period
                    may vary in different scenarios, and for different products and services. ZTE uses the following
                    standards to determine the retention period:
1) Special requirements of the relevant laws and regulations in a specific field;
2) The time required to achieve data processing purposes in business activities;
3) The needs to carry out business activities or the duration of the cooperation between ZTE and
                    the data
                    subjects;
4) The products and services being provided;
5) Maintenance of the corresponding transaction and business records;
6) Implementation of related service agreements or this Policy;
7) Safeguarding of public interests;
8) Guarantee of personal or property safety or other legal rights of our customers, affiliates,
                    other users, and employees.

                    laws and regulations, and take proper measures to ensure the data security.
4. How We Share, Transfer, and Disclose Your Personal Data
4.1 As a global company, ZTE may share your personal data inside the company if it is necessary to
                    provide services in a timely manner. We will not share your personal data with other companies,
                    organizations or individuals, except in the following cases:
1) Such sharing is necessary for us to fulfill legal obligations or responsibilities;
2) Such sharing is necessary for the conclusion and performance of your contract as a party;
3) Such sharing is intended to protect the health of natural persons and the safety of their
                    property in
                    case of public health emergencies, or other emergencies.
4.2 ZTE may also share necessary personal data with our business partners in accordance with the
                    principle of minimization to provide the related services. We will require our business partners to
                    strictly comply with our measures and requirements for data privacy protection to ensure your
                    privacy security. If an authorized partner needs to use your personal data for an unauthorized
                    purpose, it will seek your prior consent.
4.3 If personal data transfer is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation, asset
                    transfer, and other similar transactions, ZTE will require the new companies, organizations, or
                    individuals that will hold your personal data to continue complying with the requirements of this
                    Policy, and inform you of the identity and the contact information of the recipient in a timely
                    manner. If any new company, organization, or individual refuses to observe the requirements, we will
                    require these companies or organizations to seek your prior consent.
ZTE signs strict data processing agreements with the companies, organizations, and individuals with
                    which we share personal data, and requires them to process your personal data in accordance with our
                    security standards, this Policy, and other relevant confidentiality and security measures.
If the country where the companies, organizations, and individuals with which we share, transfer or
                    disclose your personal data are located does not have the data protection laws that have the same
                    level of protection as the ones in the country where you are located (for instance, your personal
                    data is transferred from the European Economic Area to a country that has no applicable data
                    protection law), we will handle the related issues in accordance with Article 7 of this Policy to
                    guarantee the legitimate transfer and security of your personal data.
5. Your rights
You have various legal rights regarding the personal data ZTE processes. These rights may vary in
                    different countries or regions, but mainly include the following:
1) Know how ZTE processes your personal data and accesses the personal data we store;
2) Object to or restrict our processing of your personal data in special cases. Even if you object
                    to or restrict our processing of your personal data, ZTE is still obliged to continue processing
                    your personal data and reject your request where it is explicitly required under the applicable laws
                    and regulations;
3) Correct the incomplete or inaccurate personal data about you that ZTE stores;
4) Query or copy your personal data;
5) Delete your personal data. Please note that where it is required by laws, ZTE is obliged to
                    retain your personal data even if you require us to delete it;
6) In some cases, obtain your personal data in a structured, generic, machine-readable format
                    and/or require us to transfer the data to a technically feasible third party. This right is only
                    applicable to the personal data you provide.
7) Lodge complaints to the related regulators if there is any objection to our personal data
                    processing activities or this Policy.
The way in which you exercise rights depends on the specific product or service you use. In
                    addition, you may contact the Data Protection Compliance Dept. directly by visiting the
Data subject rights response notice
page.
                    ZTE will ensure the security of your personal data when you exercise the rights.

                    formulated

                    of cookies, please refer to the

7. Cross-Border Transfers of Your Personal Data
ZTE is a global company. We usually process your personal data in the country or region where we
                    provide
                    you with our products or services. However, we may also transfer your personal data to other
                    countries
                    or regions that have different laws on the protection of personal data.
Wherever ZTE may transfer your personal data, we will, pursuant to applicable laws, take every
                    reasonable
                    and necessary measure to ensure your data security, inform you of the destination, recipient, and
                    other
                    related information in a timely manner, and take appropriate measures to comply with this Policy and
                    applicable local laws. For instance, to transfer your personal data, we will seek prior consent or
                    sign

                    and regulations, if you are a minor under the age of 18, you shall obtain the consent of your
                    parents
                    or legal guardians before using our services or products.
If you are a child under the age of 14, you shall obtain the consent of your parents or legal
                    guardians
                    before using related products or services, and complete the product or service registration process

                    parents or guardians.
If we accidentally collect a child's personal data without the prior consent from the child's
                    parents or
                    guardians, the data will be deleted as soon as possible.
