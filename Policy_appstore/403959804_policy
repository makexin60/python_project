WHO AM I
I'm Josh Steinberg.  I do hospital, clinic, and labor & delivery for families of patients across the lifespan.  I'm an old-fashioned full-spectrum family doctor but with a new-fangled twist.  I know that a doctor can't possibly know everything needed for every patient in every circumstance, so one has to surround onesself with accurate evidence-based sources of quick information.  In addition to knowing lots of good point-of-care apps from others, I've made myself just barely enough of a programmer to make my own.  Occasionally I reach out to programming collaborators noted below.  All my medical apps are free.  I'm always looking for feedback.  Use the contact email below to send me some.
