What
personal data is processed and the legal basis for processing
There are
different types of information we obtain, whether directly from you or
automatically via your device when you use the App. Essentially, we only obtain
what is strictly necessary to provide you with our services, no more, no less.
Information,
relating to you or your device, is either identified automatically by Our systems,
provided to Us by the operating system of your device or is input by you
manually when filling out certain fields, authorizing certain actions in the
Apps.
Information you
  provide Us with
:
Legal basis for processing
1.
Email address when you log in to use the App
  as a registered user.
Performance
  of the contract with you.
Unless you
  sign up via other means (SNS, see below), We could not provide you with our
  services as a logged in user other than through some means of unique
  identification.
We may contact
  you for marketing purposes of similar products and/or services. It will be in
  Our legitimate interests to do so, but you will always have a chance to opt
  out of such marketing communications prior to any such communication and
  every time thereafter.
We will
  store just enough information to
honour
your
opt-out preference in the future.
2.
Social Network information via the “OAuth”
  method for secure login (read more about OAuth by following the link
https://oauth.net/
)
Essentially,
  this is information from your public profile (with, for instance, Facebook) that
  you can control at any stage.
We do
  not have access to your password which is hashed.
Performance
  of the contract with you.
Same as
  above,
We
could not otherwise provide you with our
  services as a registered user.
3.
History of your workouts when using the App,
  your age, gender, height, weight and body measurements (which you input
  yourself and are both free to delete at any time or amend as required).
Performance
  of the contract with you.
You could
  not otherwise conveniently track your progress and history.
4.
Messages and communication with support
Performance
  of contract to respond to your queries and provide customer support. We do
  not use this information for anything else (for instance, we do not build
  your profile or target you based on your communication with us or with other
  users of the App).
Strange, but
that is it. The rest is the technical stuff that must be processed in order to
provide you with our services.
Information collected automatically or assigned
  by Us to you
Legal basis for processing
1.
The server that hosts the App may record
  requests your device makes to the server, the details on device and browser
  you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country,
  operating system, browser type, mobile network information.
Performance
  of the contract.
The App
  would not operate otherwise, you need this to connect to the Internet.
This data
  is used only for technical purposes – that is, to ensure the proper functioning
  and security of the App and to investigate possible security incidents.
2.
Advertising identifiers provided by the
  operating system of your handheld device (such as, for instance, IDFA)
Your
  consent to the provision of such identifiers given by default through the
  operating system of your device (Apple iOS, for instance). You are free to
  withdraw your consent by resetting those identifiers or opting out of
interest based
advertising.
This may
  be done via the settings of your handset and/or your browser. We respect
  those choices you make through the settings of your device.
3.
Various device identifiers, provided by the
  operating system (device ID or a vendor ID, for instance)
Our
  legitimate interests in fraud prevention and potential unauthorized access
  from multiple devices/locations, ensuring the technical availability and
  security of the App.
4.
App version, OS version information, browser
  type, language used, make/model of your device
Performance
  of the contract.
We need to
  know this technical information so the App functions properly on your device.
5.
All the events that naturally occur during
  your usage of the App. Statistical information with regards to App usage.
Partly,
  performance of the contract and partly our legitimate interests in fraud
  prevention and potential unauthorized access, ensuring the technical
  availability and security of the App.
Analysis
  of statistical information helps us to optimize the App in future updates,
  such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any
  personal data of yourself or your contacts.
3.
What we do
with your personal data
We protect
your data and do not treat your personal data in any way that would surprise
you (unless We told you about it and you made an informed decision to consent
to such usage).
We use the
advertising identifiers in strict compliance with the requirements of the
operating systems (for otherwise We would be in breach of their usage terms). Thus,
We
only use those advertising identifiers to meet our
contractual obligations towards the parties that brought you to Us and vice
versa (to trace the effectiveness of ad campaigns, for instance).
Unless you
have asked us not to,
We
may rarely contact you by
email about similar products and services to the App (the so-called
“newsletter” email). Whenever We contact you,
We
would
always give you the right to opt out prior to the first communication and at
any time thereafter (see the section
“Your
Rights”
below). If you allow push notifications through your device
settings, you may receive such notifications from us when relevant. You can
always disable those push notifications via the settings of your device. Please
note, where we contact you via email in relation to an update to our terms of
service or other app-related information, you could not opt-out of those as
such communication relates to the essence of our contract (the so-called
non-marketing communication).
Other purposes
for processing personal data mostly include our legitimate interests such as:
·
Fraud prevention
·
Improving
our services
·
Notifying
you of any changes in our services
4.
How long personal
data is stored
for
Depending on
the type, your personal data is stored either until you delete the App or we
are positive that you may have left us (i.e. after a certain period of
inactivity, such as if you have not logged into the App for over 6 months). Some
data (such as IP addresses or blacklisted email addresses used for fraud) may
be held for longer in our legitimate interests to protect our business from losses
and also to respect your choice of opt-outs from marketing emails.
5.
Security
measures used by Us
We use appropriate
level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or
unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to
personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
6.
Categories
of recipients

share your personal data with any third parties, except for:
·
the data
processors that act on our instructions and solely for our purposes;
·
as stated in
this privacy policy; or
·

This does
not mean that We blindly follow disclosure orders. We will check each request
to ensure it satisfies the relevant safeguards, contains a court order or is
issued under a legislative measure for the prevention, investigation, detection
or prosecution of criminal offences.

Transfer of
your data abroad
While your
data may be accessed from different parts of the world on our behalf,
We
do not actually transfer your personal data outside the
EEA. To any extent that data is accessed from abroad,
We
follow set contractual safeguards and protections to ensure that your data is
as safe abroad as it is within the EEA.
Where a third party
accesses your data on our behalf or upon our instructions (be it inside or
outside the EEA), We use the relevant legal basis to comply with the data
protection legislation. In cases where there is no finding of an adequacy
decision by the European Commission, we use model contracts to safeguard your
rights and data.
8.
Social
Network Services (SNS)
When you log
in to use any of Our Apps via an SNS (such as Facebook) you provide Us
with certain information from you profile for that site. The information provided
via SNS varies and depends on a particular SNS. You can untick the boxes for
information you prefer not to share with us during the
sign
up
process.
You can find
out more about these settings at the SNS where you use Our App (for
instance, you can edit the privacy and settings of your apps with Facebook by
following the link
https://www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=about_content
- last
accessed on 9 July 2019).
Your
activity when using the App via an SNS will also be subject to the SNS’ privacy
policy for their part of data processing.
9.
Your rights
You are
entitled to the full spectrum of the rights under the General Data Protection Regulation
and We will go out of our way to accommodate any valid request. You can either
exercise your rights by deleting certain features through your device or by
emailing us at
support@temp.com
to exercise all the other rights.
You have a
wide array of rights that we respect. Among those the right to:
·
Require
access to your personal data;
·
Require
rectification of your personal data;
·
Require
erasure of your personal data;
·
Withdraw
consent to processing of your personal data, where applicable;
·
Lodge a
complaint with your national supervisory authority (in the EEA) if you believe
that your privacy rights have been breached
You may be
required to prove through a certain procedure that the request emanates from
the data subject (i.e. contact us from within the app itself and confirm a code
that we would send to the registered email address).
This is so that we do not disclose personal
data to those that are not entitled to it.
If your
personal data is erased at your request or in accordance with our data
retention policy,
We
only retain such information that
is necessary to protect our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal
obligation.
Please note,
all requests should be emailed to Us at
support@temp.com
or sent to us by post. Due to the sheer
volume of messages, in-App customer support messages cannot be regarded as an effective
method of notice to Us.
10.
Do Not Track
(California OPPA)
There is no consensus
on how mobile application companies should interpret the DNT signals. For the
purposes of the OPPA,
We
do not currently respond to
DNT signals whether that signal has been received on a computer or a mobile
device.
