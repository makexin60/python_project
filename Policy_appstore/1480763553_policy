Correct your Data - “Right to rectification”:
If you believe we hold inaccurate or missing information, please let us know and we will correct it.
Object to our use of your personal data (Right to object):
We will consider your objection to our use of your personal data.

Location Sharing: Nodle uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to securely locate and anonymously connect smart devices in exchange for NODL. Users of the Nodle App earn NODL each time their device receives data from nearby IoT devices or sensors for which the owner of the device had created a “smart mission” to reward network contributors interacting with the smart device. The Nodle App needs permission to capture device location, along with Bluetooth IoT data, at regular intervals. You earn NODL based on this data. You may change the frequency of the data or location capture using the scan modes in the Options menu of the Nodle App. You may choose to only send IoT Data to Nodle when your device is connected to a WiFi network. You can stop collection of precise location data from the Nodle App or a third party app with the Nodle SDK by withdrawing your consent through your device settings.

Limit the use of your data (Right to restriction of processing):
you can restrict our use of your personal data (if you do not want us to delete it), if you have successfully made a general objection, you are challenging the accuracy of the personal data we hold, or we have used your personal data unlawfully.
If you object to the processing or withdraw your consent or ask for the deletion of your personal data by us, we will stop processing your personal data or erase it from our IT systems, except where we have legitimate and compelling grounds for processing, or for the purpose of ascertaining, exercising, or defending its legal rights in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold;
The categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; and
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

Financial Incentives
Financial incentives are programs, benefits, or other offerings, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, or sale of personal information about them.
To be rewarded with NODL token, the Nodle App and Nodle SDK require the collection and sharing of Data in exchange for financial rewards in the form of NODL tokens. The connectivity resources require Edge Node Device Information and due to the inherent nature of connectivity protocols like BLE and Wi-Fi. If you do not provide Edge Node Device Information, you will not be able to connect to the Nodle Network, provide connectivity resources to the Nodle Network, or earn any NODL token.
NODL token rewards vary based on the data packets transmitted through the Nodle network, paying for the first few nodes that show a new packet, paying more or less depending on the value of the packet. In order to guarantee that Nodle is faithful to its mining model, Nodle has inserted a validation protocol to assess and confirm the order of arrival of beacons.
More information about the terms related to NODL token can be found in our terms and conditions.
California Shine the Light Law
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by writing to us at:
Nodle Technology Inc.
2443 Fillmore Street #287

California Do Not Track Disclosures:
“Do Not Track” is an internet browser setting regarding tracking and your browser may allow you to set a DNT signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked.
