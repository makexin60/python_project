It’s never boring when friends are around.
The Series tell the story about the adventurous life of two kittens – Lulu and Binx, their friends puppies Snickers, Sparky and Oscar and the Rabbit-inventor, Hopper. Each episode tells a story which illustrates how being together and united you can solve any problem. And those fluffy kids have the problems of their own, big and small, which they overcome all together. And being with the friends is such a fun – you can create so many new games, set off travelling for real or in your imagination.
