Privacy Policy
Everyone, including Muslims, has a right to their privacy. That's why we take it very seriously at Pillars.
Last updated: January 2023
This privacy policy is to let you know how Pillars handles data.
This notice provides you with information regarding your rights and explains how, why and when we collect and process your data.
If you have any questions or want to exercise any of your rights set out in this privacy notice, please contact us at
salaam@thepillarsapp.com

About us
We are The Pillars Group Ltd, trading as Pillars.
We are registered in England and Wales under company number 13341895.
We can be contacted by email at
salaam@thepillarsapp.com
.
What this notice covers
This privacy notice covers the Pillars App v1.x only.
Future versions of the Pillars App may involve changes to data handling policy. This will require you to review and agree to a new privacy policy covering the new changes and/or features.
We don't collect location or personal* data
We believe all users of the app (both Muslims and non-Muslims) are entitled to their privacy and have built Pillars around this central principle.
Therefore, whilst the app requires your location data to calculate bespoke prayer times for your specific geolocation, this is all done locally (i.e. on the phone) and no data whatsoever is sent to Pillars or stored by ourselves.
No other data is collected via the app (e.g. personal information*).
*this excludes email addresses if you have signed up to our mailing list (to facilitate email updates).
Email address data
We collect the email addresses of individuals who have signed up to our mailing list, beta programme (early adopter) and premium subscription. This is necessary to enable us to be able to identify who should be given access. For email addresses we also include some basic data around your engagement with our emails. This is limited to information around whether you open our emails or not and click on links inside them.
Mobile number data (premium subscription only)
We collect the mobile numbers of individuals who have signed up to our premium subscription. This is necessary as one of the ways Apple identifies your Apple ID is via your mobile number (as well as your email).
Global transfer and processing
We do not collect any data apart from your email address. This may be stored and processed in any country where we operate, or where other companies provide services to us (e.g. Flodesk for mailing list). By signing up to our mailing list, you're agreeing to let us store it in, and transfer your email address to these countries.
Flodesk & Revue
We use Flodesk & Revue as a service provider in order to deliver email updates. The way Flodesk & Revue store and process your data is subject to their Privacy Policy (
https://www.privacypolicies.com/privacy/view/bb9c8c7ecbee39b15f2f5be574def422
&
https://www.getrevue.co/privacy/
).
‍
Plausible
Plausible is lightweight and open source web analytics for our Pillars website (thepillarsapp.com). It gives us basic information such as how many people are visiting our website. It's an alternative to analytical tools such as Google Analytics which have significant privacy concerns. Plausible has no cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR. We do not currently use any analytics on our app. You can find out more about their privacy policy here (
https://plausible.io/privacy
).
Email address retention
We'll keep your email address and name for the purpose of sending you updates until either we decide to stop sending updates, or you ask us to delete your data by getting in touch at
salaam@thepillarsapp.com
.
Your marketing preferences
When you sign up to our mailing list, you are opting in to receive updates on our product by email. You can opt out of these email communications at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any message we send to you, or by contacting us at
salaam@thepillarsapp.com

Under data protection regulation, you have...
the right to be informed about the collection and use of your personal data
the right to access the personal data we hold about you via a Subject Access Request
the right to correct inaccurate personal data

Intuit Global Privacy Statement
Last Updated: September 8, 2024

Expand All
Collapse All
Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role
Intuit responsibly leverages technology to power prosperity around the world. We believe that everyone has a right to privacy. As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (
“Privacy Statement”
) to explain how we, Intuit Inc. and the
Intuit group companies
(collectively
“Intuit,” “we,” “us,” or “our”
), collect, use, share, or otherwise process information that we collect through our services. These services include, as applicable, our websites, mobile applications, social media pages, marketing activities, and other activities described in this Privacy Statement, or when other businesses provide us your personal information (collectively, the
“Services”
). This Privacy Statement is global, meaning it applies to all Intuit Services. We may provide additional or supplemental privacy statements for certain products or services.
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices when we process:
Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “
Tax Preparation Information
”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;
Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of our websites and the Intuit platform, which includes all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) other than Tax Preparation Information (the “
Intuit Platform
”); and
Personal information as necessary to manage, run, improve, and develop our business and personalize your experience while interacting with the Intuit Platform. Depending on your settings, this may include showing you personalized ads or recommending certain Intuit products based on your interests.
Intuit determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement, and therefore acts as a ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms under applicable data privacy laws) of such information. We may share your personal information within the
Intuit group companies
and conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your personal information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities. This means we determine how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable data privacy laws. Intuit is not responsible for other data controllers’ processing activities, and you should contact them directly for questions about how they process your personal information and about how to exercise your privacy rights in relation to such processing.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to certain processing activities where we are not the controller. For example, where Intuit processes personal information as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, including when we process personal information on behalf of customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a processor or service provider, the privacy statement of the customer who uses our Services applies, instead of this Privacy Statement, and our processing of such personal information is governed by our agreements with such customers. If you have concerns about personal information that we process on behalf of a customer, or wish to exercise your privacy rights regarding such personal information, please contact the customer directly.
This Privacy Statement also does not apply to Intuit Financial Services or Intuit’s processing of education records subject to state or federal laws or children’s data in our education curriculum products. You may find the privacy statement for Intuit Financial Services
here
, and the privacy statement for Intuit for Education
here
.
If you have any questions about how Intuit processes your personal information, please see How to contact us below.
The Intuit platform
The Intuit Platform and your personal information
When we say “platform,” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), Intuit uses that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using. This means that, for example, we may use your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, contact and purchase history details from Mailchimp, and/or recommendations from Credit Karma. The personal information we use in this centralized way may relate to you as an end user of our Services or as a customer or vendor of an Intuit customer whose personal information has been included in the Intuit Platform.
Business account information
Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with a business (such as your employer). If you are granted access to a business account (for example, in QuickBooks), the business owner or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If the owner or designated administrator changes your access rights, then you may lose access to the information the business controls.
Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of a business account may be subject to the business’s policies, which may differ from this Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other businesses, and you should consider both the business’s policies and whether you are comfortable giving the business access to your personal information before connecting to their services.
Personal information we collect
The personal information that we collect or otherwise receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings. The way we process your personal information may also depend on the particular Services, functionalities, or experiences you use, your location, and applicable law.
Information you provide to us
You may provide us with your information as follows:
Contact data and account profile data.
We collect information when you (or your organization) create an account, activate a subscription, and/or upload information to the Intuit Platform. Personal information may include your name, previous name(s) and/or nicknames, title and honorifics, professional title and company name, education, billing and mailing addresses, phone number and email address, profile photo, billing information (your payment information), purchase history, demographic information, preferences, subscription data, and your username and account credentials.
Identity verification information.
We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, date of birth, social security number, social insurance number, driver’s license number, passport number, government-issued identification details, and similar information to verify your identity and to help you file your tax return.
Communications, feedback and survey data, and related data.
We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number and any other personal information you choose to share when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, attend our events, participate in product research or training, or otherwise interact or communicate with us. This information may include: call center recordings and call monitoring records, chat and text records, voicemails, photographs, and video images.
Marketing data.
You may provide us with your contact information and preferences for receiving marketing communications.
Social and community content.
We receive content you post on our social media pages and our community pages.
Business and financial information.
We may receive information about your business, your finances, expenses, invoices, financial statements, details of your financial transactions, payroll details, payment details, tax return details, details about your customers, vendors, or employees, income and wage information, and/or investment information.
Interactions with experts.
The Intuit Platform provides many opportunities for you to connect with live experts, including, for example, accountants or tax preparers. When you interact with these experts, we may receive information about the questions you ask, the details of your accounts, and the guidance provided to you.
Interactions with chatbots.
We may receive information from you through your use of chatbots, digital assistants, or other interactive bots across the Intuit Platform.
Device and contact data.
If you grant permission in your device settings, certain features may have access to your device and contacts.
Business connection data.
We may collect information about you when you interact with the Intuit Platform through our customers. If you are a customer, vendor or prospect of an Intuit customer and interact with the Intuit Platform (for example, to pay an invoice, make a purchase, interact with an email, provide contact details or complete a survey), we will use this information to make recommendations about you to our customers. Our customers may also provide business connection data directly about you to us; this is described below under ‘Other users’.
Third-party sources
The Intuit Platform is designed to help you connect with other people and businesses. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input personal information about you, including other customers using the Intuit Platform. For example, an Intuit customer may share personal information about you with us in order to use and benefit from the Intuit Platform. You also may be able to input or process personal information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator of one of our products or use Intuit to manage customer lists. If you input information about others into the Platform, you must only do so if you have first provided sufficient notice and received any required permissions, and have an appropriate legal basis if required by applicable law.
We may also receive personal information about you from other third parties where you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process the personal information obtained from those third parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our third-party sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform. For example, we receive information from:
Linked third-party services.
If you choose to sync a non-Intuit account/service with your Intuit account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. This may include details of your bank account information, social media information, purchase history or your business’s sales records through a point of sale application.
Supplemental information and identity verification providers.
We work with certain third parties to help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business, and/or supplement the personal information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your personal information. For example, we use third-party providers to validate your contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, phone number) or to provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial institution, telecommunications provider, or email provider.
Customer support providers.
We receive personal information about you or your interaction with the Intuit Platform from certain third parties for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain information about your interaction(s) with customer support and information about technical issues you have raised, including call center recordings, call monitoring records, voicemails, photographs and chat records.
Credit bureaus and related third parties.
Many Intuit features rely on information we receive from credit bureaus and related third parties. For example, in some countries, we may offer free credit reports and credit scores. We request these reports and credit scores on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. These partners may also provide personal information such as employment or income data, social security number, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so we can make more personalized recommendations for you.
Other users.
As described above, we may receive personal information about you from other Intuit Platform users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, spouse, employer, or other business customers using the Intuit Platform (e.g., businesses from which you buy products or services, or with which you otherwise interact). We may also collect such personal information through features like member referral programs.
Risk management, cybersecurity & anti-fraud providers.
We may receive personal information from third parties that help us assess risks associated with our offerings, including to help combat fraud and illegal activity and to help protect your personal information.
Data providers.
We may receive information from information services and data licensors that provide demographic and preference information to us.
Content providers.
We may receive personal information from companies that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.
Joint offering partners.
We may offer co-branded services or experiences or engage in joint-marketing activities with others, including through our conferences or live events.
Government agencies.
We receive information from government agencies, including from various tax agencies, such as your tax filing confirmation from the IRS.
Public information.
We collect individual and household demographic information and preference information from publicly available sources, such as open government databases, social media platforms, and others.
Automatic data collection
We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log personal information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, such as:
Device information.
We may collect information about your device(s) such as IP addresses, log information, error messages, device type, and unique device identifiers. For example, we may collect IP addresses from you as part of our sign in and security features.
Usage information.
We may collect information about your use of the Intuit Platform, such as the pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type, and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.
Location information.
Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you or your organization grant(s) us permission to do so through your device settings (for example, if you use QuickBooks’ time-tracking service, participate in Karma Drive, or use CK Money to locate nearby ATMs).
Information stored locally.
Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.
Communication interaction data.
We or our third-party service providers may collect information from email providers, communication providers and social networks, such as your interactions with our email, text or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) – we may do this through use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails.
Online behavioral data
. We may automatically collect certain personal information about your use and interactions with our websites, customers’ websites or e-commerce stores, social media websites, and marketing campaigns that we or our customers organize, including device information (such as your IP address and unique device IDs), page view information and search results, links, and if you are a customer contact, whether or not a campaign presented or sent to you using our offerings has been viewed, delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it has bounced or was treated as spam.
Cookies and similar technologies
Intuit and our service providers may use commonly used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects and similar technologies (collectively “cookies”) to collect information about you (“
Cookie Information
”) so we can provide the experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers’ experiences. For example, we may use session-replay technologies,
such as those provided by FullStory and Medallia, that employ software code to record users’ interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch video replays of those user sessions. The replays include users’ clicks, mobile app touches, mouse movements, scrolls and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. You can learn more about FullStory at
https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy
and you can opt-out of session recording by FullStory at
https://www.fullstory.com/optout/

How we share your personal information
When you interact with our services.
We may share your personal information in the following circumstances:
For certain product features

If you choose to use those features, you acknowledge and agree that you are also bound by the third party’s privacy policy. You may manage your YouTube API data by visiting Google’s security settings page
here
. You may make choices about your Twilio API data by visiting Twilio’s privacy notice
here
.
When you connect with an Intuit Platform partner.
You may be provided with offers, products, and services from third-party companies who integrate with our Intuit Platform. If you choose to interact with a platform partner, apply for their services or offerings, or otherwise link or sync your account to a platform partner’s product or service, you consent and direct us to share your personal information to the platform partner providing the service or offering. For example, when we send your personal information to partners in order to generate offers for you to review, when we send your application information directly to our partners, or when we send you to the partner’s site for you to provide the information directly to them.
In some cases, if you click through to go to a platform partner’s site, you will automatically be sending your personal information to that platform partner. When this happens, you will still have to submit your application on the platform partner’s site. Remember that any information you provide to a platform partner, whether through us or on your own, will be subject to their privacy practices and terms and conditions.
When you connect to your social media account.
Some of our features enable you to connect to a social media account or share information on social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter. Any information you choose to share on social media may potentially be visible to a global audience and will be subject to the social media provider’s privacy policies (not this Privacy Statement). You should take care only to share information on social media that you are comfortable sharing.
For joint features, sales, promotions and events.
With your consent we may share your personal information with third parties who are jointly providing features, sales initiatives, promotions or events with us.
When you publicly post the information.
We may provide opportunities for you to publicly post reviews, questions, comments, suggestions, or other content that may include personal information, such as your name or username. Anything you share in a public forum is public, and you should think carefully before you decide to share.
With your wireless carrier.
When you use your wireless device in connection with the Intuit Platform, you authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to Intuit or its service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud.
When you participate in the short code program
. Personal information collected through the short code program (i.e., when you sign up for SMS texts), will not be shared, sold, or rented to affiliated or unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Other circumstances.
We also share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances.
For research.
With appropriate controls, we may share information with third parties, such as academic institutions, government and non-profit organizations, for research purposes or to publish academic or policy-related materials. We only share information in a way that does not identify any individual.
With financial services providers.
In connection with our financial products, we may share personal information with collection agencies, credit bureaus and loan services providers, and payment card association members. We may also share your personal information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents, government agencies, and card associations in connection with issues related to fraud, credit, defaults, or debt collection.
With service providers or agents.
We share personal information with our service providers or agents who provide services on our behalf for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. Service providers or agents are required to implement reasonable privacy and information protection controls to maintain the privacy and security of information provided to them consistent with the privacy practices outlined in this Privacy Statement. Service providers or agents may include companies that assist us with our advertising, marketing, and sales efforts, help us with our technology offerings (such as a hosting, security or anti-fraud providers) and help us run our business. Service providers or agents also include AI providers, including generative AI providers.
For mergers and acquisitions.
If we are involved with a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation, bankruptcy, or the acquisition of all or part of our business to another company, we may share your personal information with that company and its advisors before and after the transaction date.
With our affiliates and subsidiaries and your right to limit information sharing.
We may share your personal information with our affiliates and subsidiaries for everyday business purposes as described in this Statement, including for marketing purposes, for improving and developing our offerings, and for personalizing your experience on our Platform. Certain laws may provide you with the right to limit our information sharing activities in certain circumstances. Please review these rights in the “Region and state-specific terms” section below.
For advertising and analytics.
Intuit may use advertising networks and other providers to display advertising on our Intuit Platform or on other sites. Intuit may share personal information with advertising networks and other providers to tailor advertising and offers presented to you based on your interactions with the Intuit Platform’s products, services, and offerings. Our advertising partners may place cookies on unaffiliated websites in order to serve advertisements that may be relevant to you based on your browsing activities and interests and determine the effectiveness of such advertisements. See also the “Region and state-specific terms” section below for additional information.
Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) responds to the Global Privacy Control signal for US residents, as described further in the United States section below. However, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals because there is no formal “Do Not Track” standard.
For legal reasons.
We may share your personal information with third parties for legal reasons without your consent, and as permitted by law, including:
When we reasonably believe disclosure is required in order to comply with a subpoena, court order, or other applicable law, regulation or legal process;
To protect the rights, property, or safety of Intuit, TurboTax, the Intuit Platform, our customers or others;
To protect or defend against attacks;
To enforce, remedy, or apply our Terms of Service or other agreements;
To prevent fraud, cybersecurity attacks or illegal activity;
For debt collection; and
With regulatory agencies, including government tax agencies, as necessary to help detect and combat fraud and/or protect our customers, users and/or the Intuit Platform, or in required institutional risk control programs.
Your personal information rights and choices

Your Rights
Depending on where you live, you may also have certain state- or country-specific rights with respect to your personal information. Please see the Region and state-specific terms section for your country, below.
Verification
To help protect privacy and the security of your personal information, you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity and/or ownership rights before we can fulfill your data rights request. If we cannot verify your identity or your ownership rights to the data, we may not be able to service your request until you provide proper documentation.
Data retention
Unless you specifically ask us to delete your personal information, we retain your personal information as long as it is necessary to comply with our data retention requirements and provide you with services and the benefits of the Intuit Platform and successfully run our business. Even if you submit a deletion request, we may be required to maintain your personal information for as long as necessary to:
comply with our legal or regulatory compliance needs (e.g., maintaining records of transactions you have made with us);
to exercise, establish or defend legal claims; and/or
to protect against fraudulent or abusive activity on our service.
This means we may keep different information for different periods. If your account is canceled because you haven’t used it for a long time, we may delete this information immediately.
There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize, or de-identify your personal information due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance, or other operational reasons. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to securely isolate your personal information from any further processing until such time as we are able to delete, anonymize, or de-identify it.
International data transfers
Unless you have provided us with consent to transfer your personal information, US Tax Preparation Information shall be processed and stored in the United States in accordance with applicable law.
With the exception noted above, Intuit reserves the right to store and process your personal information in the United States and in any other country where Intuit or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities in accordance with and as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
When we transfer, store or process personal information outside of your jurisdiction (including to or in the United States, as described above), we take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law.
Some of these recipients of your personal information are located in countries for which the European Commission, the UK (and Gibraltar) Government, and the Swiss Government (as and where applicable) have issued adequacy decisions, which means that these countries are recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under applicable UK (and Gibraltar), European, and Swiss data protection laws and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Other recipients of your personal information are located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK that are not the subject of an adequacy decision. In these cases, we may use the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or, as may be applicable, the International Data Transfer Agreement approved by the UK Government, to help ensure your personal information is protected. For more information on the transfer safeguards we rely on, please contact us by using the details in the “How to contact us” section below.
Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) and Mailchimp comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to the United States. Intuit and Mailchimp rely on the EU-U.S. DPF to transfer data and will rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF once approved by the appropriate authorities. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. You can find more information about Intuit’s and Mailchimp’s Data Privacy Framework certification

Security of your personal information
We use reasonable physical, technical and organizational safeguards that are designed to protect your personal information.

Please note that we may claim legal exemptions for certain types of personal information and certain Intuit companies from all or certain parts of the CCPA, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and other data protection laws. In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as employees and job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.

Opt-out of Sales and/or Sharing.
Like many companies, Intuit and Mailchimp use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as described above. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may classify our use of some of these services as “sharing” your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can opt-out of the “sharing” of your personal information by visiting the “Your California Privacy Rights” link in the footer of the Intuit website.
In addition, if you have enabled a recognized opt-out mechanism on your browser, device, or platform, you will automatically be opted out of any “sharings” when you interact with our Services. Please go here to learn more about enabling one such preference signal, the Global Privacy Control:
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download
. Intuit and Mailchimp do not sell personal information under the CCPA. Credit Karma does not sell or share personal information subject to the CCPA, and therefore does not offer a “Your California Privacy Rights” link on its website. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
Limit processing of sensitive personal information.
Some of the personal information that we may collect are considered sensitive personal information under the CCPA. We collect sensitive personal information for the purposes allowed by law or with your consent. We only use sensitive personal information as necessary for our (1) Service delivery and operations, (2) compliance and protection, (3) research and development, or (4) Service improvement and analytics purposes in accordance with CCPA. If we use sensitive personal information outside the permitted purposes of the CCPA, we will provide you with the right to limit processing of sensitive personal information.
California Shine the Light.
Customers who are California residents may request certain information concerning the categories of personal information (if any) we disclose to third parties or affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. If you would like more information, please submit a written request to us using the contact information provided below.
Non-discrimination
. You have the right to be free from discrimination or retaliation related to your exercise of any of your California privacy rights.
Verification.
In order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or deletion, we may require you to verify your credentials before you can submit a rights request. If you do not have an account with us, or if we suspect your account has been accessed without your authorization, we may ask you to provide additional personal information for verification. For Credit Karma members, we may require that you confirm certain pieces of personal information that we have on file and/or log into your Credit Karma account. If we are subsequently unable to confirm your identity, we may refuse your rights request.
Authorized agents.
You may use an authorized agent to submit a rights request. If you do so, the authorized agent must present signed written authorization to act on your behalf, and you will also be required to independently verify your own identity directly with us and confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the rights request. This verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent provides documentation showing that the authorized agent has power of attorney to act on your behalf under Cal. Prob. Code §§ 4121 to 4130.
Learn more about instructions for authorized agents.
We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit adequate proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.

The processing is in our legitimate business interests, such as operating our businesses, improving and developing the Intuit Platform, communicating with you, marketing our offerings and services and personalizing your experience, and to detect illegal activities; and/or
To comply with legal requirements, including applicable laws and regulations.
For residents in the UK searching for financial or other products (including energy, internet, or mobile phone offers) through the Intuit Platform, we may share your personal information, including your contact details, date of birth, as well as the information you give us about your employment, income, and housing and employment expenses with third parties, including HD Decisions, Capital One, Monevo, CarFinance 247, and Decision Tech.

2.1
Parties’ roles.
For the Permitted Purposes (defined below), the parties acknowledge and agree that with regard to the processing of Customer Data, Mailchimp processes Customer Data as a processor acting on behalf of Customer (whether itself a controller or a processor on behalf of a third party controller). For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not apply to instances where Mailchimp is the controller of Customer Data unless otherwise described in Annex C (Jurisdiction-Specific Terms) of this DPA.
2.2
Purpose limitation.
Mailchimp shall process Customer Data, as further described in Annex A (Details of Data Processing) of this DPA, only in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions as set forth in this DPA, as necessary to comply with applicable law, or as otherwise agreed in writing (“Permitted Purposes”). The parties agree that the Agreement, including this DPA, along with the Customer’s configuration of or use of any settings, features, or options in the Service (as the Customer may be able to modify from time to time) constitute the Customer’s complete and final instructions to Mailchimp in relation to the processing of Customer Data (including for the purposes of the SCCs), and processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between the parties.
2.3
Prohibited data.
Customer will not provide (or cause to be provided) any Sensitive Data to Mailchimp for processing under the Agreement, and Mailchimp will have no liability whatsoever for Sensitive Data, whether in connection with a Security Incident or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA will not apply to Sensitive Data.
2.4
Customer compliance.
Customer represents and warrants that (i) it has complied, and will continue to comply, with all applicable laws, including Data Protection Laws, in respect of its processing of Customer Data and any processing instructions it issues to Mailchimp; and (ii) it has provided, and will continue to provide, all notice and has obtained, and will continue to obtain, all consents and rights necessary under Data Protection Laws for Mailchimp to process Customer Data for the purposes described in the Agreement. Customer shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Data and the means by which Customer acquired Customer Data. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for complying with all laws (including Data Protection Laws) applicable to any Campaigns (as defined in the Agreement) or other content created, sent, or managed through the Service, including those relating to obtaining consents (where required) to send emails, the content of the emails and its email deployment practices.
2.5
Lawfulness of Customer’s instructions.
Customer will ensure that Mailchimp’s processing of the Customer Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions will not cause Mailchimp to violate any applicable law, regulation, or rule, including, without limitation, Data Protection Laws. Mailchimp shall promptly notify Customer in writing, unless prohibited from doing so under European Data Protection Laws, if it becomes aware or believes that any data processing instruction from Customer violates European Data Protection Laws. Where Customer acts as a processor on behalf of a third-party controller (or other intermediary to the ultimate controller), Customer warrants that its processing instructions as set out in the Agreement and this DPA, including its authorizations to Mailchimp for the appointment of Sub-processors in accordance with this DPA, have been authorized by the relevant controller. Customer shall serve as the sole point of contact for Mailchimp and Mailchimp need not interact directly with (including to provide notifications to or seek authorization from) any third-party controller other than through regular provision of the Service to the extent required under the Agreement. Customer shall be responsible for forwarding any notifications received under this DPA to the relevant controller, where appropriate.
3. Sub-processing
3.1
Authorized Sub-processors.
Customer authorizes Mailchimp or any member of the Mailchimp Group on behalf of/for the benefit of Mailchimp to engage Sub-processors to process Customer Data, in accordance with Section 3.2, to assist Mailchimp in fulfilling its obligations with respect to providing the Service pursuant to the Agreement. The Sub-processors currently engaged by Mailchimp and authorized by Customer are available
here
. Mailchimp shall notify Customer if it adds or removes Sub-processors at least 10 days prior to any such changes if Customer opts in to receive such email notifications by clicking
here
.
3.2
Sub-processor obligations.
Mailchimp shall: (i) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the same level of protection for Customer Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the service provided by such Sub-processor; and (ii) remain responsible for such Sub-processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-processor that cause Mailchimp to breach any of its obligations under this DPA. Customer acknowledges and agrees that, where applicable, Mailchimp fulfills its obligations under Clause 9 of the 2021 Controller-to-Processor Clauses and 2021 Processor-to-Processor Clauses (as applicable) by complying with this Section 3 and that Mailchimp may be prevented from disclosing Sub-processor agreements to Customer due to confidentiality restrictions but Mailchimp shall, upon request, use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with all relevant information it reasonably can in connection with Sub-processor agreements.
4. Security

Updates to Security Measures.
Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Mailchimp relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Service meets Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws.

4.4
Security Incident response.
Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Mailchimp shall: (i) notify Customer without undue delay; (ii) provide Customer with information, subject to Mailchimp's privacy and data security policies, confidentiality and legal requirements, as may be reasonably necessary to assist Customer with its notification and reporting responsibilities; and (iii) take appropriate steps to identify the cause of the Security Incident and minimize and secure the Customer Data, to the extent remediation is within Mailchimp's reasonable control. Mailchimp’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this DPA shall not be construed as an acknowledgment by Mailchimp of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident. Mailchimp will not assess the contents of Customer Data to identify any specific reporting or other legal obligations that are applicable to the Customer. Any and all regulatory and/or data subject reporting obligations related to the Security Incident are the responsibility to the Customer. Notification(s) of any Security Incident(s) by Mailchimp shall be delivered to the notification email or address provided in the Agreement. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that the notification contact details (e.g., phone and email) are valid and accurate.
4.5
Customer responsibilities.
Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that except as provided by this DPA, Customer is responsible for its secure use of the Service, including securing its account authentication credentials, protecting the security of Customer Data when in transit to and from the Service, and taking any appropriate steps to securely encrypt or backup any Customer Data uploaded to the Service.
5. Security Reports and Audits

Customers may submit their requests
here

6.1
Data center locations.
Subject to Section 6.2, Customer acknowledges that Mailchimp may transfer and process Customer Data to and in the United States and anywhere else in the world where Mailchimp, its Affiliates or its Sub-processors maintain data processing operations. Mailchimp shall at all times ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws and this DPA.
6.2
Australian data.
To the extent that Mailchimp is a recipient of Customer Data protected by the Australian Privacy Law, the parties acknowledge and agree that Mailchimp may transfer such Customer Data outside of Australia as permitted by the terms agreed upon by the parties and subject to Mailchimp complying with this DPA and the Australian Privacy Law.
6.3
European Data Transfers.
To the extent that Mailchimp is a recipient of Customer Data protected by European Data Protection Laws in a country outside of EEA that is not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (as described in applicable European Data Protection Laws), the parties agree to abide by and process such Customer Data in compliance with the following:
(a) Data Privacy Framework.
Mailchimp will use the Data Privacy Framework to lawfully receive Customer Data in the United States and ensure that it provides at least the same level of protection to such Customer Data as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles and will let Customer know if it is unable to comply with this request.
(b) Standard Contractual Clauses.
If European Data Protection Laws require that appropriate safeguards are put in place (for example, if the Data Privacy Framework does not cover the transfer to Mailchimp and/or the Data Privacy Framework is invalidated) the SCCs shall be incorporated into and form an integral part of this DPA.
(c) UK Data Transfers.
With respect to transfers to which the UK Data Protection Laws apply, the SCCs shall, where applicable in accordance with (b) above, apply and shall be deemed amended as specified by the UK Addendum. The UK Addendum shall be deemed executed by the parties and incorporated into and form an integral part of this DPA. In addition: Tables 1 to 3 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Annexes I and II of the relevant SCCs; and Table 4 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be deemed completed by selecting "neither party".
(d) Swiss Data Transfers.
With respect to transfers to which the Swiss DPA apply, the SCCs shall, where applicable in accordance with (b) above, apply with the following modifications: (i) references to "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" shall be interpreted as references to the Swiss DPA; (ii) references to specific Articles of "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" shall be replaced with the equivalent article or section of the Swiss DPA; (iii) references to "EU", "Union" and "Member State law" shall be replaced with "Switzerland"; (iv) Clause 13(a) and Part C of Annex II shall be deleted; (v) references to the "competent supervisory authority" and "competent courts" shall be replaced with "the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner" and "relevant courts in Switzerland"; (vi) Clause 17 shall be replaced to state "The Clauses are governed by the laws of Switzerland"; and (vii) Clause 18 shall be replaced to state "any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the applicable courts of Switzerland. The parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts".
6.4
Compliance with the SCCs.
The parties agree that if Mailchimp cannot ensure compliance with the SCCs (where applicable), it shall promptly inform Customer of its inability to comply. If Customer intends to suspend the transfer of European Data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service, it shall first provide notice to Mailchimp and provide Mailchimp with a reasonable period of time to cure such non-compliance, during which time Mailchimp and Customer shall reasonably cooperate to agree what additional safeguards or measures, if any, may be reasonably required. Customer shall only be entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service for non-compliance with the SCCs if Mailchimp has not or cannot cure the non-compliance within a reasonable period.
6.5
Alternative Transfer Mechanism.
To the extent Mailchimp adopts an alternative lawful data transfer mechanism for the transfer of European Data not described in this DPA (“Alternative Transfer Mechanism”), the Alternative Transfer Mechanism shall apply instead of the transfer mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such Alternative Transfer Mechanism complies with applicable European Data Protection Laws and extends to the countries to which European Data is transferred). In addition, if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or supervisory authority orders (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this DPA cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer European Data (within the meaning of applicable European Data Protection Laws), Mailchimp may implement any additional measures or safeguards that may be reasonably required to enable the lawful transfer of European Data.
7. Return or Deletion of Data
Deletion or return on termination.
Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Mailchimp shall shall take reasonable measures to provide tools for Customer (at Customer’s election) to delete or return to Customer all Customer Data (including copies) in its possession or control, except that this requirement shall not apply to the extent Mailchimp is required by applicable law or industry rules to retain some or all of the Customer Data, or to Customer Data it has archived on back-up systems, which Customer Data Mailchimp shall securely isolate, protect from any further processing and eventually delete in accordance with Mailchimp’s deletion policies, except to the extent required by applicable law. The parties agree that the certification of deletion of Customer Data described in Clause 8.5 and 16(d) of the 2021 Controller-to-Processor Clauses and 2021 Processor-to-Processor Clauses (as applicable) shall be provided by Mailchimp to Customer only upon Customer’s written request.
8. Data Subject Rights and Cooperation
8.1
Data subject requests.
As part of the Service, Mailchimp provides Customer with a number of
self-service features
, that Customer may use to retrieve, correct, delete, or restrict the use of Customer Data, which Customer may use to assist it in connection with its (or its third-party controller’s) obligations under the Data Protection Laws with respect to responding to requests from data subjects via Customer’s account at no additional cost. In addition, Mailchimp shall, considering the nature of the processing, provide reasonable additional assistance to Customer to the extent possible to enable Customer (or its third-party controller) to comply with its data protection obligations with respect to data subject rights under Data Protection Laws. In the event that any such request is made to Mailchimp directly, Mailchimp shall not respond to such communication directly except as appropriate (for example, to direct the data subject to contact Customer) or legally required, without Customer’s prior authorization. If Mailchimp is required to respond to such a request, Mailchimp shall, where the Customer is identified or identifiable from the request, promptly notify Customer and provide Customer with a copy of the request unless Mailchimp is legally prohibited from doing so. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Agreement (including this DPA) shall restrict or prevent Mailchimp from responding to any data subject or data protection authority requests in relation to personal data for which Mailchimp is a controller.
8.2
Data protection impact assessment.
To the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws, Mailchimp shall (considering the nature of the processing and the information available to Mailchimp) provide all reasonably requested information regarding the Service to enable Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities as required by Data Protection Laws. Mailchimp shall comply with the foregoing by: (i) complying with Section 5 (Security Reports and Audits); (ii) providing the information contained in the Agreement, including this DPA; and (iii) if the foregoing sub-sections (i) and (ii) are insufficient for Customer to comply with such obligations, upon request, providing additional reasonable assistance (at Customer’s expense).

In the event of any conflict or ambiguity between the Jurisdiction-Specific Terms and any other terms of this DPA, the applicable Jurisdiction-Specific Terms will take precedence, but only to the extent of the Jurisdiction-Specific Terms’ applicability to Mailchimp.
10. Limitation of Liability

11.5 No one other than a party to this DPA, its successors and permitted assignees shall have any right to enforce any of its terms.

Annex C - Jurisdiction-Specific Terms
Europe:
Objection to Sub-processors.
Customer may object in writing to Mailchimp’s appointment of a new Sub-processor within five (5) calendar days of receiving notice in accordance with Section 3.1 of the DPA, provided that such objection is based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such event, the parties shall discuss such concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, Mailchimp will, at its sole discretion, either not appoint such Sub-processor, or permit Customer to suspend or terminate the affected Service in accordance with the termination provisions in the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by Customer prior to suspension or termination).
Government data access requests.
As a matter of general practice, Mailchimp does not voluntarily provide government agencies or authorities (including law enforcement) with access to or information about Mailchimp accounts (including Customer Data). If Mailchimp receives a compulsory request (whether through a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or other valid legal process) from any government agency or authority (including law enforcement) for access to or information about a Mailchimp account (including Customer Data) belonging to a Customer whose primary contact information indicates the Customer is located in Europe, Mailchimp shall: (i) review the legality of the request; (ii) inform the government agency that Mailchimp is a processor of the data; (iii) attempt to redirect the agency to request the data directly from Customer; (iv) notify Customer via email sent to Customer’s primary contact email address of the request to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; and (v) provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to the agency or authority based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. As part of this effort, Mailchimp may provide Customer’s primary and billing contact information to the agency. Mailchimp shall not be required to comply with this paragraph 2 if it is legally prohibited from doing so, or it has a reasonable and good-faith belief that urgent access is necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual, public safety, or Mailchimp’s property, the Mailchimp Site, or Service, but where Mailchimp is legally prohibited from notifying Customer of requests it shall use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition.
California:
The following terms apply where Mailchimp processes personal data subject to US Data Protection Laws:
Except as described otherwise, the definitions of: “controller” includes “Business”; “processor” includes “Service Provider”; “data subject” includes “Consumer”; “personal data” includes “Personal Information”; in each case as defined under the CCPA. The terms, “sell”; “share”; “Business Purpose” and “Commercial Purpose” shall take their meanings as defined in the CCPA.
If and to the extent that Mailchimp acts as a processor or controller when processing Customer Data as set forth in Section 2 above, then Mailchimp shall take the same processing role, as applicable, under all US Data Protection Laws other than the CCPA.
With respect to personal data subject to the CCPA, parties agree and acknowledge that (i) Mailchimp may act as a “Service Provider” under the CCPA in instances in which Mailchimp acts as a Controller under other applicable Data Protection Laws and (ii) Mailchimp shall have the right to process Customer Data for any and all purposes permitted for Service Providers under the CCPA. Mailchimp shall comply with all requirements set forth in the CCPA and Section 7051 to the CCPA Regulations, and/or any successor Regulations, and such provisions are incorporated herein by reference.
Mailchimp’s obligations regarding data subject requests, as described in Section 8 (Data Subject Rights and Cooperation) of this DPA, extend to rights requests under US Data Protection Laws. Mailchimp shall provide the same level of protection to Customer Data as required by the CCPA and will: (i) assist Customer in responding to any request from a consumer (as defined under US Data Protection Laws) to exercise rights under US Data Protection Laws; and (ii) immediately notify Customer if it is not able to meet the requirements under US Data Protection Laws. In cases where Mailchimp is a Service Provider under the CCPA but otherwise is a data controller under the Data Protection Laws, and a consumer makes a request to exercise rights under the CCPA directly to Mailchimp, Customer hereby instructs Mailchimp to respond to any such request directly to the consumer.  Customer is responsible for ensuring that it has complied, and will continue to comply with the requirements of US Data Protection Laws in its use of the Services and its own processing of personal data.
The parties acknowledge that Customer Data that Customer discloses to Mailchimp is provided only for the limited and specified purposes set forth as Permitted Purposes. The parties agree that all Customer Data is disclosed to Mailchimp by Customer for the Permitted Purposes and its use or disclosure by Customer to Mailchimp is necessary to perform such Permitted Purposes.
Notwithstanding any use restriction contained elsewhere in this DPA, Mailchimp shall process Customer Data to perform the Service, for the Permitted Purposes and/or in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.
Notwithstanding any use restriction contained elsewhere in this Annex C, Mailchimp may de-identify or aggregate Customer Data as part of performing the Service specified in this DPA and the Agreement.
Where Sub-processors process Customer Data, Mailchimp takes steps to ensure that such Sub-processors are Service Providers under the CCPA with whom Mailchimp has entered into a written contract that includes terms substantially similar to this section of Annex C or are otherwise exempt from the CCPA. Mailchimp conducts appropriate due diligence on its Sub-processors.
Without limiting the data use rights set forth herein, as a Service Provider, Mailchimp will not: (a.)	sell or share any Customer Data; (b.)	retain, use, or disclose any Customer Data (i) for any purpose other than for the Permitted Purposes, including for any Commercial Purpose, or (ii) outside of the direct business relationship between the parties, except as necessary to perform the Permitted Purposes or as otherwise permitted by US Data Protection Laws; or (c.)	combine Customer Data received from or on behalf of Customer with personal data received from or on behalf of any third party or collected from Mailchimp’s own interaction with individuals or data subjects, except to perform a Permitted Purpose in accordance with the CCPA (including any implementing regulations thereto), the Agreement, and this DPA.

TL;DR:
For plausible.io visitors, we do not use cookies and we do not collect any personal data. If you decide to create an account, we ask for the bare minimum and only share it with services that are absolutely necessary for the app to function.
At Plausible Analytics, we are committed to complying with GDPR, CCPA, PECR and other privacy regulations on our website and on our web analytics product too. The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us.
In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data is handled and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.
If you have placed the Plausible Analytics script on your website, take a look at
our data policy
for details on the information we do collect about your website visitors on your behalf.
As a visitor to the plausible.io website
The privacy of our website visitors is important to us so we do not track any individual people. As a visitor to the plausible.io website:
No personal information is collected
No information such as cookies is stored in the browser
No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties
No information is shared with advertising companies
No information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends
No information is monetized
We run the Plausible Analytics script to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected. You can view the data we collect in
our live demo
.
Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. You can see full details in
our data policy
.
As a customer and subscriber of Plausible Analytics
Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need and that we will solely process this information to provide you with the service you signed up for.
We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain service offerings. These service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection, data privacy and security standards.
We only share information with them that is required for the services offered and we contractually bind them to keep any information we share with them as confidential and to process personal data only according to our instructions.
Here’s what that means in practice:
What we collect, what we use it for and services we use
An email address is required to create an account
. You need to provide us with your email address if you want to create a Plausible Analytics account. That’s just so you can log in and personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates or other essential information.
A persistent first-party cookie is stored to remember you’re logged in
. If you log in to your Plausible account, you give us permission to use cookies so you don’t have to log in on each returning session. This makes it easier for you to use our product. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. Cookies that are already stored may be deleted at any time.
All of the data that we collect is
kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on 100% renewable energy powered server in Falkenstein, Germany
. The server is owned by Hetzner, a European company. This ensures that all of the site data is being covered by the European Union’s strict laws on data privacy. Your site data never leaves the EU. See
Hetzner privacy policy
for full details.
We use Bunny (another European-owned provider from Slovenia) for a global CDN, DNS and DDoS protection. This ensures that
all visitor data we collect is exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European companies
. See Bunny
privacy and data policy
for full details.
We use UpCloud (also European-owned provider based in Finland) for
database hosting and storage of data exports
. See UpCloud
security and privacy policy
for full details.
The payment process is handled by a third-party payment provider
. If you choose to upgrade to a Plausible Analytics paid plan, the billing information and the payment process is handled by Paddle. See the
Paddle Privacy Policy
for full details.
All emails are sent using a third-party email provider
. Transactional emails and email reports (should you choose to subscribe to them) are sent using Postmark. We have disabled both open tracking and link tracking on all emails sent. See the
Postmark Privacy Policy
for full details.
We use Gravatar to get your account profile picture
. We use a proxy for this request to ensure no information is exposed to third parties. This method prevents the IP address, user agent and referrer header from being sent. See the
Gravatar Privacy Policy
for more details.
We use DuckDuckGo to get your site favicon
. We use a proxy for this request to ensure no information is exposed to third parties. This method prevents the IP address, user agent and referrer header from being sent. See the
DuckDuckGo Privacy Policy
for more details.
If you choose to import your Google Analytics data, integrate with Search Console or use the Looker Studio connector
, you will need to connect your Google account to Plausible. Google will share your name, email address, language preference, profile picture and website stats with us which allows us to provide the services you requested. We never sell or share this data with any third-parties. The use and transfer of information received from
Google APIs adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy
including the Limited Use requirements.
When you write to us with a question or to ask for help
. We keep that correspondence, which includes the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future. We use this data solely in connection with answering the queries we receive. We use Help Scout (
privacy policy
) as our help desk software.
When you submit feedback or feature requests
. We keep that feedback which includes the email address. We use this to understand the popularity of requests and to send you a notification when the feature you requested has been released. We use Nolt (
privacy policy
) as our feedback board.
We use CAPTCHA service as a means of spam protection on our account registration form
. hCaptcha is a GDPR-compliant and privacy-friendly captcha. See the
hCaptcha Privacy Policy
for full details.
For our blog readers who choose the option to receive blog posts via email
. We use Mailchimp to send those blog posts. We have disabled both open tracking and link tracking on all emails sent. See the
Mailchimp Privacy Policy
for full details.
Retention of data
We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the services or as otherwise set forth in this policy.
We will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Plausible’s legal rights.
You can choose to
delete your Plausible Analytics account at any time
. All your data will be permanently deleted immediately when you delete your account.
Changes and questions
