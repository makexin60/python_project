Wir bei Apple glauben fest daran, dass Datenschutz ein Grundrecht ist – und dass dieses Grundrecht nicht davon abhängen sollte, wo auf der Welt Sie leben.
Aus diesem Grund behandeln wir alle Daten, die sich auf eine identifizierte oder identifizierbare Person beziehen oder die von Apple mit dieser Person verknüpft oder verknüpfbar sind, als „personenbezogene Daten“, unabhängig davon, wo die Person lebt.
Das bedeutet, dass sowohl Daten, die Sie direkt identifizieren – z. B. Ihr Name – als auch Daten, die Sie nicht direkt identifizieren, die aber zu Ihrer Identifizierung verwendet werden können – z. B. die Seriennummer Ihres Geräts –, personenbezogene Daten sind. Aggregierte Daten gelten im Sinne dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie als nicht personenbezogene Daten.
Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie beschreibt, wie
Apple oder ein Apple Partnerunternehmen
(gemeinsam „Apple“) mit personenbezogenen Daten umgeht, unabhängig davon, ob Sie mit uns auf unseren Websites, über Apple Apps (wie Apple Music oder Wallet) oder persönlich (auch telefonisch oder beim Besuch eines Apple Stores) interagieren. Apple kann auch Links zu Drittanbietern auf unseren Diensten oder Apps von Drittanbietern zum Download in unserem App Store zur Verfügung stellen. Die Apple Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt nicht dafür, wie Drittanbieter personenbezogene Daten definieren oder verwenden. Wir empfehlen Ihnen, die Datenschutzrichtlinien von Drittanbietern zu lesen und sich mit Ihren Datenschutzrechten vertraut zu machen, bevor Sie mit ihnen interagieren.
Wir bei Apple geben Ihnen die Möglichkeit, Auskunft über Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu erhalten, auf sie zuzugreifen, sie zu korrigieren, zu übertragen, ihre Verarbeitung einzuschränken und sie zu löschen. Wir gewähren diese Rechte unserem weltweiten Kundenstamm, und wenn Sie sich entscheiden, diese Datenschutzrechte auszuüben, haben Sie das Recht, weder diskriminierend behandelt zu werden noch einen minderwertigen Dienst von Apple zu erhalten. Wenn Sie aufgefordert werden, der Bearbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch Apple zuzustimmen, haben Sie auch das Recht, Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zu widerrufen.
Um Ihre Rechte und Wahlmöglichkeiten in Bezug auf den Datenschutz wahrzunehmen, einschließlich der Fälle, in denen ein Drittanbieter im Namen von Apple handelt, besuchen Sie die Apple Daten- und Datenschutzseite unter
privacy.apple.com
für Apple oder
shazam.com/privacy
für Shazam.
Um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen, müssen Sie sich bei Ihrem Account anmelden, und Ihre Identität wird überprüft. Wenn Sie eine Kopie Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten wünschen, die derzeit nicht unter
privacy.apple.com
verfügbar ist, können Sie diese unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
anfordern. Sie haben auch das Recht, eine Beschwerde bei der zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörde einzureichen.
Es kann Situationen geben, in denen wir Ihrer Bitte nicht nachkommen können – zum Beispiel wenn Sie uns bitten, Ihre Transaktionsdaten zu löschen, Apple aber gesetzlich verpflichtet ist, diese Transaktion aufzuzeichnen. Wir können einen Antrag auch ablehnen, wenn dies unsere rechtmäßige Verwendung der Daten zur Betrugsbekämpfung und zu Sicherheitszwecken untergraben würde, etwa wenn Sie die Löschung eines Accounts beantragen, der wegen Sicherheitsbedenken untersucht wird. Ihre Datenschutzanfrage kann ferner abgelehnt werden, wenn sie die Privatsphäre anderer gefährdet, leichtfertig oder schikanös ist oder äußerst unpraktisch oder unangemessen wäre.
Wenn Sie in Kalifornien leben und keinen Zugriff auf die Apple Seite für Daten und Datenschutz haben
, können Sie oder Ihr Bevollmächtigter unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
oder telefonisch unter +1 800 275 2273 einen Antrag stellen.
Weitere Informationen über die Geltendmachung Ihrer Rechte finden Sie unter
support.apple.com/102283
.
Wir bei Apple sind davon überzeugt, dass wir Ihnen großartige Produkte und einen hohen Datenschutz bieten können. Dies bedeutet, dass wir bemüht sind,
nur die personenbezogenen Daten zu erfassen, die wir benötigen
. Welche personenbezogenen Daten Apple erfasst, hängt davon ab, wie Sie mit Apple interagieren. Erläuterungen zum Umgang von Apple mit personenbezogenen Daten für bestimmte einzelne Dienste finden Sie unter
apple.com/de/legal/privacy/data.
Wenn Sie einen Apple Account erstellen, einen Kredit beantragen, ein Produkt oder Gerät kaufen und/oder aktivieren, ein Softwareupdate laden, sich für einen Kurs in einem Apple Store anmelden, sich mit unseren Diensten verbinden, uns kontaktieren (auch über soziale Medien), an einer Online-Umfrage teilnehmen oder anderweitig mit Apple interagieren, können wir eine Vielzahl von Informationen erfassen, darunter:
Accountdaten.
Ihren Apple Account und zugehörige Accountdetails, einschließlich E-Mail-Adresse, registrierte Geräte, Accountstatus und Alter
Geräteinformationen.
Daten, anhand derer Ihr Gerät identifiziert werden könnte, z. B. die Seriennummer des Geräts, oder Informationen über Ihr Gerät, z. B. der Browsertyp.
Kontaktdaten
. Daten wie Name, E-Mail-Adresse, physische Adresse, Telefonnummer oder andere Kontaktinformationen
Zahlungsdaten. Daten über Ihre Rechnungsadresse und Zahlungsmethode, z. B. Bankverbindung, Kredit-, Debit- oder andere Zahlungskarteninformationen
Transaktionsdaten.
Daten über Käufe von Apple Produkten und Diensten oder von Apple unterstützte Transaktionen, einschließlich Käufen auf Apple Plattformen
Betrugsbekämpfungsdaten.
Daten, die zur Identifizierung und Bekämpfung von Betrug verwendet werden, einschließlich einer Vertrauensbewertung des Geräts.
Nutzungsdaten.
Daten über Ihre Aktivitäten und Ihre Nutzung unserer Angebote, z. B. App-Starts innerhalb unserer Dienste, einschließlich Browserverlauf; Suchverlauf; Produktinteraktion; Absturzdaten, Leistungs- und andere Diagnosedaten, sowie andere Nutzungsdaten
Standortdaten
. Genauer Standort nur zur Unterstützung von Diensten wie „Wo ist?“ oder, wenn Sie Ihre Zustimmung erteilt haben, für regionsspezifische Dienste, und ungefährer Standort
Gesundheitsdaten.
Daten, die sich auf den Gesundheitszustand einer Person beziehen, einschließlich Daten, die sich auf die physische oder psychische Gesundheit einer Person beziehen. Zu den personenbezogenen Gesundheitsdaten gehören auch Daten, die verwendet werden können, um Rückschlüsse auf den Gesundheitszustand einer Person zu ziehen oder diesen festzustellen. Wenn Sie mit einer App der Apple Health Research Study an einer Studie teilnehmen, ist die Richtlinie zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten unter
Apple Health Study Apps – Datenschutzrichtlinie
beschrieben.
Fitnessdaten.
Angaben zu Ihren Fitness- und Trainingsdaten, wenn Sie diese weitergeben möchten.
Finanzdaten.
Angaben zu Gehalt, Einkommen und Vermögen, sofern erfasst, sowie Informationen zu Finanzangeboten der Marke Apple
Daten mit behördlich ausgestellter ID.
In einigen Jurisdiktionen verlangen wir unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen eine von einer Behörde ausgestellte ID, unter anderem beim Einrichten eines Mobilfunkaccounts und dessen Aktivierung für Ihr Gerät, bei der Beantragung oder Verlängerung von Krediten, der Verwaltung von Reservierungen oder in weiteren gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Fällen.
Sonstige Informationen, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen.
Details wie der Inhalt Ihrer Kommunikation mit Apple, einschließlich Interaktionen mit dem Kundensupport und Kontakten über Social-Media-Kanäle
Sie sind nicht verpflichtet, die von uns angeforderten personenbezogenen Daten zur Verfügung zu stellen. Wenn Sie sich jedoch dagegen entscheiden, werden wir in vielen Fällen nicht in der Lage sein, Ihnen unsere Produkte oder Dienste zur Verfügung zu stellen oder auf Ihre Anfragen zu reagieren.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten über Sie von anderen
Einzelpersonen
, von Unternehmen oder Dritten, die
in Ihrem Auftrag
handeln, von unseren
Partnern, die mit uns zusammenarbeiten, um unsere Produkte und Dienste bereitzustellen und uns bei der Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung zu unterstützen, sowie von anderen
rechtmäßigen Quellen erhalten.
Einzelpersonen.
Apple kann Daten über Sie von anderen Einzelpersonen erfassen – zum Beispiel, wenn diese Person Ihnen ein Produkt oder eine Geschenkkarte geschickt, Sie zur Teilnahme an einem Apple Dienst oder Forum eingeladen oder Inhalte mit Ihnen geteilt hat.
In Ihrem Auftrag.
Sie können andere Einzelpersonen oder Dritte beauftragen, Daten an Apple weiterzugeben. Beispielsweise können Sie Ihren Mobilfunkanbieter beauftragen, Daten über Ihren Anbieter-Account zur Accountaktivierung an Apple weiterzugeben oder Informationen über Ihre Teilnahme an einem Treueprogramm weiterzugeben, damit Sie Prämien für Apple Käufe sammeln können.
Apple Partner.
Im Sinne der Sicherheit und der Betrugsbekämpfung können wir die von Ihnen bereitgestellten Informationen durch Dritte überprüfen lassen, z. B. wenn ein Apple Account erstellt wird.
Um Features wie die Suchfunktion zu verbessern und zur Erstellung von Grundlagenmodellen für KI-Funktionen verwendet Apple den Webcrawler Applebot, um Informationen zu durchforsten, die im Internet öffentlich zugänglich sind. Wir haben verschiedene Maßnahmen getroffen, um die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir erheben, zu reduzieren. Apple versucht nicht, einzelne Apple Nutzer anhand der durchsuchten Daten zu identifizieren oder Profile über Einzelpersonen zu erstellen. Wir verwenden keine privaten persönlichen Daten zum Trainieren unserer KI-Grundlagenmodelle. Wenn du dein Widerspruchsrecht in Bezug auf Verarbeitung von Informationen in Anspruch nehmen möchtest, verwende das
Formular für Anfragen zum Datenschutz von Apple Intelligence
. Weitere Informationen zum Applebot findest du auf der Seite
support.apple.com/120320
.
Für Zwecke der Forschung und Entwicklung können wir Datensätze heranziehen, die Bilder oder Sprachaufzeichnungen oder andere Daten, die Rückschlüsse auf eine identifizierbare Person zulassen, enthalten. Die Erhebung solcher Datensätze erfolgt unter Einhaltung des geltenden Rechts, einschließlich des Rechts in der Jurisdiktion, in welcher der jeweilige Datensatz gehostet wird. Bei der Verwendung solcher Datensätze für Forschungs- und Entwicklungszwecke unternehmen wir keinerlei Versuche, die in diesem Material ggf. vorkommenden Personen zu identifizieren.
Apple verwendet personenbezogene Daten, um unsere Dienste bereitzustellen, Ihre Transaktionen zu verarbeiten, mit Ihnen zu kommunizieren, zur Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung sowie zur Einhaltung von Gesetzen. Mit Ihrer Zustimmung können wir personenbezogene Daten auch für andere Zwecke verwenden.
Apple verwendet Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur dann, wenn wir eine gültige gesetzliche Grundlage dafür haben.
Je nach den Umständen kann sich Apple auf Ihre Einwilligung oder die Tatsache verlassen, dass die Verarbeitung erforderlich ist, um einen Vertrag mit Ihnen zu erfüllen, Ihre lebenswichtigen Interessen oder die anderer Personen zu schützen oder Gesetze einzuhalten. Unter Berücksichtigung Ihrer Interessen, Rechte und Erwartungen können wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch verarbeiten, wenn wir der Meinung sind, dass dies in unserem oder dem berechtigten Interesse anderer liegt. Weitere Informationen sind in den produktspezifischen Informationen unserer Produkte und Features wie oben beschrieben eingebettet. Wenn Sie Fragen zur Rechtsgrundlage haben, können Sie sich unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
an den Datenschutzbeauftragten wenden.
Bereitstellung unserer Dienste.
Apple erfasst personenbezogene Daten, die zur Bereitstellung unserer Dienste erforderlich sind. Dazu können personenbezogene Daten gehören, die zur Verbesserung unserer Angebote, für interne Zwecke wie Prüfungen oder Datenanalysen oder zur Problembehebung erfasst werden. Wenn Sie beispielsweise über ein Apple Music Abonnement auf einen Song zugreifen möchten, erfassen wir Daten darüber, welche Songs Sie abspielen, um Ihnen die angeforderten Inhalte zur Verfügung zu stellen, sowie aus Lizenzgründen.
Verarbeitung Ihrer Transaktionen.
Um Transaktionen zu verarbeiten, muss Apple Daten wie Ihren Namen, Kauf- und Zahlungsinformationen erfassen.
Kommunikation mit Ihnen.
Um auf Mitteilungen zu antworten, Sie bezüglich Ihrer Transaktionen oder Ihres Accounts zu kontaktieren, unsere Produkte und Dienste zu vermarkten, andere relevante Informationen bereitzustellen oder Informationen oder Feedback anzufordern. Gelegentlich können wir personenbezogene Daten nutzen, um wichtige Mitteilungen zu versenden, beispielsweise über Käufe oder Änderungen unserer Geschäftsbedingungen und Richtlinien. Weil diese Informationen für die Beziehung zu Apple wichtig sind, kann man den Erhalt dieser wichtigen Mitteilungen möglicherweise nicht ablehnen.
Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung.
Zum Schutz von Einzelpersonen, Mitarbeiter:innen und Apple sowie zum Schutz vor Verlusten und zur Betrugsbekämpfung, einschließlich des Schutzes von Einzelpersonen, Mitarbeiter:innen und Apple zum Nutzen aller unserer Nutzer:innen und der Vorabsondierung oder Vorabprüfung hochgeladener Inhalte auf potenziell illegale Inhalte, einschließlich Materials zur sexuellen Ausbeutung von Kindern.
Für Zwecke der Personalisierung verwendete personenbezogene Daten.
Wenn Sie sich dafür entscheiden, Ihre Dienste oder Mitteilungen zu personalisieren, sofern dies möglich ist, verwendet Apple die von uns erfassten Daten, um Ihnen diese personalisierten Dienste oder Mitteilungen anbieten zu können. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie die entsprechenden Dienste personenbezogene Daten zur Personalisierung Ihrer Erfahrungen nutzen, finden Sie in den Datenschutzinformationen, die Sie bei der erstmaligen Nutzung eines Dienstes erhalten, der Sie um Zustimmung zur Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten bittet. Wir stellen diese Informationen leicht auffindbar zur Verfügung, indem wir sie mit unserem Datenschutzsymbol kennzeichnen; sie sind auch jederzeit auf Ihrem Apple Gerät und online unter
http://apple.com/de/legal/privacy/data
verfügbar.
Einhaltung von Gesetzen.
Zur Einhaltung des geltenden Rechts – zum Beispiel zur Erfüllung von Steuer- oder Meldepflichten oder zur Erfüllung einer rechtmäßigen Regierungsanfrage.
Apple verwendet ohne die Möglichkeit einer menschlichen Überprüfung keine Algorithmen oder kein Profiling, um eine Entscheidung zu treffen, die Sie erheblich beeinträchtigen würde. Gemäß kalifornischem Recht verwendet Apple darüber hinaus keine sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten oder legt diese offen für Zwecke, die von Nutzer:innen verlangen würden, ein Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung auszuüben.
Apple bewahrt personenbezogene Daten nur so lange auf, wie es für die Erfüllung der Zwecke, für die sie erfasst wurden, erforderlich ist, einschließlich wie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie oder in unseren dienstspezifischen Datenschutzhinweisen beschrieben oder wie gesetzlich vorgeschrieben. Wir bewahren personenbezogene Daten so lange wie notwendig auf, um die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und unseren dienstspezifischen Übersichten zum Datenschutz beschriebenen Zwecke zu erfüllen. Bei der Beurteilung der Aufbewahrungsfristen prüfen wir zunächst sorgfältig, ob es notwendig ist, die erfassten personenbezogenen Daten aufzubewahren, und bewahren, falls eine Aufbewahrung erforderlich ist, die personenbezogenen Daten für den kürzesten gesetzlich zulässigen Zeitraum auf.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten an
Apple Partnerunternehmen
,
Dienstleister,
die in unserem Auftrag handeln, an unsere
Partner
,
Entwickler und Herausgeber
, oder andere
in Ihrem Auftrag tätige Parteien weitergeben
. Darüber hinaus gibt Apple personenbezogene Daten nicht an Dritte für deren eigene Marketingzwecke weiter.
Dienstleister.
Apple ist berechtigt, Drittparteien als unsere Dienstleister zu beauftragen und bestimmte Aufgaben in unserem Namen ausführen zu lassen, zum Beispiel Verarbeitung oder Aufbewahrung von Daten einschließlich personenbezogener Daten im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Nutzung unserer Dienste und der Lieferung von Produkten an unsere Kund:innen. Apple Dienstleister sind verpflichtet, personenbezogene Daten in Übereinstimmung mit dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und gemäß unseren Anweisungen zu verarbeiten. Sie dürfen die von uns weitergegebenen personenbezogenen Daten nicht für ihre eigenen Zwecke verwenden und müssen die personenbezogenen Daten löschen oder zurückgeben, sobald sie unseren Auftrag erfüllt haben.
Partner.
Gelegentlich geht Apple Partnerschaften mit Drittanbietern ein, um Dienste oder andere Angebote bereitzustellen. Beispielsweise werden finanzielle Angebote von Apple wie Apple Card und Apple Cash von Apple und unseren Partnern angeboten. Apple verlangt von seinen Partnern, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen.
Von Ihnen abonnierte Entwickler und Herausgeber.
Wenn Sie im App Store oder in Apple News ein Abonnement eines Dritten erwerben, erstellen wir eine für Sie und den Entwickler oder Herausgeber eindeutige Abonnenten-ID. Die Abonnenten-ID kann verwendet werden, um Berichte an den Entwickler oder Herausgeber zu senden, die Informationen über das von Ihnen erworbene Abonnement und Ihr Wohnsitzland enthalten. Wenn Sie alle Ihre Abonnements bei einem bestimmten Entwickler oder Herausgeber kündigen, wird die Abonnenten-ID nach 180 Tagen zurückgesetzt, sofern Sie kein neues Abonnement abschließen. Diese Informationen werden Entwicklern oder Herausgebern bereitgestellt, damit sie einen Überblick über den Stand ihrer Abonnements haben.
Sonstige.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten in Ihrem Auftrag oder mit Ihrer Zustimmung an andere weitergeben, z. B. wenn wir Informationen an Ihren Mobilfunkanbieter weitergeben, um Ihren Account zu aktivieren. Außerdem können wir Daten über Sie offenlegen, wenn wir der Überzeugung sind, dass dies für die nationale Sicherheit, den Gesetzesvollzug oder andere öffentliche Interessen notwendig oder angemessen ist. Wir können auch Daten über Sie offenlegen, wenn es dafür eine gesetzliche Grundlage gibt, wenn wir feststellen, dass die Offenlegung notwendig ist, um unsere Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen durchzusetzen oder unseren Geschäftsbetrieb oder unsere Nutzer:innen zu schützen, oder im Falle einer Umstrukturierung, Fusion oder eines Verkaufs.
Apple verkauft Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht, auch nicht gemäß der Definition von „Verkauf“ in Nevada und Kalifornien. Darüber hinaus „teilt“ Apple Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht gemäß Definition dieses Begriffs in Kalifornien.
Wir bei Apple glauben, dass guter Datenschutz auf hoher Sicherheit beruht. Wir verwenden
administrative, technische und physische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen
, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten unter Berücksichtigung der Art der Daten und der Verarbeitung sowie der Bedrohungen zu schützen. Wir entwickeln diese Sicherheitsvorkehrungen ständig weiter, um den Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu gewährleisten. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in unserem Leitfaden
Sicherheit der Apple Plattformen
.
Apple ist sich der Bedeutung des Schutzes der personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern bewusst. Als Kinder definieren wir
Personen unter 13 Jahren oder einem entsprechenden in Ihrer Rechtsordnung gesetzlich festgelegten Alter
. Aus diesem Grund hat Apple zusätzliche Verfahren und Schutzmaßnahmen implementiert, um die personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern zu schützen.
Um auf bestimmte Apple Dienste zugreifen zu können, muss ein Kind einen Apple Account besitzen. Ein Apple Account für ein Kind kann durch einen
Elternteil
oder, im Falle eines verwalteten Apple Accounts, durch die
Bildungseinrichtung des Kindes
erstellt werden.
Eltern.
Um einen Kinderaccount zu erstellen, müssen Eltern die
Informationen unter Familien-Datenschutzauskunft für Kinder
lesen. Darin wird beschrieben, wie Apple mit den personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern umgeht. Bei Zustimmung muss ein Elternteil Apple eine nachprüfbare elterliche Zustimmung vorlegen.
Bildungseinrichtungen.
Bildungseinrichtungen, die am Apple School Manager Programm teilnehmen, können auch Apple Accounts für Lernende erstellen, sogenannte „verwaltete Apple Accounts“. Diese Einrichtungen müssen der Vereinbarung
Verwaltete Apple Accounts für Lernende
zustimmen, die als Anhang A des Apple School Manager Vertrags enthalten ist.
Wenn wir erfahren, dass die personenbezogenen Daten eines Kindes ohne entsprechende Genehmigung erfasst wurden, werden sie schnellstmöglich gelöscht.
Um von Ihren Datenschutzrechten für die Informationen Ihres Kindes Gebrauch zu machen, besuchen Sie die Apple Seite für Daten und Datenschutz unter
privacy.apple.com
, und melden Sie sich beim Account des Kindes an.
Auf den Websites, in Onlinediensten, interaktiven Anwendungen und Werbematerialien von Apple werden möglicherweise
„Cookies“ und andere Technologien
wie etwa Webbeacons verwendet.
Diese Technologien erlauben uns, das Nutzerverhalten, u. a. für Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung, besser zu verstehen, informieren uns, welche Teile unserer Websites besucht wurden und vereinfachen und messen die Effizienz von Werbung und der Websuchen.
Kommunikations-Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden verwendet, um den Netzwerkverkehr von und zu den Systemen von Apple zu ermöglichen, einschließlich des Erkennens etwaiger Fehler.
Absolut notwendige Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden bei Bedarf gesetzt, um eine bestimmte Funktion oder einen bestimmten Dienst bereitzustellen, auf die/den Sie zugegriffen oder die/den Sie angefordert haben. Sie ermöglichen es uns zum Beispiel, unsere Websites im richtigen Format und in der richtigen Sprache anzuzeigen, Ihre Transaktionen zu authentifizieren und zu verifizieren und den Inhalt Ihres Einkaufswagens zu speichern, wenn Sie online auf
apple.com/de
einkaufen.
Sonstige Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden verwendet, um zu verstehen, wie Besucher:innen mit unseren Websites und Online-Diensten interagieren, u. a. indem sie uns helfen, die Wirksamkeit von Werbung und Websuchen zu beurteilen. Apple verwendet diese Cookies auch, um die von Ihnen beim Browsen getroffenen Entscheidungen zu speichern, damit wir Ihnen ein individuelles Erlebnis bieten können.
Wenn Sie es vorziehen, dass Apple keine Cookies verwendet, haben Sie die Möglichkeit, deren Verwendung zu deaktivieren. Wenn Sie Cookies deaktivieren möchten und den Webbrowser Safari verwenden, wählen Sie in den Datenschutzeinstellungen von Safari „Alle Cookies blockieren“. Wenn Sie einen anderen Browser verwenden, können Sie sich bei Ihrem Anbieter erkundigen, wie sich Cookies deaktivieren lassen. Bestimmte Funktionen der Apple Website sind möglicherweise nicht verfügbar, wenn alle Cookies deaktiviert sind.
Zusätzlich zu Cookies verwendet Apple andere Technologien, die uns helfen, ähnliche Ziele zu erreichen.
In einigen E-Mail-Nachrichten, die Apple an Sie sendet, geben wir eine „Click-through-URL“ an, über die Sie auf Inhalte auf der Apple Website weitergeleitet werden. Wenn Sie auf diese URLs klicken, werden Sie durch einen separaten Webserver geleitet, bevor Sie zur Zielseite auf unserer Website gelangen. Wir verfolgen diesen „Click-through“, um das Interesse an bestimmten Themen zu ermitteln und zu messen, ob wir effektiv mit Ihnen kommunizieren. Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass solche Daten erfasst und nachverfolgt werden, klicken Sie in E-Mails nicht auf Grafik- oder Text-Links.
Apple behandelt Daten, die wir mit diesen Cookies und ähnlichen Technologien erfassen, im Allgemeinen als nicht personenbezogene Daten.
In dem Ausmaß, zu dem Internet-Protokolladressen (IP-Adressen) oder ähnliche Identifizierungsmerkmale durch anwendbares Recht als personenbezogene Daten eingestuft werden, behandeln wir diese Identifizierungsmerkmale ebenfalls als personenbezogene Daten. Darüber hinaus kombiniert Apple manchmal nicht personenbezogene Daten, die mit diesen Technologien erfasst wurden, mit anderen personenbezogenen Daten, die Apple aufbewahrt. Wenn wir Daten auf diese Weise kombinieren, behandeln wir die kombinierten Daten für die Zwecke dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie als personenbezogene Daten.
Anzeigen, die über die Werbeplattform von Apple bereitgestellt werden, können in App Store, in Apple News, in der App „Aktien“ und in der Apple TV App angezeigt werden. Die Werbeplattform von Apple verfolgt Sie nicht, was bedeutet, dass sie keine Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten, die von unseren Apps erfasst wurden, mit Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten verknüpft, die von Dritten für zielgerichtete Werbe- oder Werbemessungszwecke erfasst wurden, und keine Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten an Datenvermittler weitergibt.
Wenn Sie in diesen Apps keine auf Ihre Interessen zugeschnittene Werbung von der Apple Werbeplattform erhalten möchten, können Sie „Personalisierte Werbung“ deaktivieren. Damit deaktivieren Sie derartige Werbung für Ihren Apple Account – unabhängig vom verwendeten Gerät. Auf Ihrem iOS, iPadOS oder visionOS Gerät können Sie „Personalisierte Werbung“ deaktivieren, indem Sie „Einstellungen“ > „Datenschutz & Sicherheit“ > „Apple Werbung“ wählen und auf „Personalisierte Werbung“ tippen, um sie zu deaktivieren. Auf Ihrem Mac können Sie „Personalisierte Werbung“ deaktivieren, indem Sie „Systemeinstellungen“ > „Datenschutz & Sicherheit“ > „Datenschutz“ > „Werbung“ wählen und auf „Personalisierte Werbung“ tippen, um sie zu deaktivieren. Sie sehen unter Umständen dennoch kontextbasierte Werbung im App Store oder bei Apple News und Aktien auf der Basis Ihrer Suchanfrage oder des Channels, den Sie lesen. Wenn Sie „Apps erlauben, Tracking anzufordern“ deaktivieren, können Apps von Drittanbietern nicht auf die Anzeigenkennung zugreifen (eine nicht personenbezogene Kennung, die vom Betriebssystem auf Ihrem Gerät bereitgestellt wird), um Sie über Apps und Websites anderer Unternehmen nachzuverfolgen.
Weitere Informationen zur von Apple bereitgestellten Werbung und zum Datenschutz finden Sie unter
apple.com/legal/privacy/data/de/apple-advertising
.
Die Produkte und Angebote von Apple verbinden Sie mit der Welt. Um dies zu ermöglichen,
können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Einrichtungen auf der ganzen Welt,
einschließlich Apple Partnerunternehmen, übertragen oder von diesen eingesehen werden, um Verarbeitungsaktivitäten durchzuführen, wie sie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie in Verbindung mit Ihrer Nutzung unserer Produkte und Dienste beschrieben werden. Apple hält sich an die Gesetze zur Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten zwischen Ländern, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Daten an jedem Ort stets geschützt sind.
Der Apple Rechtsträger, der Ihre personenbezogenen Daten kontrolliert, kann je nach Ihrem Wohnort variieren.
Beispielsweise werden Apple Store Informationen von einzelnen Retail Einrichtungen in jedem Land kontrolliert und personenbezogene Daten in Bezug auf Apple Media Services können, wie in den Servicebedingungen angegeben, von verschiedenen Apple Rechtsträgern kontrolliert werden. Wenn Sie nicht in den USA leben, können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten von Apple Inc. und anderen Apple Partnerunternehmen im Auftrag des Apple Rechtsträgers verarbeitet werden, der die personenbezogenen Daten für Ihre Gerichtsbarkeit kontrolliert. Beispielsweise werden Bilder und zugehörige Daten, die Apple weltweit erfasst, um Apple Karten zu verbessern und unsere Funktion „Umsehen“ zu unterstützen, an Apple Inc. in Kalifornien übertragen.
Personenbezogene Daten, die sich auf Einzelpersonen im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum, in Großbritannien und der Schweiz beziehen, werden von Apple Distribution International Limited in Irland kontrolliert. Die internationale Übermittlung von personenbezogenen Daten, die im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum, in Großbritannien und der Schweiz erfasst werden, durch Apple wird durch die
Standardvertragsklauseln
geregelt. Wenn Sie Fragen haben oder ein Exemplar der Apple Standardvertragsklauseln haben möchten, wenden Sie sich an
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
.
Personenbezogene Daten, die von
Apple oder einem Apple Partnerunternehmen
weltweit erfasst werden, werden in der Regel von Apple Inc. In den USA gespeichert. Unabhängig davon, wo Ihre personenbezogenen Daten gespeichert sind, sorgt Apple stets für das gleiche hohe Maß an Schutz und Schutzmaßnahmen.
Die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebenen Datenschutzpraktiken von Apple entsprechen dem Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs)-System und dem Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP)-System. Weitere Informationen zu diesen beiden Systemen
finden Sie hier
. Um unsere Zertifizierungen einzusehen, besuchen Sie das
Verzeichnis zur CBPR-System-Compliance
. Wenn Sie weitere Informationen zum Umfang unserer Teilnahme abrufen oder eine Datenschutzanfrage über unseren Accountability Agent
BBB National Programs
senden möchten, rufen Sie diese Seiten auf:
Cross-Border Privacy Rules-Programm
Privacy Recognition for Processors-Programm
Personenbezogene Daten von Personen in der Volksrepublik China können von Apple in Ländern außerhalb der Volksrepublik China verarbeitet werden, wie Apple Inc. in den USA oder Apple Distribution International Limited in der Republik Irland. Wo dies der Fall ist, geschieht dies in Übereinstimmung mit den örtlichen Gesetzen, einschließlich des Gesetzes zum Schutz personenbezogener Daten. Für die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie dargelegten Zwecke der Verarbeitung kann Apple solche personenbezogenen Daten auch an externe Dienstanbieter übertragen, die die Daten wiederum außerhalb der Volksrepublik China speichern oder übertragen können. Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter
Datenschutzangaben für Festlandchina
.
Damit die Sicherheit personenbezogener Daten gewährleistet ist, werden unsere Richtlinien über die Persönlichkeitsrechte und Sicherheitsvorkehrungen allen Mitarbeiter:innen von Apple bekannt gegeben und die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zum Schutz der Persönlichkeitsrechte innerhalb des Unternehmens streng umgesetzt.
Wenn Sie Fragen zur Apple Datenschutzrichtlinie oder zu den Datenschutzpraktiken von Apple haben, einschließlich der Fälle, in denen ein Drittanbieter in unserem Namen handelt, oder unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten kontaktieren möchten, können Sie uns unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
erreichen oder die
Apple Support-Telefonnummer
für Ihr Land oder Ihre Region anrufen.
Sie können uns auch Fragen dazu stellen, wie Sie eine Datenschutzbeschwerde einreichen können, und wir werden unser Möglichstes tun, um Ihnen zu helfen.
Apple nimmt Ihre Fragen zum Datenschutz ernst. Ein kompetentes Team prüft Ihre Anfrage, um festzustellen, wie Ihre Frage oder Ihr Anliegen am besten beantwortet werden kann, einschließlich jener Anfragen, die als Antwort auf eine Zugriffs- oder Downloadanfrage eingehen. In den meisten Fällen erhalten alle wesentlichen Kontaktanfragen innerhalb von sieben Tagen eine Antwort. In anderen Fällen benötigen wir möglicherweise zusätzliche Informationen oder teilen Ihnen mit, dass unsere Antwort mehr Zeit in Anspruch nimmt.
Wenn Sie in Ihrer Beschwerde darauf hinweisen, dass wir den Umgang mit Datenschutzthemen verbessern könnten, werden wir entsprechende Schritte unternehmen, um dies bei der nächstmöglichen Gelegenheit umzusetzen. Falls sich ein Problem mit dem Datenschutz negativ auf Sie oder eine andere Person ausgewirkt hat, werden wir entsprechende Schritte unternehmen, um das Problem für Sie oder die andere Person zu lösen.
Sie können jederzeit – auch wenn Sie mit der Antwort von Apple nicht zufrieden sind – Ihre Beschwerde an die zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde weiterleiten. Auf Ihre Anfrage hin versuchen wir Ihnen Informationen darüber bereitzustellen, welche Beschwerdewege Ihnen in Ihrem Fall zur Verfügung stehen.
Bei einer wesentlichen Änderung an dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie werden wir mindestens eine Woche im Voraus eine Mitteilung auf dieser Website veröffentlichen und Sie direkt über die Änderung informieren, wenn uns Ihre Daten vorliegen.

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms

, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information

Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.

similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
Depending on the data protection laws applicable to you, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data that we process as a data controller:
that we provide details about the categories of personal data that we collect about you, including how we collect and share it;
that we provide you access to, and a copy of, the personal data we collect about you;
that we update or correct any inaccurate personal data we have about you;
that we delete the personal data we have about you;
that we restrict processing of personal data about you;
that we provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit that information to another controller, and where feasible, transmit the information directly;

that we provide you with a free, easy mechanism to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes;
that you not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects or similarly affects your individual rights;
to withdraw your consent; and

Twilio will honor your rights subject to limitations in certain situations, such as where Twilio can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement or legitimate interest to process your data or can legitimately apply an exemption to the exercise of a right under applicable law. More information about these rights can be found in our Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy
Rule 10
and
Appendix 3
.
If you are a
US resident
interested in what personal data we have disclosed lately for our business purposes, here’s a list:
Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Privacy Notice or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.
If Twilio processes your personal data as a data processor on behalf of a customer, we will either direct you to contact our customer to exercise your rights.
How To Exercise Your Rights and Choices
The following sections provide information about how to exercise certain rights in relation to your personal data. To exercise any other rights, please contact us at

. Please be aware that closure or deletion of your Twilio account will result in you permanently losing access to your account and the data in the account. After closure of your account, certain information associated with your account may remain on Twilio’s servers in an aggregated form that does not identify you. Similarly, after you close your account, we will retain data — including personal data — associated with your account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations (see “
How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification
In some instances, we will need to verify your identity before honoring your request. We will generally verify your identity by asking you to provide personal data related to your recent interactions with us. Thereafter, we will process your request and inform you of any decisions we have made about your request.  Additionally, you may exercise your privacy rights through an authorized agent. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
.
We won’t discriminate against you or change the price of our services if you make a request, but if you ask us to delete your data, it may affect your ability to use our Services.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)

CPNI
. To opt-out of the use of CPNI data related to your Twilio account to market other Twilio Services based on your usage of our Services, click
here
.  Please note that, if you have subscribed for the services on behalf of an organization, the CPNI relates to the service usage by that organization and not you individually.

Your approval or opt-out of the use of your CPNI outside of the services to which you are already subscribed is valid until you affirmatively revoke or limit such approval.

How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Twilio uses common information gathering tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels and other similar tracking technologies to automatically collect information as you navigate our websites, your account or when you interact with emails we send to you.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your browser or elsewhere on your hard drive. Cookies allow Twilio to identify your device as you navigate our websites or your account. This makes navigating and interacting with our websites or your account more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.
Twilio uses both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies are cookies that disappear from your computer or browser when you turn off your computer. Persistent cookies stay on your computer even after you’ve turned it off.

If you believe an underage person has signed up for a Twilio account, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
with the subject line “Children”.
Automated Decision Making
Automated decision-making occurs when an electronic system uses personal data to make a decision about you, without human involvement. Twilio uses automated decision-making leveraging a variety of signals derived from records we collect or obtain from third party vendors, to help monitor, identify, and suspend accounts sending spam or engaging in other abusive or fraudulent activity.  We may also use this information to evaluate your account application and make decisions about whether to approve or decline. If your account is suspended or not approved under these circumstances you will be notified and given an opportunity to request human review of the decision.
We may rely on other automated decision-making where:
We have notified you of the decision and provided you with the opportunity to request a human review of the decision
It is necessary to perform a contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights
We have your consent and we have put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s
documentation
and Segment’s
documentation
to find more detailed information about managing personal data collected and stored in connection with their use of our Services. We also provide an overview of our retention and deletion practices, including how to delete data you control in our
support documentation
. We provide information about the security measures we use to protect our customer’s data  in our
Security Overview
, and if you are located in a country that requires you to obtain information about our supplemental measures, you may read more about those measures
here
.
For some of the Services we also act as a data controller where disclosed and agreed to by our customer in the agreement, Data Protection Addendum, product specific terms or via the customers’ use and configuration of a product or feature.As a data controller, Twilio is responsible for the processing of the personal data.
For more detail on our Services, please find information below or by visiting our
products page
.
Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

This includes information such as the number of phone calls, call destinations, call locations, type, and service configuration, and is known as Customer Proprietary Network Information ('CPNI').

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
Depending on the data protection laws applicable to you, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data that we process as a data controller:
that we provide details about the categories of personal data that we collect about you, including how we collect and share it;
that we provide you access to, and a copy of, the personal data we collect about you;
that we update or correct any inaccurate personal data we have about you;
that we delete the personal data we have about you;
that we restrict processing of personal data about you;
that we provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit that information to another controller, and where feasible, transmit the information directly;
that we provide you with the right to object to the processing of personal data, including profiling;
that we provide you with a free, easy mechanism to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes;
that you not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects or similarly affects your individual rights;
to withdraw your consent; and
to complain to a competent supervisory authority and/or to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Twilio will honor your rights subject to limitations in certain situations, such as where Twilio can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement or legitimate interest to process your data or can legitimately apply an exemption to the exercise of a right under applicable law. More information about these rights can be found in our Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy
Rule 10
and
Appendix 3

If you are a
US resident
interested in what personal data we have disclosed lately for our business purposes, here’s a list:
Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Privacy Notice or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.
If Twilio processes your personal data as a data processor on behalf of a customer, we will either direct you to contact our customer to exercise your rights.
How To Exercise Your Rights and Choices
The following sections provide information about how to exercise certain rights in relation to your personal data. To exercise any other rights, please contact us at

Customer Support

Similarly, after you close your account, we will retain data — including personal data — associated with your account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations (see “
How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification
In some instances, we will need to verify your identity before honoring your request. We will generally verify your identity by asking you to provide personal data related to your recent interactions with us. Thereafter, we will process your request and inform you of any decisions we have made about your request.  Additionally, you may exercise your privacy rights through an authorized agent. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
.
We won’t discriminate against you or change the price of our services if you make a request, but if you ask us to delete your data, it may affect your ability to use our Services.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)

CPNI

Cookies

Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of data on your computer, like when you view a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. Additionally, we may put web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to a Twilio website.
Children
Our Services are not directed to or intended to be used by children (under the age of 13 in the US and UK, or 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly permit children to sign up for a Twilio account. If we become aware that a child has signed up for an account, we will take reasonable steps to deactivate the account and remove their personal data from our records as quickly as possible. If you believe an underage person has signed up for a Twilio account, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
with the subject line “Children”.
Automated Decision Making
Automated decision-making occurs when an electronic system uses personal data to make a decision about you, without human involvement. Twilio uses automated decision-making leveraging a variety of signals derived from records we collect or obtain from third party vendors, to help monitor, identify, and suspend accounts sending spam or engaging in other abusive or fraudulent activity.  We may also use this information to evaluate your account application and make decisions about whether to approve or decline. If your account is suspended or not approved under these circumstances you will be notified and given an opportunity to request human review of the decision.
We may rely on other automated decision-making where:
We have notified you of the decision and provided you with the opportunity to request a human review of the decision
It is necessary to perform a contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights
We have your consent and we have put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s
documentation
and Segment’s
documentation
to find more detailed information about managing personal data collected and stored in connection with their use of our Services. We also provide an overview of our retention and deletion practices, including how to delete data you control in our
support documentation
. We provide information about the security measures we use to protect our customer’s data  in our
Security Overview
, and if you are located in a country that requires you to obtain information about our supplemental measures, you may read more about those measures

For some of the Services we also act as a data controller where disclosed and agreed to by our customer in the agreement, Data Protection Addendum, product specific terms or via the customers’ use and configuration of a product or feature.As a data controller, Twilio is responsible for the processing of the personal data.
For more detail on our Services, please find information below or by visiting our
products page

Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

Dieser Vertrag wird lediglich als Gefälligkeit zur Verfügung gestellt. Es gilt ausschließlich die englische Fassung dieses Vertrags, und in keinem Fall darf die deutsche Sprachfassung dieses Vertrags dahingehend ausgelegt werden, dass sie die englische Fassung dieses Vertrags ändert oder auf andere Weise die Beziehung der Vertragspartner untereinander regelt.
HubSpot verpflichtet sich, Ihre Privatsphäre zu schützen. Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt für die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir im Rahmen unserer Geschäftstätigkeit erheben und verarbeiten. HubSpot geht bei der Datenverarbeitung unterschiedlich vor:
(i) HubSpot fungiert als Verantwortlicher für Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, wenn Sie sich für unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen anmelden, unsere Websites besuchen oder über andere Kanäle (z. B. bei persönlichen Events) mit uns interagieren. Wir verwenden diese Daten für verschiedene Zwecke, unter anderem, um Ihnen unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen, Sie bezüglich relevanter Inhalte zu kontaktieren und unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern und zu bewerben.
(ii) HubSpot fungiert als Auftragsverarbeiter, wenn unsere Kunden unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen nutzen, um personenbezogene Daten im Zusammenhang mit ihren Vertriebs-, Marketing- und anderen Geschäftsaktivitäten zu erheben und zu verarbeiten. In diesem Fall handeln wir als Auftragsverarbeiter (oder Dienstanbieter) im Auftrag unserer Kunden (die für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verantwortlich sind) gemäß der
Vereinbarung zur Datenverarbeitung von HubSpot
, die in den
HubSpot-Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
enthalten ist.
(iii) HubSpot fungiert auch als Verantwortlicher, wenn wir personenbezogene Daten über Personen in ihrer beruflichen Eigenschaft erheben und verarbeiten und diese Informationen Kunden für ihre eigenen Vertriebs-, Marketing- und sonstigen Geschäftsaktivitäten zur Verfügung stellen. Dies umfasst personenbezogene Daten, die wir indirekt über Sie erheben, z. B. aus öffentlich zugänglichen Quellen, von unseren Kunden oder von anderen Dritten. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt „Von uns erfasste und verarbeitete Informationen“.
Für die Zwecke dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie steht „personenbezogene Daten“ für jegliche Art von Informationen zu einer identifizierten oder identifizierbaren Person. Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie beschreibt Ihre Wahlmöglichkeiten und Rechte betreffend Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, einschließlich Ihrer Rechte hinsichtlich der Korrektur und des Zugriffs.
(i) Informationen darüber, wie Sie Ihre Datenschutzrechte ausüben können, wenn HubSpot als Verantwortlicher für personenbezogene Daten fungiert, finden Sie im Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“.
(ii) Um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz von Fachleuten zu löschen, füllen Sie bitte dieses Formular aus.
(iii) Wenn Sie Ihre Datenschutzrechte in Bezug auf personenbezogene Daten, die wir im Auftrag eines Kunden verarbeiten, ausüben möchten, lesen Sie bitte die Kundenrichtlinien und wenden Sie sich direkt an den Kunden.
Wir aktualisieren diese Datenschutzrichtlinie von Zeit zu Zeit und empfehlen Ihnen, sie regelmäßig durchzulesen. Wir werden alle Änderungen der Datenschutzrichtlinien auf dieser Seite veröffentlichen und Sie, falls die Änderungen wesentlich sind, direkt benachrichtigen (z. B. indem wir Ihnen eine E-Mail-Benachrichtigung senden). Alle Begriffe, sofern in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie nicht anders definiert, haben die in den
HubSpot-Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden

Wir erfassen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, wenn Sie Webformulare übermitteln oder mit unserer Website interagieren, z. B. wenn Sie einen HubSpot-Blog abonnieren, sich für ein Webinar anmelden, eine unserer Dienstleistungen abonnieren oder den Kundenservice um Unterstützung bitten. Wir können Sie nach Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse, Ihrem Vor- und Nachnamen, Ihrer Berufsbezeichnung und anderen ähnlichen geschäftlichen Informationen fragen. Es steht Ihnen frei, manche unserer Websites zu besuchen, ohne dabei personenbezogene Daten mit uns zu teilen.

Wir können Sie zum Beispiel bitten, eine Rechnungsadresse oder einen Rechnungskontakt für Ihren HubSpot-Account anzugeben.

Wir setzen sichere Drittanbieter für die Zahlungsabwicklung ein, die über einen sicheren Zahlungsprozess eingezogen wird.
1.1.5 Testimonials. Wir veröffentlichen Testimonials und Kommentare auf unseren Websites, welche personenbezogene Daten enthalten können.
1.2 Daten, die wir im Namen von Kunden verarbeiten, wenn diese den Abonnementdienst nutzen.
Mit unserem Produkt (bzw. dem Abonnementdienst) können unsere Benutzer Inhalte für Marketing, Vertrieb und den Kundendienst erstellen und teilen. Im Rahmen ihrer Nutzung unseres Produktes können unsere Kunden personenbezogene Daten wie Vor- und Nachnamen, E-Mail-Adressen, Postadressen oder Telefonnummern verarbeiten. Die Informationen, die unsere Kunden über das Produkt übermitteln oder erheben, bezeichnen wir gemäß unseren
Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
als „Kundendaten“.
In der Regel speichern und verarbeiten wir Informationen über und im Namen unserer Kunden auf unseren Servern als Auftragsverarbeiter (oder Dienstanbieter) auf der Grundlage der Anweisungen eines Kunden und in Übereinstimmung mit unseren
HubSpot-Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
.  Jeder Kunde kontrolliert und ist verantwortlich für die Informationen, die er mit einem Abonnementdienst verarbeitet, sowie für die Einhaltung von Vorschriften oder Gesetzen, die eine Benachrichtigung, Offenlegung und/oder Einholung der Zustimmung vor der Übermittlung der personenbezogenen Daten an HubSpot zu Verarbeitungszwecken vorschreiben.
Wenn Sie Fragen zu den personenbezogenen Daten haben, die wir im Auftrag eines Kunden verarbeiten, wenden Sie sich bitte direkt an den Kunden und lesen Sie dessen Richtlinien.
1.3 Daten, die wir sammeln und verarbeiten, wenn Sie den Abonnementdienst nutzen.
1.3.1 Nutzungsdaten. Wir erfassen Nutzungsdaten, wenn Sie oder Ihre Benutzer über Ihren HubSpot-Account mit dem Abonnementdienst interagieren. Zu den Nutzungsdaten gehören Kennzahlen und Informationen über Ihre Nutzung und Interaktion mit dem Abonnementdienst, z. B. welche Produktfunktionen Sie am häufigsten nutzen, wann ein Objekt (z. B. ein Ticket) geöffnet und geschlossen wird und wie oft bestimmte Funktionen (z. B. Workflows) in Ihrem Account ausgelöst werden.
Wir beauftragen Drittanbieter mit der Erhebung von Nutzungsdaten. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie wir Ihre Daten im Rahmen der Zusammenarbeit mit diesen Dienstleistern schützen, finden Sie im Abschnitt „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten teilen“.
1.3.2 Mobilgeräte. Wenn Sie über unsere mobilen Apps auf den Abonnementdienst zugreifen, erfassen wir automatisch Daten wie Modell, Version und IDs Ihres Geräts sowie die Version des Betriebssystems.
1.3.3 Protokolldateien. Wie die meisten Websites und Technologiedienste, die über das Internet bereitgestellt werden, erfassen und speichern wir automatisch Informationen über Ihre Computerhardware und -software, wenn Sie unsere Websites besuchen, unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen nutzen oder andere Websites oder Dienstleistungen aufrufen, die einen Link zu dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie enthalten. Diese Daten können Ihre IP-Adresse umfassen, den Browsertyp, Domain-Namen, den Internet-Service-Provider (ISP) und die auf unserer Website angesehenen Dateien (z. B. HTML-Seiten und Grafiken), die auf den Websites unserer Kunden angesehenen Dateien (falls diese Websites über HubSpot gehostet werden, z. B. HTML-Seiten und Grafiken etc.), Ihr Betriebssystem, Zugriffszeiten und Adressen von Websites, über die Sie auf unsere Website gelangt sind.
Wenn Sie den Abonnementdienst nutzen, erfassen und speichern wir in den folgenden Fällen und vorbehaltlich der Implementierungseinstellungen des Kunden die oben aufgeführten Arten von Informationen in Protokollen:
(i) wenn sich ein HubSpot-Benutzer bei seinem Account anmeldet und auf Tools auf der Plattform von HubSpot zugreift;
(ii) wenn eine Person die Website eines Kunden besucht, sofern die Website über unser Produkt oder unsere Dienste gehostet wird; oder
(iii) wenn eine Person die Website eines Kunden besucht, sofern die Website des Kunden selbstgehostet ist, wenn der Kunde unsere Plug-ins verwendet und wenn der Kunde HubSpot-Skripte und -Content (wie eingebettete Formulare) nutzt; oder
(iv) Funktionen und Inhalte von Drittanbietern und anderen Unternehmen.
Unsere Websites können Funktionen und Widgets enthalten (z. B. die Schaltfläche zum Teilen und für „Gefällt mir“-Angaben oder interaktive Miniprogramme), die auf unseren Websites ausgeführt werden. Diese Funktionen können Ihre IP-Adresse und die von Ihnen auf unseren Websites besuchten Seiten erfassen und sie können ein Cookie setzen, um die korrekte Ausführung der Funktion zu ermöglichen. Derartige Funktionen und Widgets werden entweder von Dritten oder direkt auf unseren Websites gehostet.
1.3.4 Integrationen mit Dritten.
Sie können Ihren HubSpot-Account mit Integrationen von Dritten verbinden, die möglicherweise bestimmte Berechtigungen für den Zugriff auf Daten oder das Senden von Daten an Ihren HubSpot-Account verlangen. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, alle von Ihnen genehmigten Integrationen von Dritten zu überprüfen. Wir können Informationen darüber sammeln, welche Integrationen Sie in Ihrem HubSpot-Account nutzen.
Die von Ihnen erteilte(n) Genehmigung(en) gewährt/gewähren diesen Dritten Zugriff auf Ihre Daten, was unter anderem bedeuten kann, dass Drittanbieteranwendungen Zugriff auf die Daten Ihres HubSpot-Accounts erhalten, diese speichern und ändern können.  Wir sind nicht für die Praktiken von Drittanbieterintegrationen verantwortlich. Bitte prüfen Sie daher sorgfältig die Berechtigungen, die Sie Anwendungen von Drittanbietern gewähren.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Weitere Informationen über Integrationen mit Drittanbietern finden Sie in folgendem Artikel der Wissensdatenbank:
Apps mit HubSpot verknüpfen
.
1.4 Von uns erfasste Daten aus anderen Quellen.
1.4.1 HubSpot-Partner. Wir können Daten über Sie oder andere Benutzer Ihres HubSpot-Accounts (falls zutreffend) von unserem globalen Partnernetzwerk erhalten. Wir können diese Daten auf verschiedene Weise erhalten, u. a. durch unsere Geschäfts- und Lead-Registrierungsprozesse.
Wir können auch Daten über Sie über unsere Co-Marketing-Vereinbarungen mit Partnern einholen. Sie könnten sich zum Beispiel für ein Webinar anmelden oder ein von HubSpot und einem seiner Co-Marketing-Partner veröffentlichtes Whitepaper herunterladen. Weitere Informationen zu unserem Co-Marketing-Programm finden Sie unter https://www.hubspot.com/co-marketing-request-form. Weitere Informationen über die Weitergabe von Daten an unsere Partner finden Sie im Unterabschnitt „Partner“ des Punkts „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten teilen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie.

Dazu gehören Postadressen, Jobbezeichnungen, E-Mail-Adressen, Telefonnummern, IP-Adressen und Social-Media-Profile. Dies hilft uns, unsere Produkte, Dienstleistungen und Aufzeichnungen zu aktualisieren und zu verbessern, neue Kunden zu identifizieren, personalisierte Werbung zu erstellen, Produkte und Dienstleistungen vorzuschlagen, die Sie interessieren könnten, personalisierte Mitteilungen zu versenden und Events zu bewerben.
1.4.4 Andere HubSpot-Unternehmen und Affiliate-Partner. Wir können Daten über Sie von anderen Unternehmen erhalten, die sich im Besitz von HubSpot befinden oder von HubSpot betrieben werden.
1.5 Daten, die wir in Verbindung mit unseren Anreicherungsprodukten sammeln und verarbeiten. HubSpot sammelt Geschäftskontaktdaten und ähnliche berufliche Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen, einschließlich öffentlich zugänglicher Quellen, Drittanbietern und Kunden, die unsere Anreicherungsprodukte verwenden. Diese Informationen bilden die Grundlage für unseren kommerziellen Datensatz. Wir stellen Informationen aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz Kunden zur Verfügung, die sich für die Nutzung von Anreicherungsprodukten innerhalb der Abonnementdienste als Teil ihrer Verkaufs-, Marketing- und anderen Geschäftsaktivitäten entscheiden.
Wenn Sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz entfernen möchten, füllen Sie

HubSpot verwendet die durch den Tracking-Code gesammelten Daten, wie IP-Adressen und Online-Kennungen, um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern, einschließlich unseres kommerziellen Datensatzes.

. WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN VERWENDEN
2.1 Um mit Ihnen über das Produkt und die Dienstleistungen zu kommunizieren. Wir verwenden die Accountdaten, die Sie HubSpot bei der Anmeldung für unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung stellen, um Ihnen Transaktions-E-Mails oder In-App-Benachrichtigungen über die Rechnungsstellung, die Accountverwaltung und andere administrative Angelegenheiten zu senden.
Wir verwenden Ihre Daten auch, um Ihnen neue Produkte und Services zu empfehlen und für den Kundenservice, z. B. zur Lösung von technischen Problemen und zur Analyse von Produktausfällen oder Fehlern.
Wenn Sie die Mobile-Apps von HubSpot verwenden, können wir Ihnen gelegentlich Push-Benachrichtigungen senden, um Sie über aktuelle Ereignisse oder Promotions zu informieren. Wenn Sie diese Mitteilungen nicht mehr erhalten möchten, können Sie diese auf Ihrem Gerät deaktivieren.
2.2 Zur Bereitstellung des Abonnementdienstes. Wir verwenden Ihre Account- und Kundendaten, um Ihnen das Produkt und die Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Zum Beispiel verwenden wir die E-Mail-Adresse, die Sie bei der Registrierung angeben, um Ihren Account zu erstellen, und wir verwenden Ihre Zahlungsinformationen, um Zahlungen für die kostenpflichtige Nutzung des Abonnementdienstes zu verarbeiten. Wir nutzen diese Informationen auch, um Sie bei der Anmeldung zu authentifizieren, und für den Kundenservice.
2.3 Um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern und weiterzuentwickeln. Wir verwenden Berufsdaten, Protokolldateien und Nutzungsdaten darüber, wie Sie oder Ihre Benutzer mit unseren Produkten und Dienstleistungen interagieren, um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu entwickeln und zu verbessern. So verwenden wir beispielsweise Nutzungsdaten, um Trends und die Nutzung des Produkts zu bewerten und um festzustellen, welche neuen Funktionen oder Integrationen für unsere Benutzer von Interesse sein könnten.
Wir können Kundendaten verwenden, um Produktfunktionen und -eigenschaften im Rahmen des Abonnementdienstes und ähnlicher AI-Produkte und Dienstleistungen, die sich auf maschinelle Lernverfahren stützen, zu unterstützen und zu entwickeln. Sie können der Verwendung Ihrer Kundendaten zum Trainieren von HubSpot-Modellen widersprechen, indem Sie eine E-Mail an
privacy@hubspot.com
senden.
Wir können Daten darüber veröffentlichen, wie unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen von unseren Kunden genutzt werden. Wenn wir auf diese Weise statistische Informationen an Dritte weitergeben, werden die Daten aggregiert und wir identifizieren keine einzelnen Benutzer oder Kunden. Wir können zum Beispiel Blogbeiträge über Trends oder Einblicke in die Interaktion der Benutzer mit unserem Produkt veröffentlichen.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Bitte lesen Sie den Artikel
Von der Datennutzung für maschinelles Lernen von HubSpot abmelden
in der Wissensdatenbank, um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie Ihre Kundendaten zum Trainieren von HubSpot-Modellen verwendet werden.
2.4 Zur Sicherung und zum Schutz unseres Produktes und der HubSpot-Benutzer. Wir verwenden Ihre Accountdaten, um Sicherheitsvorfälle zu untersuchen und zu verhindern. Außerdem können wir diese Daten verwenden, um gesetzliche Anforderungen zu erfüllen. Wir nutzen Ihre Daten, um Accounts und neue Produktanmeldungen zu verifizieren und um Produktmissbrauch zu erkennen und zu verhindern. Dazu gehört auch die Durchsetzung unserer
Richtlinie zur akzeptablen Nutzung
.
Wir verwenden Protokolldateien, um allgemeine Statistiken über Ihre Nutzung der Websites zu erstellen, einschließlich der Art und Weise, wie Sie unsere Websites nutzen, um festzustellen, aus welchem Land Sie sich einloggen (für Analytics, zur Exportkontrolle und zu regulatorischen Zwecken) und um die Navigation zu verbessern. Auch Ihre IP-Adressen werden aus Sicherheitsgründen und zur Fehlerbehebung erfasst und protokolliert, zum Beispiel um Zugriffsmuster zu verfolgen und Sicherheitsereignisse und Vorfälle zu untersuchen. Dazu verknüpfen wir diese automatisch erfassten Daten mit anderen personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, wie Namen, E-Mail-Adressen, Adressen und Telefonnummern.
2.5 Um den Abonnementdienst zu vermarkten und zu bewerben. Wir verwenden personenbezogene Daten, um unsere Produkte, Dienstleistungen und anderen Angebote zu bewerben und zu vermarkten. Zum Beispiel nutzen wir die Daten, etwa Ihre physische oder E-Mail-Adresse, um Ihnen per Post, E-Mail oder auf sonstigem Weg Informationen oder HubSpot-Inhalte zu senden, von denen wir glauben, dass sie für Sie von Interesse sein könnten, z. B. per Post, E-Mail oder auf anderem Wege.  Wir können Ihnen auch Marketingnachrichten in Bezug auf unser Geschäft senden.
Sie können sich gegen den Empfang derartiger Werbeinhalte entscheiden. Befolgen Sie dafür einfach die Anleitungen, die in jeder von uns versendeten Mitteilung enthalten sind. Wenn Sie sich von unseren Marketinglisten abmelden, werden wir Sie dennoch weiterhin zu administrativen Zwecken kontaktieren und auf Ihre Anfragen reagieren.
Wir können Sie telefonisch kontaktieren, um Sie über andere HubSpot-Produkte oder -Dienstleistungen zu informieren, die Sie interessieren könnten. Wenn Sie ein Telefongespräch mit einem HubSpot-Mitarbeiter vereinbart haben, können wir das Gespräch aufzeichnen und transkribieren. Sie werden vor dem Telefonat darüber informiert, dass das Gespräch aufgezeichnet wird, und haben die Möglichkeit, die Aufzeichnung abzulehnen.  Wir können Sie auch per SMS kontaktieren, und Sie werden die Möglichkeit haben, sich von diesen Mitteilungen abzumelden.
Sofern gesetzlich zulässig erfolgt der Versand von Marketingkommunikation nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung. Andernfalls bewerben und vermarkten wir unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen auf Basis unserer legitimen Geschäftsinteressen.
Wir können die von Drittanbietern und anderen Quellen gesammelten Daten in Kombination mit anderen Daten, die wir auf andere in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebene Weise sammeln, verwenden, um Ihnen Aktualisierungen und verbesserte Dienste, personalisierte Mitteilungen, Event-Werbung und eine anderweitige Verbesserung der Benutzererfahrung zu bieten.
2.6 Andere Zwecke, wenn wir Ihre Zustimmung erhalten. Wir können Ihre Daten für andere Zwecke verwenden, wenn Sie uns Ihre Zustimmung dazu geben.
2.7 Rechtliche Grundlage für die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten (gilt nur für Besucher aus dem EWR und dem Vereinigten Königreich). Wenn Sie ein Websitebesucher mit Sitz im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR“) oder Vereinigten Königreich („UK“) sind, ist HubSpot Ireland Limited für die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten verantwortlich. Den Datenschutzbeauftragten von HubSpot erreichen Sie
hier
.
Die rechtliche Grundlage für unser Erheben und unsere Verwendung der oben beschriebenen personenbezogenen Daten hängt von den jeweiligen personenbezogenen Daten und dem konkreten Kontext ab, in dem wir diese erheben. Dennoch gilt, dass wir personenbezogene Daten normalerweise nur dann von Ihnen erheben, wenn Sie dem zugestimmt haben, wenn wir die personenbezogenen Daten benötigen, um eine zwischen uns und Ihnen bestehende Vertragsvereinbarung zu erfüllen, oder wenn die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten unseren legitimen Interessen dient und diese nicht gegen Ihre Datenschutzinteressen beziehungsweise gegen Grundrechte verstoßen oder Ihre Freiheiten verletzen. In manchen Fällen kann es auch sein, dass wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind, personenbezogene Daten zu Ihnen einzuholen.
Wenn wir Sie auffordern, personenbezogene Daten zur Verfügung zu stellen, um gesetzliche Auflagen oder eine vertragliche Vereinbarung zwischen uns und Ihnen zu erfüllen, stellen wir dies zum gegebenen Zeitpunkt klar und weisen Sie darauf hin, ob Sie die Angaben machen müssen oder nicht (ebenso weisen wir Sie auf die möglichen Konsequenzen hin, falls Sie die betreffenden Informationen nicht zur Verfügung stellen). Entsprechend gilt, dass wir Sie dann, wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zur Verfolgung unserer legitimen Interessen (oder der legitimen Interessen Dritter) erheben, zum gegebenen Zeitpunkt darüber informieren, um welche legitimen Interessen es sich konkret handelt.

. WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN TEILEN
3.1 Dienstanbieter. Wir können personenbezogene Daten mit Drittanbietern teilen, die die Bereitstellung unserer Websites, Produkte und Dienstleistungen unterstützen. So nutzen wir zum Beispiel Serviceanbieter für das Datenhosting, die Anwendungsentwicklung, das Marketing sowie für den Vertriebs- und Kundensupport. Daher müssen wir Ihre Daten unter Umständen mit Serviceanbietern teilen, um Ihnen Informationen über Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Zu diesen Dienstleistungen gehören unter anderem Folgende: Die Löschung redundanter Daten aus Listen potenzieller Kunden, die Datenanalyse oder statistische Auswertung Ihrer Nutzung des Abonnementdienstes oder Ihrer Website-Interaktionen, die Unterstützung von Marketingtätigkeiten, die Abwicklung von Kreditkartenzahlungen, die Ergänzung Ihrer uns gegenüber gemachten Angaben, um Ihnen einen besseren Service bieten zu können, die Weiterentwicklung und Verbesserung unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen sowie die Erbringung von Kundendienst- und Supportleistungen. Diesen Dienstleistern ist es untersagt, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für andere als die genannten Zwecke zu verwenden, und sie sind verpflichtet, Ihre Daten vertraulich zu behandeln. In allen Fällen, in denen wir Ihre Daten auf diese Weise weitergeben, verpflichten wir den Drittanbieter ausdrücklich zur Bestätigung und Einhaltung unserer Datenschutzrichtlinie und -standards.
3.2 Partner. Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an vertrauenswürdige HubSpot-Partner weitergeben: (i) damit diese Sie auf der Grundlage Ihrer Kommunikationspräferenzen kontaktieren können; (ii) um uns bei der Durchführung statistischer Analysen zu helfen; (iii) um Vertriebsunterstützung zu leisten; (iv) um Kundensupport zu leisten; und (v) um unsere Partnerprogramme und Abonnementdienste zu verbessern. Partnern ist es untersagt, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für andere als die genannten Zwecke zu verwenden, und sie sind verpflichtet, Ihre Daten vertraulich zu behandeln.
Wir unterhalten auch Partnerschaften mit vertrauenswürdigen externen Parteien, um Ihnen Co-Marketing-Inhalte anzubieten, von denen wir glauben, dass Sie Interesse an ihnen haben können. Wenn Sie mit diesen Co-Marketing-Partnern interagieren, informieren wir Sie, mit wem wir Ihre Daten teilen, und wir stellen Ihnen einen Link zur Datenschutzrichtlinie des betreffenden Co-Marketing-Partners zur Verfügung. So können Sie sich über ihre Datenschutzpraktiken informieren und darüber, wie Sie die Mitteilungen des betreffenden Co-Marketing-Partners gegebenenfalls abbestellen können. Sie werden immer die Wahl haben, ob Sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an unsere Co-Marketing-Partner weitergeben möchten. Besagte Co-Marketing-Partner werden von uns angehalten, unsere Datenschutz- und Datensicherheitsrichtlinien zu befolgen. Nähere Informationen zu unserem Co-Marketing-Programm finden Sie auf
dieser Seite
.
3.3 Werbepartner. Wir erlauben Werbenetzwerken, Informationen über Ihre Interaktionen mit unseren Websites zu sammeln, um personalisierte Werbung von HubSpot zu schalten. Wir können personenbezogene Daten, wie z. B. Ihre E-Mail-Adresse, auch an unsere Werbepartner weitergeben, um personalisierte Werbung von HubSpot auf den Websites oder mobilen Apps anderer Unternehmen zu schalten.  Mit diesem
Formular
können Sie der Weitergabe Ihrer Daten an unsere Werbepartner widersprechen.
3.4 Veränderungen der Unternehmensstruktur. Wenn wir (oder unsere Aktiva) von einem anderen Unternehmen erworben werden (durch Fusion, Übernahme, Konkurs oder anderweitig), übernimmt das betreffende Unternehmen sämtliche von HubSpot auf den Websites und über den Abonnementdienst erfassten Informationen. In diesem Fall erhalten Sie eine Benachrichtigung per E-Mail oder es erfolgt eine auffällige Mitteilung auf unserer Website über die Veränderung der Eigentumsverhältnisse und deren Konsequenzen für die Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten und Ihrer Wahlmöglichkeiten bezüglich Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten.
3.5 Öffentliche Foren. Unsere Websites können öffentlich zugängliche Internetforen, Blogs und Community-Foren (z. B. die HubSpot Community, Connect.com usw.) anbieten. Wenn Sie Daten direkt über unsere öffentlichen Internetforen, Blogs oder Foren offenlegen (einschließlich der Profilinformationen des Accounts, über den Sie die Daten veröffentlichen), bedenken Sie bitte, dass diese Daten von jeder Person, die auf diese Websites zugreift, gelesen, erfasst und verwertet werden können. Ihre Beiträge und bestimmte Profilinformationen können auch nach der Kündigung Ihres Accounts erhalten bleiben. Wir bitten Sie, die Vertraulichkeit aller Daten, die Sie auf diese Weise veröffentlichen, zu berücksichtigen. Auf Ihre Anfrage hin berichtigen oder löschen wir Daten, die Sie auf den Websites veröffentlicht haben, wie in Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben. In einigen Fällen sind wir nicht in der Lage, Ihre Daten zu löschen. In diesem Fall werden wir Sie darüber informieren und Ihnen den Grund dafür mitteilen, sofern dies zulässig ist.
3.6 Obligatorische Offenlegung. Wir behalten uns das Recht vor, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu verwenden oder offenzulegen, wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind oder wenn wir der begründeten Ansicht sind, dass die Verwendung oder Offenlegung notwendig ist, um unsere Rechte, Ihre Sicherheit oder die Sicherheit anderer zu schützen, Betrugsfällen nachzugehen oder ein Gesetz, eine gerichtliche Verfügung oder die Auflagen eines rechtlichen Verfahrens zu erfüllen. Wenn Sie den Abonnementdienst nutzen, gelten die Kundendaten als vertrauliche Informationen. Weitere Informationen dazu finden Sie im Abschnitt „Vertraulichkeit“ in den
Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
. HubSpot teilt Daten zu Kundeninformationsanfragen. Mehr dazu erfahren Sie in unserem
Bericht über Datenoffenlegung und Transparenz
.
3.7 HubSpot, andere Unternehmen und Affiliate-Partner. Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an unsere derzeitigen und zukünftigen Muttergesellschaften, Affiliate-Partner, Tochtergesellschaften und andere Unternehmen unter gemeinsamer Kontrolle und in gemeinsamem Besitz weitergeben, soweit dies erforderlich ist, um Ihre Anfrage zu erfüllen oder für andere Zwecke, die gemäß dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie zulässig sind.
3.8 HubSpot-Kunden in Verbindung mit unseren Anreicherungsprodukten. Wir können personenbezogene Daten über Personen in unserem kommerziellen Datenbestand an unsere Kunden weitergeben, die unsere Anreicherungsprodukte verwenden. Kunden können diese Informationen für ihre Verkaufs- und Marketingaktivitäten nutzen. Wir stützen uns auf unsere berechtigten Interessen sowie die unserer Kunden, um Daten für die aufgeführten Zwecke zu sammeln und weiterzugeben. Die berechtigten Interessen von HubSpot und unseren Kunden sind nicht wichtiger als Ihre Datenschutzrechte, und wir verarbeiten Ihre Daten auf der Grundlage, dass Menschen erwarten würden, dass ihre arbeitsbezogenen Daten auf diese Weise weitergegeben werden. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt „Daten, die wir in Verbindung mit unseren Anreicherungsprodukten sammeln und verarbeiten“.

. WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN INTERNATIONAL ÜBERMITTELN
4.1 Übermittlung ins Ausland innerhalb der HubSpot-Gruppe. Zur Erleichterung unserer globalen Geschäftstätigkeit können wir Informationen, die personenbezogene Daten enthalten können, an andere HubSpot Affiliate-Partner weitergeben, die als Unterauftragsverarbeiter fungieren, wo wir zu den in dieser Richtlinie beschriebenen Zwecken tätig sind. Eine Liste mit den verbundenen Unternehmen von HubSpot und ihren Standorten finden Sie in
Anlage 3 unserer Vereinbarung zur Datenverarbeitung für Kunden
.
Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt auch im Falle der Übertragung personenbezogener Daten in andere Länder. Wir haben angemessene Vorkehrungen getroffen, um zu gewährleisten, dass Ihre personenbezogenen Daten unabhängig vom Zielort der Übermittlung geschützt bleiben. Wenn wir personenbezogene Daten von Personen im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR“), in der Schweiz oder im Vereinigten Königreich („UK“) innerhalb der HubSpot-Partner und zwischen diesen weitergeben, stützen wir uns auf die Standardvertragsklauseln (die von der Europäischen Kommission und den Schweizer Behörden genehmigt wurden) und den britischen Zusatz zu den Standardvertragsklauseln (der von den britischen Behörden genehmigt wurde), sofern erforderlich.  Darüber hinaus verfügen wir gegebenenfalls über zusätzliche Schutzmaßnahmen (z. B. sichere Verschlüsselungsmethoden nach kommerziellem Industriestandard zum Schutz von Kundendaten im Ruhezustand und bei der Übertragung, TLS für von HubSpot gehostete Websites, Schutz durch Web Application Firewalls und andere geeignete vertragliche und organisatorische Maßnahmen), die im
HubSpot Trust Center
näher beschrieben werden.
4.2 Übermittlung an Dritte im Ausland. Manche unserer in vorliegender Datenschutzrichtlinie genannten, externen Dienstleister haben ihren Sitz in Ländern, deren Datenschutzgesetze eventuell nicht den Standards entsprechen, die in Ihrem Land gelten. Wenn wir personenbezogene Daten von Personen im EWR, in der Schweiz oder im Vereinigten Königreich an Dritte weitergeben, verwenden wir eine Reihe von rechtlichen Verfahren, um die Übermittlung zu schützen, darunter die von der Europäischen Kommission genehmigten Standardvertragsklauseln zum Datenschutz sowie gegebenenfalls zusätzliche Sicherheitsvorkehrungen. Für die Datenübermittlung aus dem Vereinigten Königreich oder in das Vereinigte Königreich beachten wir das Addendum für das Vereinigte Königreich. Für die Datenübermittlung aus oder nach Kanada halten wir die Standardvertragsklauseln ein. In Bezug auf personenbezogene Daten, die aus Kanada erhalten oder nach Kanada übertragen werden, untersteht HubSpot der Vollstreckungsgewalt des Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Bitte setzen Sie sich mit uns in Verbindung, wenn Sie weitere Informationen zu den gesetzlichen Regelungen benötigen, die wir befolgen, um personenbezogene Daten außerhalb des EWR, der Schweiz, Kanadas und des Vereinigten Königreichs zu übertragen.
4.3 Hinweis zum Datenschutzrahmen. HubSpot hält sich an den EU-U.S.-Datenschutzrahmen („EU-U.S. DPF“), die britische Erweiterung des EU-U.S. DPF und das „Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework“ („Swiss-U.S. DPF“), wie vom U.S. Department of Commerce festgelegt (zusammen „der Datenschutzrahmen“).
HubSpot hat gegenüber dem US-Handelsministerium bestätigt, dass es die EU-US-DPF-Grundsätze in Bezug auf die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten aus der Europäischen Union und dem Vereinigten Königreich (und Gibraltar) sowie die Swiss-US DPF-Grundsätze in Bezug auf die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten aus der Schweiz einhält. Im Falle eines Widerspruchs zwischen dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens sind die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens maßgeblich. Weitere Informationen zum Datenschutzrahmen und eine Ansicht der Zertifizierung von HubSpot finden Sie auf
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
Wenn Sie in der EU, dem Vereinigten Königreich oder der Schweiz ansässig sind, haben Sie das Recht, Zugang zu den personenbezogenen Daten zu erhalten, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben. Außerdem haben Sie das Recht, die Berichtigung, Ergänzung oder Löschung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen, wenn diese unzutreffend sind oder unter Verstoß gegen die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmen verarbeitet werden. Wir geben Ihnen die Möglichkeit, Ihre Zustimmung zu verweigern, wenn personenbezogene Daten, die wir über Sie kontrollieren, an einen unabhängigen Dritten weitergegeben oder für einen Zweck verwendet werden sollen, der sich wesentlich von den in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie dargelegten unterscheidet. Wenn Sie eines Ihrer Rechte ausüben möchten, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte über die unten angegebenen Kontaktmöglichkeiten.
In Übereinstimmung mit den Prinzipien des Datenschutz-Rahmens verpflichtet sich HubSpot, Beschwerden im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens über die Erhebung und Verwendung Ihrer persönlichen Daten zu klären. Personen aus der EU, dem Vereinigten Königreich und der Schweiz, die Anfragen oder Beschwerden bezüglich unseres Umgangs mit persönlichen Daten haben, die wir unter Berufung auf die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens erhalten haben, sollten sich zunächst über
privacy@hubspot.com
an HubSpot wenden. Wir werden alle Beschwerden im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens innerhalb von 45 Tagen untersuchen und versuchen, sie zu lösen.
In Übereinstimmung mit dem Datenschutzrahmen verpflichtet sich HubSpot, ungelöste Beschwerden über unseren Umgang mit personenbezogenen Daten, die wir unter Berufung auf den Datenschutz-Rahmen erhalten haben, an einen Anbieter für alternative Streitbeilegung mit Sitz in den Vereinigten Staaten weiterzuleiten. Wenn Sie von uns keine zeitnahe Eingangsbestätigung für Ihre Beschwerde im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens erhalten oder wenn wir Ihre Beschwerde im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens nicht zu Ihrer Zufriedenheit bearbeitet haben, besuchen Sie bitte
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
. Hier finden Sie weitere Informationen oder können eine Beschwerde einreichen. Die Dienstleistungen von TRUSTe Dispute Resolution sind für Sie kostenlos.
Unter bestimmten Umständen, die ausführlicher auf der Website für die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens beschrieben werden, haben Sie möglicherweise das Recht, ein rechtsverbindliches Schiedsgericht anzurufen, wenn andere Verfahren zur Beilegung von Streitigkeiten ausgeschöpft wurden. Die US-amerikanische Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ist für die Einhaltung der Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens durch HubSpot verantwortlich. HubSpot unterliegt den Ermittlungs- und Durchsetzungsbefugnissen der FTC.
Im Zusammenhang mit einer Weitergabe ist HubSpot für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verantwortlich, die das Unternehmen im Rahmen der Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens empfängt und anschließend an Dritte übermittelt, die als Bevollmächtigte für HubSpot handeln. HubSpot bleibt nach den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens haftbar, wenn die von uns bevollmächtigte Person Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in einer Weise verarbeitet, die nicht mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens vereinbar ist, sofern HubSpot nicht für das Ereignis, das den Schaden verursacht hat, verantwortlich ist.
Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir unter bestimmten Umständen verpflichtet sein können, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auf rechtmäßige Anfragen von Behörden hin offenzulegen, einschließlich der Erfüllung nationaler Sicherheits- oder Strafverfolgungsanforderungen.
5.  WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN SPEICHERN UND SCHÜTZEN
5.1 Datenspeicherung und -sicherheit. Wir verwenden diverse Sicherheitstechnologien und -verfahren, die zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten vor unbefugtem Zugriff, unbefugter Nutzung oder Preisgabe beitragen. Wir schützen die personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie auf Computerservern angeben, in einer kontrollierten, sicheren Umgebung. Dort sind diese vor unbefugtem Zugriff, unbefugter Nutzung und Preisgabe geschützt. Alle personenbezogenen Daten werden anhand angemessener physischer, technischer und organisatorischer Maßnahmen geschützt. Weitere Informationen zum Thema Sicherheit bei HubSpot finden Sie unter
https://trust.hubspot.com
.
5.2 Speicherung personenbezogener Daten. Wie lange wir die zu Ihnen erhobenen Daten speichern, hängt sowohl von der Art der Informationen ab als auch davon, wie wir sie erfassen und speichern. Nach einem angemessenen Zeitraum löschen oder anonymisieren wir die Daten. Sollte beides nicht möglich sein, werden die Daten von uns sicher gespeichert und so lange für jede weitere Nutzung gesperrt, bis ihre Löschung möglich ist.
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, so lange, wie unsererseits ein legitimes geschäftliches Interesse fortbesteht (etwa um unsere gesetzlichen Pflichten zu erfüllen, Streitigkeiten beizulegen und unsere vertraglichen Ansprüche durchzusetzen).
Wenn unsererseits kein legitimes geschäftliches Interesse an der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten fortbesteht, löschen oder anonymisieren wir diese Daten auf sichere Weise. Ist beides nicht möglich, speichern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten so lange auf sichere Weise und schließen sie von jeder weiteren Datenverarbeitung aus, bis die Löschung möglich ist. Wenn Sie uns dazu auffordern, löschen wir diese Daten zu einem früheren Datum. Nähere Informationen hierzu finden Sie im Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“.
Wenn Sie sich dafür entschlossen haben, Marketingmitteilungen von uns zu erhalten, speichern wir ab dem Datum, zu dem Sie Ihr Interesse an unseren Inhalten, Produkten oder Leistungen zum letzten Mal zum Ausdruck gebracht haben, für einen angemessenen Zeitraum Informationen zu Ihren Marketingpräferenzen. Besagter angemessener Zeitraum wird zum Beispiel ab dem Zeitpunkt bestimmt, zu dem Sie zuletzt eine unserer E-Mails geöffnet haben, oder ab dem Zeitpunkt, zu dem Sie die Nutzung Ihres HubSpot-Accounts eingestellt haben.  Wir speichern die über Cookies oder andere Tracking-Technologien erhobenen Daten für einen angemessenen Zeitraum ab der Erfassung der betreffenden Daten.
Die Daten, die wir im Namen von Kunden im Zusammenhang mit dem Abonnementdienst verarbeiten, werden gemäß den
HubSpot-Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
und der
Datenverarbeitungsvereinbarung
des Kunden gespeichert und geschützt.
6. COOKIES UND ÄHNLICHE TECHNOLOGIEN

7.2 Anti-Spam-Richtlinie. Unsere
Richtlinie zur akzeptablen Nutzung
gilt für uns und unsere Kunden. Sie verbietet unter anderem die Nutzung des Abonnementdienstes für den Versand unerwünschter gewerblicher E-Mails, soweit dies gegen geltendes Recht verstößt, und sie schreibt vor, dass alle über den Abonnementdienst versendeten E-Mails einen „Opt-out“-Mechanismus und weitere obligatorische Informationen enthalten müssen. Wir verlangen von allen unseren Kunden, dass sie sich uneingeschränkt zur Einhaltung der Richtlinie zur akzeptablen Nutzung verpflichten.

8. RECHT AUF PRIVATSPHÄRE NACH KALIFORNISCHEM RECHT
8.1 Anwendbarkeit. Dieser Abschnitt gilt nur für Verbraucher in Kalifornien. Im Rahmen dieses Abschnitts bezieht sich der Begriff „Persönliche Daten“ auf die ihm im California Consumer Privacy Act („CCPA“) zugeschriebene Bedeutung. In diesem Abschnitt wird beschrieben, wie wir in unserer Rolle als Unternehmen persönliche Daten von Verbrauchern in Kalifornien sammeln, nutzen und teilen und welche Rechte für Einwohner Kaliforniens gelten.
Falls Sie aufgrund einer Behinderung oder einer körperlichen oder geistigen Beeinträchtigung nicht in der Lage sind, auf diese Datenschutzrichtlinie zuzugreifen, können Sie uns kontaktieren und wir veranlassen, dass Sie die benötigten Informationen in einem alternativen, für Sie zugänglichen Format erhalten.
8.2 Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten sammeln, verwenden und weitergeben. Innerhalb der letzten zwölf (12) Monate haben wir die folgenden gesetzlichen Kategorien für persönliche Daten zusammengestellt:
(i) Kennungen wie Name, E-Mail-Adresse, Postanschrift und Telefonnummer. Wir erhalten diese Daten direkt von Ihnen oder über externe Quellen.
(ii) Geschäftsinformationen wie Einträge zu Abonnements. Wir erhalten diese Daten direkt von Ihnen.
(iii) Internet- oder Netzwerkinformationen wie den Browser- und Suchverlauf. Wir erhalten diese Daten direkt über Ihr Gerät.
(iv) Daten zur Geo-Positionierung wie die IP-Adresse. Wir erhalten diese Daten über Ihr Gerät.
(v) Finanzinformationen wie Zahlungsdaten oder Daten von Bankkonten, die im Laufe der Einrichtung Ihres Abonnements eingesetzt wurden. Wir erhalten diese Daten von Ihnen.
(vi) Berufliche Daten, wie Ihre Berufsbezeichnung und Ihr Unternehmen.
(vii) Andere persönliche Daten, z. B. wenn Sie mit uns online, per Telefon oder über E-Mail kommunizieren, um Hilfe durch unsere Helpdesks oder andere Supportkanäle zu erhalten; oder wenn Sie an Kundenumfragen oder Wettbewerben teilnehmen; oder bei der Einrichtung des Abonnementdienstes.
(viii) Folgerungen, die aus einer der oben genannten Kategorien gezogen werden, allein oder in Kombination.
In dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie wird beschrieben, für welche geschäftlichen und gewerblichen Zwecke wir diese Daten sammeln. Die Kategorien von Dritten, an die wir diese Informationen für einen geschäftlichen Zweck „weitergeben“, sind im Abschnitt „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten teilen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben. Der Zeitraum, für den wir diese Daten aufbewahren, wird im Abschnitt „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten speichern und schützen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben.
In den vorangegangenen 12 Monaten haben wir bestimmte Informationen, einschließlich Kennungen, an unsere Werbepartner „verkauft“ oder „weitergegeben“ (wie im CCPA definiert). Wir haben auch bestimmte Informationen, einschließlich Identifikatoren, ungefähre Standortdaten und berufliche Daten an unsere Kunden „verkauft“ oder „weitergegeben“.
8.3 Ihre Rechte als Einwohner Kaliforniens. Ihnen stehen bestimmte Rechte bezüglich der persönlichen Daten, die wir über Sie sammeln oder speichern, zu. Bitte beachten Sie, dass es sich hierbei um keine absoluten Rechte handelt, und es kann zu Fällen kommen, in denen wir Ihre Anfrage, soweit gesetzlich zulässig, ablehnen. Diese Rechte umfassen:
(i) Das Recht auf Auskunft bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, uns aufzufordern, Ihnen mitzuteilen, welche personenbezogenen Daten wir in den letzten 12 Monaten über Sie gesammelt und gespeichert haben.
(ii) Das Recht auf Löschung bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, uns dazu aufzufordern, von uns gesammelte und gespeicherte personenbezogene Daten über Sie zu löschen – von Ausnahmen abgesehen.
(iii) Das Recht auf Berichtigung bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, die Korrektur von fehlerhaften persönlichen Daten anzufordern, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben.
(iv) Das Recht, Informationen über die Kategorien personenbezogener Daten (falls vorhanden) anzufordern, die wir an Dritte oder Affiliate-Partner für deren Direktmarketingzwecke weitergeben.
(v) Das Recht, die Verwendung sensibler personenbezogener Daten einzuschränken, bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, Unternehmen anzuweisen, Ihre sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten nur für begrenzte Zwecke zu verwenden. Wir erfassen sensible personenbezogene Daten (wie z. B. Ihre Zahlungsinformationen), wie in den geltenden Gesetzen definiert, nur für die gesetzlich zulässigen Zwecke oder mit Ihrer Zustimmung. Wir sammeln und verarbeiten keine sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten, um Rückschlüsse auf Ihre Person zu ziehen.
(vi) Das Recht auf Widerspruch bedeutet, dass Sie gegen jede Entscheidung von uns, Ihre Datenschutzrechte nach geltendem Recht zu verweigern, Widerspruch einlegen können.
(vii) Das Recht darauf, nicht diskriminiert zu werden, bedeutet, dass Sie nicht diskriminierend behandelt werden, wenn Sie von einem Ihrer Datenschutzrechte Gebrauch machen.
Wir beantworten alle Einspruchsanfragen so schnell wie möglich, jedoch nicht später als gesetzlich vorgeschrieben.
8.4 So machen Sie als Einwohner Kaliforniens von Ihren Rechten Gebrauch. Sie können entweder selbst von diesen Rechten Gebrauch machen oder alternativ einen Handlungsbevollmächtigten bestimmen, der in Ihrem Namen von diesen Rechten Gebrauch macht. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir zum Schutz Ihrer persönlichen Daten Ihre Identität mit einer solchen Methode verifizieren, die der Art Ihrer Anfrage angemessen ist. Je nach Anfrage werden wir Sie um Daten wie Ihren Namen und Ihre E-Mail-Adresse bitten. Wir können Sie außerdem dazu auffordern, sicherzustellen, dass Ihr Handlungsbevollmächtigter von Ihnen eine schriftliche Genehmigung dafür erhält, in Ihrem Namen zu handeln. Zum Schutz Ihrer persönlichen Daten müssen wir möglicherweise darüber hinaus die Identität Ihres Handlungsbevollmächtigten verifizieren. Wir können den Antrag eines Vertreters ablehnen, der nicht nachweist, dass er berechtigt ist, in Ihrem Namen zu handeln.
Wir werden innerhalb des gesetzlich zulässigen Zeitrahmens antworten. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir für mehrere Anfragen innerhalb desselben 12-Monats-Zeitraums eine angemessene Gebühr erheben können, soweit dies gesetzlich zulässig ist.
Bitte wenden Sie sich unter den unten stehenden Kontaktdaten an uns oder konsultieren Sie Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“, wenn Sie:
(i) in einem alternativen Format auf diese Richtlinie zugreifen möchten;
(ii) eines Ihrer oben beschriebenen Rechte ausüben möchten;
(iii) mehr über Ihre Rechte oder unsere Datenschutzpraktiken erfahren möchten; oder
(iv) einen Handlungsbevollmächtigten bestimmten möchten, der in Ihrem Namen eine Anfrage stellt.
8.5 Recht auf Ablehnung des „Verkaufs“ oder der „Weitergabe“. HubSpot sammelt Daten aus öffentlich zugänglichen Quellen oder anderen Drittquellen und gibt diese Informationen an unsere Kunden weiter, die unsere Anreicherungsprodukte kaufen. Dies kann unter bestimmten staatlichen Datenschutzgesetzen wie dem CCPA als „Verkauf“ oder „Weitergabe“ angesehen werden. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt „Daten, die wir in Verbindung mit unseren Anreicherungsprodukten sammeln und verarbeiten“.
Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, wie im CCPA definiert, auch an dritte Werbepartner weitergeben, um im Namen von HubSpot personalisierte Werbung auf den Websites oder mobilen Apps anderer Unternehmen zu schalten. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt „Werbepartner“.
Wenn Sie möchten, dass Ihre Daten aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz entfernt werden, oder wenn Sie der Weitergabe Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten für unsere Werbe- und Marketingaktivitäten widersprechen möchten, füllen Sie bitte
dieses Formular
aus.
Sie können auch die personalisierte Werbung, die Sie sehen, kontrollieren, indem Sie diese Dienste nutzen:
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
oder
https://optout.aboutads.info
/ (oder wenn Sie sich in der Europäischen Union befinden, klicken Sie bitte hier:

Wir „verkaufen“ oder „teilen“ nicht wissentlich personenbezogene Daten von Kindern unter 16 Jahren.
9. SONSTIGE WICHTIGE INFORMATIONEN ZUM DATENSCHUTZ
9.1 Daten von Kindern. Die HubSpot-Websites, Produkte und Dienstleistungen sind nicht für Kinder unter 16 Jahren gedacht, und wir erfassen weder wissentlich noch absichtlich personenbezogene Daten über Kinder unter 16 Jahren. Wenn Sie mutmaßen, dass wir personenbezogene Daten eines Kindes unter 16 Jahren erfasst haben, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte
hier
, damit wir die Daten löschen können.
9.1.1 Daten von Kindern im Abonnementdienst. Unser Produkt oder der Abonnementdienst ermöglicht es unseren Kunden, Daten von Kinder zu erfassen, die in den Kundendaten enthalten sein können, gemäß unseren
Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
. Mehr Informationen darüber, wie wir als Auftragsverarbeiter Daten im Namen unserer Kunden verarbeiten, finden Sie im Unterabschnitt „Daten, die wir im Namen von Kunden verarbeiten, wenn diese den Abonnementdienst nutzen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie.
9.2 Externe Schlichtungsstelle. Wenn Sie ein ungelöstes Anliegen bezüglich des Datenschutzes oder der Verwendung Ihrer Daten haben, wenden Sie sich bitte (gebührenfrei) an unseren externen Schlichter in den USA unter
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
(auf Englisch).
10.  GOOGLE-PRODUKTE UND INTEGRATIONEN
10.1 Google reCAPTCHA. Zum Schutz vor Schadsoftware, die auf unseren Websites missbräuchliche Aktivitäten durchführen könnte, haben wir Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in einigen unserer Produkte und Services implementiert. Mehr über die Art der von Google erfassten Daten und deren Verwendungszwecke erfahren Sie in der
Datenschutzrichtlinie von Google
. Weitere Informationen zu den Produkten und Dienstleistungen von Google sind in den
Nutzungsbedingungen von Google
abrufbar.
10.2 Gmail-Integration. Wenn Sie die Gmail-Integration verwenden oder eine andere Google Workspace-Anwendung in HubSpot integrieren möchten, werden Sie aufgefordert, uns Zugriff auf Daten in Ihrem Gmail- oder Google-Konto zu gewähren.
Durch Ihre Verwendung der Gmail-Integration mit dem Abonnementdienst geben Sie dem Abonnementdienst Zugriff auf mit Ihrem Gmail-Konto verknüpfte Daten, darunter Kontakte, E-Mails, Kalender, Verteilerlisten, Betreffzeilen und URLs von Tracking-Links in Ihren E-Mails (sofern Sie die Funktion zum E-Mail-Tracking verwenden). Darüber hinaus kann der Abonnementdienst E-Mails aus Ihrem verknüpften Gmail-Konto lesen, bearbeiten, erstellen und versenden. Der Abonnementdienst überprüft den Inhalt Ihrer E-Mails, um zu ermitteln, für welche E-Mails Sie die Trackingfunktion aktiviert haben, und so die Benachrichtigungsfunktion für Sie bereitzustellen. Der Abonnementdienst speichert Antworten, ausgehende Nachrichten, E-Mail-Header, Betreffzeilen, Verteilerlisten, Aliasse, Versandzeiten und E-Mail-Texte. Ihr E-Mail-Verkehr kann unter Umständen sensible, private oder vertrauliche Informationen wie Kontaktnamen, private Nachrichten, Finanz- oder Gesundheitsdaten enthalten. Sie sind sich darüber im Klaren, dass die getrackten Korrespondenzen für andere Nutzer in Ihrem Abonnement-Team sichtbar sind. Google Workspace-APIs werden nicht verwendet, um verallgemeinerte KI- und/oder ML-Modelle zu entwickeln, zu verbessern oder zu trainieren.
Wenn Sie Ihr Gmail-Konto via IMAP (oder direkt über Google) mit dem Abonnementdienst verknüpfen, hat der Abonnementdienst ausschließlich Zugriff auf E-Mail-Adressen, Passwörter, Server-Informationen, E-Mail-Meta-Daten und E-Mail-Texte. Für die Verknüpfung Ihres Gmail-Kontos via IMAP müssen Sie keine anderen Google Workspace-Anwendungen mit HubSpot verknüpfen.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Mehr darüber, wie wir auf diese Daten zugreifen, erfahren Sie in folgendem Artikel der Wissensdatenbank:
Persönliche E-Mail-Konten mit HubSpot verknüpfen
.
10.3 Zusätzliche Einschränkungen der Nutzung Ihrer Google-Nutzerdaten. Die Nutzung von Informationen, die HubSpot von Google-APIs erhält, sowie deren Übertragung an eine andere App erfolgt gemäß der
Google API Services User Data Policy
, was die Anforderungen zur eingeschränkten Nutzung einschließt.
10.4 Google Kalender-Integration. Der Abonnementdienst hat Zugriff auf Ihren Google Kalender und auf jeden anderen Ihrer mit Google verknüpften Kalender, um Ihre Nutzung unseres Meetings-Tools zu unterstützen und um Ihnen zu ermöglichen, Events mit Kontakten in Ihrem HubSpot-Account zu verbinden. Der Abonnementdienst kann Ihre Kalender erstellen und ändern und einzelne Kalender-Events aktualisieren.
10.5 Google Drive-Integration. Durch die Verknüpfung mit Google Drive kann der Abonnementdienst Ihre Dateien aufrufen, hochladen und herunterladen sowie Dateiinhalte und -titel speichern. Der Abonnementdienst nutzt diese Berechtigungen, um Ihre Verwendung der Funktionen des Composer- und des Collect-Tools zu unterstützen, damit Sie Entwürfe für Blogartikel in Google Drive erstellen und anschließend für die Veröffentlichung hochladen können.
10.6 Google Search Console-Integration. Sie haben die Möglichkeit, Ihre Google Search Console mit unserem Content-Management-System (CMS) und Marketing Hub zu integrieren. Im Rahmen dieser Integration kann der Abonnementdienst Eigenschaften aufrufen, verwalten und speichern, welche die Liste der Websites und Domains, die Sie in HubSpot kontrollieren, und die Search Console-Daten für Ihre verbundenen Eigenschaften umfassen.
10.7 Chrome-Erweiterungen.
10.7.1 HubSpot-Browsererweiterung. Sie können die HubSpot-Browser-Erweiterung für Chrome installieren, um E-Mails aus Gmail und Google Workspace im Chrome-Browser nachzuverfolgen. Sobald die Erweiterung installiert ist, kann sie alle Ihre Daten auf den von Ihnen besuchten Websites lesen und ändern sowie Benachrichtigungen anzeigen. Die Erweiterung speichert alle E-Mails aus Gmail und kann in Verbindung mit der Inbox-Integration verwendet werden.
10.7.2 Collect-Erweiterung. Sie können die Collect-Erweiterung mit Ihrem Google Drive integrieren, um Dateien und Text direkt aus Ihrem Chrome-Browser in Google Drive hochzuladen. Diese Dateien stehen Ihnen anschließend über die Google Drive-Integration zur Verfügung.
10.7.3 Social-Media-Erweiterung. Sie können die Social-Media-Erweiterung für Chrome mit dem Social Composer Tool von HubSpot nutzen, um Seiten, Texte und Bilder aus dem Netz mit anderen Nutzern zu teilen. Sie können Beiträge verfassen und planen, Kampagnen zuweisen sowie Beiträge im Social-Media-Kalender oder – sobald sie veröffentlicht wurden – in Social-Media-Berichten ansehen.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Die Social-Media-Erweiterung greift erst auf Informationen über die aktuelle Seite zu, nachdem die entsprechende Schaltfläche auf der Symbolleiste angeklickt wurde. Dabei werden die in dem Wissensdatenbankartikel
Installieren und Nutzen der Social Chrome-Erweiterung von HubSpot
erteilten Genehmigungen beachtet.
10.8. YouTube-Integration. Wenn Sie HubSpot-Kunde sind und die YouTube-Integration mit Ihren Abonnementdiensten von HubSpot nutzen möchten, werden Sie aufgefordert, uns Zugriff auf die Daten Ihres YouTube-Kontos zu gewähren, und erhalten die Möglichkeit, Ihre Konten zu verknüpfen.
Durch Ihre Verwendung der YouTube-Integration mit dem Abonnementdienst erteilen Sie dem Abonnementdienst von HubSpot Zugriff auf mit Ihrem YouTube-Konto verknüpfte Daten. Der Abonnementdienst überprüft den Inhalt Ihres YouTube-Kontos, um zu ermitteln, für welche Inhalte Sie die Trackingfunktion aktiviert haben, und so Funktionen der Abonnementdienste für Sie bereitzustellen. Der Abonnementdienst speichert Informationen aus Ihrem YouTube-Konto. Sie nehmen zur Kenntnis, dass die Informationen aus Ihrem YouTube-Konto, die Sie in den Abonnementdiensten verfolgen, für andere Benutzer innerhalb Ihres HubSpot-Accounts sichtbar sein können.
Ihre Nutzung der YouTube-Integration von HubSpot unterliegt den Nutzungsbedingungen von YouTube unter
https://www.youtube.com/t/terms
und der Datenschutzrichtlinie von Google unter
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de
.
Zusätzlich zu den typischen Funktionen zur Datenlöschung, die in den Abonnementdiensten unterstützt werden, können Kunden die YouTube-Integration in Ihrem HubSpot-Account in den Google-Sicherheitseinstellungen unter
https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
widerrufen.
Tipp zu den HubSpot-Vertragsbedingungen: Weitere Informationen über unseren Zugriff auf Informationen und das Entfernen des Zugriffs auf Ihr Google-Konto finden Sie in folgendem Artikel der Wissensdatenbank:
Entfernen Sie den Zugriff auf HubSpot in Ihrem Google-Konto

EU & Swiss Privacy Policy
Effective date: November 15, 2023
Last modified date: November 7, 2023
Welcome to the Webflow, Inc., (hereinafter, “
Webflow
,” “
Company
,” “
us
,” “
our
,” or “
we
”) EU & Swiss Privacy Policy (the “
Policy
”).
This Policy governs how Webflow processes the Personal Information of individuals located in the United Kingdom ("
UK
"), European Union (“
EU
”), European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), and Switzerland (collectively, the “
Data Subjects
”) that are visiting our website, www.webflow.com, and the other websites under the webflow.com domain (collectively, the “
Sites
”), or are Customers who use our SaaS product, web design software, tools, and related services (together with the Sites, the “
Platform
”).
This Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Data Subjects’ information as part of the Service in accordance with data-protection laws in the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland (collectively the “
Data Protection Laws
”). Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Platform, whether or not you are a user of Webflow’s SaaS product.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Policy have the meaning given them in our
Terms of Service
or
Global Privacy Policy
including any relevant agreement, policy, or addendum incorporated therein and any amendments or modifications thereto.
By accessing and using our Platform, you signify your acceptance to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of this Policy, our Global Policy, or the
Terms of Service
, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our Platform. In the event of a conflict between the Global Privacy Policy and this Policy, this Policy supersedes the Global Privacy Policy.
HI THERE
‍
Welcome to Webflow’s EU & Swiss Privacy Policy! In these boxes, you’ll find our plain-English version of the policy. It isn’t legally binding, so please use this it only as an aid.
This version of our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the data of those in the United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland. It takes precedence over the Global Privacy Policy if there are any conflicts between the two.
As per usual with these sorts of things, your use of Webflow means you agree to these policies and terms. If you don’t agree, you shouldn’t use our service.
1. Our relationship to you
In order for you to understand Webflow’s data protection obligations and your rights to your Personal Information under this Policy, it is important that you identify which relationship(s) you have with Webflow.
A “User” is an individual providing Personal Information to us via our website or other services, products or platforms, such as by signing up for our newsletter or making an account and posting on the Forums. Webflow is in a “data controller” relationship with Users.
A “Customer” is a specific type of User that has engaged us to act as an agent (or, as a “Data Processor”) by obtaining services made available via through Platform. Webflow is in a “data processor” relationship with Customers.
Webflow does not have a direct relationship with Customers’ End Users. A “Customer End User” is an individual that provides their Personal Information to our Customers. We do not control the purposes nor the means by which this Personal Information is collected, and we are not in a direct relationship with Customer End Users. For details about how Personal Information about Customer End Users is handled, please review our Customers’ privacy policies instead of this one, and contact them for further information.
Hereinafter we may refer to Customers and Users collectively as “you.”
BASICALLY...
This is the bit where we define our relationship to you.
If you’ve given us some personal information, such as by subscribing to our newsletter or joining our forum, then you’re a “User” of Webflow and we’re a “Data Controller” of your account information, such as your name and email address.
If you use Webflow, then you’re a “Customer” and Webflow is a “Data Processor” for you.
A “Customer End User” is someone who provides their personal information to our Customers. We have no direct relationship with them.
Note that these categories are not mutually exclusive — you might be all three!
2. Notice
Webflow provides notice to you through posted privacy policies and may provide additional "just-in-time" disclosures about the data collection, use, and sharing practices of specific Platform. The
Global Privacy Policy
generally describes our privacy practices, while this Policy is specific to Users and Customers located in the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland.
As a data processor, Webflow is not able to provide notice to or obtain consent from Customer End Users. To the extent required by law, Webflow supports Customers’ data-protection compliance efforts, but it is up to the Customer to ensure the appropriate data protection safeguards are in place before processing Personal Information from Customer End Users.
BASICALLY...
We use our privacy policies and other “just-in-time” methods (like cookie notifications and popups) to let you know about how we gather, use, and share data.
Obviously, we can’t do that for the visitors of any websites you create and host on Webflow, so it’s up to you/your clients to make sure you’re informing your website visitors about how you’re handling their data.
3. Collection of Personal Information
As described in the
Global Privacy Policy
, Webflow collects various types of Personal Information about you while you are using the Platform. Information that is anonymized or aggregated is not “Personal Information.”
In general, we collect the following types of Personal Information:
Registration data:
full name, email address, and optional social media account information (e.g., if logging in through your Google account).
Profile data:
biographical information, avatar, portfolio of work, skills, and/or freelance availability.
Financial data:
bank account information, payment card information, transaction history, and/or company billing information.
Transaction data:
information about the transactions you make on our Platform, such as the names of your clients, the projects you complete, when projects are published, and/or timestamps of certain actions.
Online identifiers
: geolocation/tracking details, browser fingerprint, OS, browser name and version, and/or IP addresses.
Interaction data:
survey responses, forum or blog posts, authentication data, security questions, public social networking posts, user ID, click-stream data, and other data collected via cookies and similar technologies. Please read our
Cookie Policy
for more information.
Any information that is disclosed in the forums or our blog becomes public information. This means that your posts are available to the public and may appear in search engines or other publicly available platforms, and may be “crawled” or searched by third parties. Your public posts can also be read, collected, or used by others to send you unsolicited messages. Be careful when posting on public parts of our Platform and do not post any information that you are not comfortable sharing publicly.
BASICALLY...
We collect various kinds of personal information while you’re using Webflow, and all of that data is protected by the policies outlined here. Anonymized info is, naturally, not considered personal.
Any info you post or share on our blog or forum becomes public and crawlable by search engines and other bots, because that’s how the internet works.
4. Purposes of processing
Under Data Protection Laws, we are required to notify you about our purposes of processing your Personal Information, as well as the legal basis for such processing.
Unless otherwise permitted by law, we may process your Personal Information:
If you consent to the processing
To satisfy our legal obligations
If it is necessary to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we entered with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you

If we want to share your info with third parties not listed here or in our Global Privacy Policy, we’ll ask your permission when required by law. You may opt out of such sharing, but it’s possible that will limit your use of Webflow.
5. Third party sources of information
We only collect Personal Information about you from third parties that you voluntarily choose to connect with our Platform. For example, you can share Personal Information with us when you access our Site or Service through a third-party connection, or when you log in or connect an application to Webflow. We process this information for the purposes of performance of our contracts with you. For more information, please see Section 2 of the

We only collect your personal information from third parties that you choose to connect with Webflow, such as Google, if you choose to sign in with Google.
6. Third party recipients
Webflow conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide you with the Platform. However, we do engage third-party service providers (“subprocessors”) to assist with supporting our Platform, including vendors in the following areas:
Credit card or payment processors
Cloud storage providers
Customer support tools
Product development tools
IT and security service providers, and
Marketing or analytics tools
Each service provider is vetted and bound by contractual obligations that are equivalent to the provision of this Policy or more stringent. See the “Accountability for Onward Transfers” section below for more information about our agreements with third parties.
BASICALLY...
‍
We handle most of the data processing required for you to use Webflow ourselves, but we do use a few third-party services to handle things like payments, file storage, and analytics. All those services abide by policies like ours. More on that in the “Accountability for onward transfers” section below.
7. Retention
We are committed to keeping your Personal Information secure on our Platform. We limit our storage of your Personal Information to the amount of time necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected the Personal Information, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations, or to resolve disputes. Although retention laws and requirements vary by jurisdiction, we have some standard retention periods for parts of your Personal Information which are described below:
Contact information collected for marketing purposes, such as your name and email address, is retained on an ongoing basis until you unsubscribe from our marketing communications. Thereafter we will add your contact information to our suppression list indefinitely to respect your unsubscribe request.
Browser interaction data, such as cookies and trackers, is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie or date of collection.
Product analytics data is kept for up to 5 years, and automatically deleted on an ongoing basis.
If you have questions about retention periods that apply to any other data, please contact us at
privacy@webflow.com
.
BASICALLY...

We’re dedicated to keeping your personal info safe. That’s why we only store your data as long as it’s necessary to fulfill the purpose it was collected for. This varies by data type and jurisdiction, but two of the most important are:
Your marketing contact info

Your interaction data
: which we keep no longer than a year from the date of collection, or from the cookie’s expiration date
Product usage data:
which we keep for up to 5 years

16. Changes to this Policy
We reserve the right to modify, update, or change this Policy from time to time in the usual course of business, so we encourage you to review this page periodically. Notwithstanding, when we change this Policy in a material manner, we will update the effective date at the top of this page and provide you with reasonable advance notice before the updates to this Policy become effective. Webflow may provide such notifications to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, and/or through posting of such notice on the Platform. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you. You may be required to click-to-accept or otherwise agree to the updated Policy, but in any event your continued use or access of the Platform after the effective date of the updated Policy shall constitute your agreement to the updated Policy. The Policy will be effective as of the date specified in the effective date at the top of this page, and will apply to your use of the Platform from that point forward. If we update this Policy in a non-material manner after the effective date, we will update the last modified date at the top of this page. If you choose not to agree to this Policy or any future updated Policy, you may not use or access (and must discontinue any use or access to) the Platform. Webflow is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.
BASICALLY...
‍
We may change our privacy policy from time to time. If we make any major changes, we’ll let you know by email or by a prominent notice on our site(s). As mentioned above, your continued use of the Platform means you agree to be bound by this privacy policy, so be sure to check it occasionally.
If we realize we forgot a punctuation mark somewhere or we need to make an immaterial change to some wording, we will update the Last Modified Date, so you can see the last time we touched the terms in any way. E.g. we will update the Last Modified date but will spare your inbox if our lawyers decide that they now prefer the word "regardless" over "notwithstanding."

HubSpot is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to the personal data we collect and process in the course of our business. HubSpot acts in different ways when processing data:

We use this data for a variety of purposes, including to provide our products and services to you, contact you about relevant content, and improve and promote our products and services.
(ii) HubSpot acts as a processor when our customers use our products and services to collect and process personal data in connection with their sales, marketing, and other business activities. In this case, we act as a processor (or service provider) on behalf of our customers (who are controllers of personal data) under the HubSpot
Data Processing Agreement
included in the
Customer Terms of Service
.
(iii) HubSpot also acts as a controller when we collect and process personal data about individuals in their professional capacity, and make that information available to customers for their own sales, marketing, and other business activities. This includes personal data we may collect indirectly about you, such as from publicly available sources, our customers, or other third parties. For more information see the “What Information We Collect and Process” section.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy "Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. This Privacy Policy describes your choices and rights with respect to your Personal Data, including your rights of access and correction.
(i) For information about how to exercise your privacy rights when HubSpot acts as a controller of personal data, please see the “Your Privacy Rights and Choices” section.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform
Learn what’s viewable & searchable
We collect some data
about you

Affiliate services may have their own policies
Learn about affiliates
We use your data to make X better
Learn how we make your info work
You can control your experience
Learn how to update your settings

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:
IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identiﬁers; and identiﬁers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.
Advertisements.
When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether

5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF

1.1 Data You Provide To Us
You provide data to create an account with us.
Registration
To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.
You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).
Profile
You have
choices
about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo,
city or area
, endorsements, and optional
verifications
of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include
sensitive information
on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.
Posting and Uploading
We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services.
If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.
You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.

You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings.

When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.
Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “
LinkedIn Page
” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.

Affiliates
Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation.
2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.

settings
. We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles
here
and learn more about our approach to generative AI

Learn more
about the inferences we may make, including as to
your age and gender
and how we use them.
2.1 Services
Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
Stay Connected
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their
settings
, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can
choose
whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have
choices
about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.
Learn more
.
2.2 Premium Services
Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include
TeamLink
and
LinkedIn Pages
(e.g., content analytics and followers).
2.3 Communications
We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication
preferences
at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.

2.4 Advertising
We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
Learn more
about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g. like, comment, follow, share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others’ Services
You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention
We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data
You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.

If you choose to close your
LinkedIn
account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have
restricted
your account for breach of our
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache.
