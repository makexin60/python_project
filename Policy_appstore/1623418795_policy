Categories of personal information collected, used, sold, or shared
In  this  section  we  summarize  the  categories  of  personal  information  that  we've  collected,  used,  sold,  or
shared  and  the  purposes  thereof.
You  can  read  about  these  activities  in  detail  in  the  section  titled
“Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.
Information we collect: the categories of personal information we collect
We  have  collected  the  following  categories  of  personal  information  about  you:  identifiers,  commercial
information, internet or other electronic network activity information and geolocation data.
We do not collect sensitive personal information.
We will not collect additional categories of personal information without notifying you.
What are the purposes for which we use your personal information?
We  may  use  your  personal  information  to  allow  the  operational  functioning  of  this  Application  and
features  thereof  (“business  purposes”).  In  such  cases,  your  personal  information  will  be  processed  in  a
fashion necessary and proportionate to the business purpose for which it was collected, and strictly within
the limits of compatible operational purposes.
We  may  also  use  your  personal  information  for  other  reasons  such  as  for  commercial  purposes  (as
indicated  within  the  section  “Detailed  information  on  the  processing  of  Personal  Data”  within  this
document),  as  well  as  for  complying  with  the  law  and  defending  our  rights  before  the  competent
authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or we suffer an actual damage.
We  won’t  process  your  information  for  unexpected  purposes,  or  for  purposes  incompatible  with  the
purposes originally disclosed, without your consent.
How long do we keep your personal information?
Unless stated otherwise inside the “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” section, we
will not retain your personal information for longer than is reasonably necessary for the purpose(s) they
have been collected for.
How we collect information: what are the sources of the personal information we collect?
We collect the above-mentioned categories of personal information, either directly or indirectly, from you
when you use this Application.
For example, you directly provide your personal information when you submit requests via any forms on
this Application. You also provide personal information indirectly when you navigate this Application, as
personal information about you is automatically observed and collected.
Finally, we may collect your personal information from third parties that work with us in connection with
the Service or with the functioning of this Application and features thereof.
How  we  use  the  information  we  collect:  disclosing  of  your  personal  information  with  third  parties  for  a
business purpose
For  our  purposes,  the  word  “third  party”  means  a  person  who  is  not  any  of  the  following:  a  service
provider or a contractor, as defined by the CCPA.
We  disclose  your  personal  information  with  the  third  parties
listed  in  detail  in  the  section  titled
“Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.
These third parties
are grouped and categorized in accordance with the different purposes of processing.
Sale or sharing of your personal information
For  our  purposes,  the  word  “sale”  means  any  “selling,  renting,  releasing,  disclosing,  disseminating,
making  available,  transferring  or  otherwise  communicating  orally,  in  writing,  or  by  electronic  means,  a
consumer's  personal  information  by  the  business  to
a  third  party,  for  monetary  or  other  valuable
consideration
”, as defined by the CCPA.
This  means  that,  for  example,  a  sale  can  happen  whenever  an  application  runs  ads,  or  makes  statistical
analyses  on  the  traffic  or  views,  or  simply  because  it  uses  tools  such  as  social  network  plugins  and  the
like.
For  our  purposes,  the  word  “sharing”  means  any  “sharing,  renting,  releasing,  disclosing,  disseminating,
making  available,  transferring,  or  otherwise  communicating  orally,  in  writing,  or  by  electronic  or  other
means,  a  consumer's  personal  information  by  the  business  to  a  third  party  for  cross-context  behavioral
advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, including transactions between a
business and a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising for the benefit of a business in which
no money is exchanged”, as defined by the CCPA.
Please  note  that  the  exchange  of  personal  information  with  a  service  provider  pursuant  to  a  written
contract  that  meets  the  requirements  set  by  the  CCPA,  does  not  constitute  a  sale  or  sharing  of  your
personal information.
Your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information and how you can exercise it
We  sell  or  share  your  personal  information  with  the  third  parties
listed  in  detail  in  the  section  titled
“Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.
These third parties
are grouped and categorized in accordance with the different purposes of processing.
You  have  the  right  to  opt  out  of  the  sale  or  sharing  of  your  personal  information.  This  means  that
whenever  you  request  us  to  stop  selling  or  sharing  your  personal  information,  we  will  abide  by  your
request.
Such requests can be made freely, at any time, without submitting any verifiable request.
To fully exercise your right to opt out, you can contact us at any time using the contact details provided in
this document.
For a simplified opt-out method you can also use the privacy choices link provided on this Application.
If you want to submit requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information via a user-enabled
global privacy control, like the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”), you are free to do so and we will abide
by  such  request  in  a  frictionless  manner  (as  defined  in  the  CPRA  regulations).  The  GPC  consists  of  a
setting  or  extension  in  the  browser  or  mobile  device  and  acts  as  a  mechanism  that  websites  can  use  to
indicate  they  support  the  GPC  signal.  If  you  want  to  use  GPC,  you  can  download  and  enable  it  via  a
participating browser or browser extension. More information about downloading GPC is available here.
We  use  any  personal  information  collected  from  you  in  connection  with  the  submission  of  your  opt-out
request solely for the purposes of complying with the opt-out request.
Once  you  have  opted  out,  we  are  required  to  wait  at  least  12  months  before  asking  whether  you  have
changed your mind.
Your privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act and how to exercise them
The right to access personal information: the right to know and to portability
You have the right to request that we disclose to you:
●
the categories of personal information that we collect about you;
●
the sources from which the personal information is collected;
●
the purposes for which we use your information;
●
to whom we disclose such information;
●
the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
You  also  have
the  right  to  know  what  personal  information  is  sold  or  shared  and  to  whom.
In
particular, you have the right to request two separate lists from us where we disclose:
●
the categories of personal information that we sold or shared about you and the categories of
third parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared;
●
the categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose
and the categories of persons to whom it was disclosed for a business purpose.
The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past
12 months.
If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an
easily  usable  format  to  enable  you  to  transmit  the  information  to  another  entity  without  hindrance  —
provided that this is technically feasible.
The right to request the deletion of your personal information
You  have  the  right  to  request  that  we  delete  any  of  your  personal  information,  subject  to  exceptions  set
forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair
errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to
exercise certain rights etc.).
If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information
and notify any of our service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal
information  to  do  so  —  provided  that  this  is  technically  feasible  and  doesn’t  involve  disproportionate
effort.
The right to correct inaccurate personal information
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you,
taking  into  account  the  nature  of  the  personal  information  and  the  purposes  of  the  processing  of  the
personal information.
The  right  to  opt  out  of  sale  or  sharing  of  personal  information  and  to  limit  the  use  of  your  sensitive
personal information
You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. You also have the right
to request that we limit our use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information.
The right of no retaliation following opt-out or exercise of other rights (the right to non-discrimination)
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. This means that we will
not discriminate against you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a
different  price,  or  providing  a  different  level  or  quality  of  goods  or  services  just  because  you  exercised
your consumer privacy rights.
However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your
personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods
or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.
To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange
for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered
is reasonably related to the value of your personal information.
How to exercise your rights
To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us
via the details provided in this document.
For  us  to  respond  to  your  request,  it’s  necessary  that  we  know  who  you  are.  Therefore,  you  can  only
exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:
●
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about
whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
●
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate,
and respond to it.
We  will  not  respond  to  any  request  if  we  are  unable  to  verify  your  identity  and  therefore  confirm  the
personal information in our possession actually relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use any
personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the
purposes  of  verification  and  shall  not  further  disclose  the  personal  information,  retain  it  longer  than
necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.
If  you  cannot  personally  submit  a  verifiable  request,  you  can  authorize  a  person  registered  with  the
California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.
If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.
You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
How and when we are expected to handle your request
We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we
will process your request.
We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain
to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up
to 90 days to fulfill your request.
Our  disclosure(s)  will  cover  the  preceding  12-month  period.  Only  with  regard  to  personal  information
collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond
the  12-month  period,  and  we  will  provide  them  to  you  unless  doing  so  proves  impossible  or  would
involve a disproportionate effort.
Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly
unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In
either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
