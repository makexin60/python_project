DOT Privacy Policy
In its mission to ensure a safe, efficient, accessible and convenient transportation system that meets our vital national interests and enhances the quality of life, the Department of Transportation (DOT) collects, accesses and uses significant amounts of data every day.  The DOT is committed to protecting the safety of all data throughout the system development lifecycle, but is especially aware of the risks associated with the collection, use, storage, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII).  To help manage these risks, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has issued policy and supplemental guidance to ensure that the DOT fulfills its commitments to protect the personal privacy of all individuals.

Privacy Risk Management Policy
Document
DOT Order 1351.18 Privacy Risk Management Policy.pdf
This policy establishes the Department of Transportation (DOT) policy and assigns responsibilities for carrying out the privacy risk management requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act), the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the E-Government Act of 2002 (EGov), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, as well as general privacy risk management at DOT.
These requirements often overlap, and special attention must be paid to each before commencing any collection of information or engaging in activities that may create privacy risk(s) for individuals and the larger public. This policy establishes policies and responsibilities for managing privacy risk in creating, collecting, maintaining, using, storing, transmitting, protecting and destroying personally identifiable information (PII).
PII is personal or professional information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as the individual’s name, Social Security number (SSN), biometric records, etc., alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.
Further Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance states that “the definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires acase-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified by examining thecontext of use and combination of data elements. During the assessment it is important for agenciesto recognize that non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publiclyavailable. This applies to any medium and any source that, when combined with other availableinformation, could be used toidentify an individual.”
This policy also establishes policies and responsibilities for managing privacy risk in activities that do not include the collection of PII by DOT.
DOT is committed to ensuring that information is available in appropriate alternative formats to meet the requirements of persons who have a disability. If you require an alternative version of files provided on this page, please contact

Our Commitment
We respect your right to privacy and will protect it when you visit our Web site.
This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices only, including how we collect and use your personal information. It does not apply to third-party Web sites that you are able to reach from this Web site. However, the Department of Transportation does evaluate the privacy policies of its unofficial presences on third-party Web sites and third-party content rendering applications. We encourage you to read those privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information. You may also read our Privacy Impact Assessments for these third-party Web site and content rendering applications.
What We Automatically Collect Online
We collect information about your visit that does not identify you personally. We can tell the computer, browser, and Web service you are using. We also know the date, time, and pages you visit. Collecting this information helps us design the site to suit your needs. In the event of a known security or virus threat, we may collect information on the Web content you view.

Our principal purpose for collecting personal information online is to provide you with what you need and want, address security and virus concerns, and to ease the use of our Web site.
We will only use your information for the purposes you intended, to address security or virus threats, or for the purposes required under the law. See “Choices on How We Use the Information You Provide” to learn more.
We collect information to:
Respond to your complaints
Reply to your “feedback comments”

Sharing Your Information
We may share personally identifiable information you provide to us online with representatives within the Department of Transportation’s

and related entities, other Federal government agencies, or other named representatives as needed to speed your request or transaction. In a government-wide effort to combat security and virus threats, we may share some information we collect automatically, such as IP address, with other Federal government agencies.
Also, the law may require us to share collected information with authorized law enforcement, homeland security, and national security activities. See the Privacy Act of 1974 below.
Choices on How We Use the Information You Provide
Throughout our Web site, we will let you know whether the information we ask you to provide is voluntary or required. By providing personally identifiable information, you grant us consent to use this information, but only for the primary reason you are giving it. We will ask you to grant us consent before using your voluntarily provided information for any secondary purposes, other than those required under the law.
Information Practices for Children
We do not intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13. If in the future we choose to collect personal information from children, we will comply with the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

Securing Your Information
Properly securing the information we collect online is a primary commitment. To help us do this, we take the following steps:
Employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties
Train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures
Secure the areas where we hold hard copies of information we collect online
Perform regular backups of the information we collect online to insure against loss
Use technical controls to secure the information we collect online including but not limited to:
Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
Encryption
Firewalls
User ID and Password protections
We periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance
We employ external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized tries of outsiders to hack into, or cause harm to, the information in our systems
Tampering with DOT’s Web site is against the law. Depending on the offense, it is punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
Your Rights Under the Privacy Act of 1974
The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the Federal government keeps on you in systems of records (SOR) (information the DOT controls recovered by name or other personal identifier). The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and keep the personal information that it collects. The Privacy Act does not cover all information collected online.
The Act’s major terms require agencies to:
Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR
Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you
Allow you to, on request, access and review your information held in an SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it.
When the DOT collects information from you online that is subject to the Privacy Act (information kept in an SOR), we will provide a Privacy Act Statement specific to that collected information. This Privacy Act Statement tells you:
The authority for and the purpose and use of the information collected subject to the Privacy Act
Whether providing the information is voluntary or mandatory
The effects on you if you do not provide any or all requested information
