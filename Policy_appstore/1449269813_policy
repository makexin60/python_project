Privacy and Cookie Notice for Players
We are Lucky Kat BV. We are based at Binckhorstlaan 36 M214, 2516 BE Den Haag, The Netherlands.
We are based in The Netherlands and you can reach us at

if you have questions about data protection, or if you have any requests for resolving issues with your personal data. You can also write to the above address.
In this privacy notice we describe:
* The ways we collect personal data about you when you play one of our games and why we do so
* How we use your personal data, and
* The choices you have about your personal data.
Our games are ad-supported, and when you play our games we process personal data to be able to show you ads. We are committed to a lawful, fair and transparent processing of personal data.
1.          We process the following (categories of) personal data
When you play our games we process the following personal data:
·       Your IP address, and the country based on the IP address.
·       Your device type (for example, iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21) and operating system version.
·       Your Game Center ID (for iOS games) or Google Play ID (for Android games) and the nickname.
·       For analytics, when you installed and played the game, your progress throughout the game, and events that are connected to your game-play. We generally cannot identify you with this data, but treat it the same as personal data or personally identifiable data.
·       For advertising, our third-party ad partners receive from us your IP address and advertising identifier (IDFA for iOS devices and GAID for Android devices). What information we collect and share depends on the permissions you grant in the game.

2.          What (purposes) do we use the data for
We use this personal data to perform analytics for our games and allow third-parties to sell, buy and deliver advertising in those games that display advertising.
3.          What is our legal basis for the processing
For both analytics and advertising we base the processing of personal data on the legitimate interest
[OO2]
of Lucky Kat Studios and that of our partner.
- For analytics, this is our ability to analyze how players progress through our games to make them better, and to know our player-base on an aggregate level.
- For advertising, this is our ability to be able to off-set development costs and risk with advertising income.
For the third-parties we use, their legitimate interest is to be able to offer us their services, and for advertising third-parties and advertisers to be able to show you advertising.
Some third-parties choose to rely on consent, in which case they will ask for your consent before processing your personal data.

When a third-party service provider is a controller, they may keep data as well, either for a shorter or longer period.
6.          What safeguards have we taken to protect data
Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, we have taken the following technical and organizational measures:
