PLEASE READ THE PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY
Last modified: 22nd February 2024
At RYPT are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our Website (www.rypt.app) and our Subscription Plan, including our associated mobile applications (“Apps”) owned and controlled by RYPT. This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this privacy policy, you should not use the Site or sign-up for a Subscription Plan.
Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.
We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review and periodically make updates. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice by sending you an email notification.
While we will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy prior to the changes becoming effective, we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.

How to Access & Control Your Personal Data
1. Information about us
Flamenco IL Holdings Limited is the controller and responsible for your personal data (collectively referred to as “RYPT”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this privacy policy). We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the DPO using the details set out below.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our treatment of the information you provide us, please write to us by email at hello@rypt.app or by mail to Flamenco IL Holdings Limited6, The Crescent, Galway, Ireland, H91 NHP3, Attn: Privacy.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Data Protection Commissioner’s Office (DPC), the Irish supervisory authority for data protection issues (
https://www.dataprotection.ie/
). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the DPC, so please contact us in the first instance.
2. Use of the Subscription Plan
Our Subscription Plan allows any company or individual that uses it to create trainer and business profiles, exercises, workouts, workout programs, and other content, “Customer Data” as described in our
Customer Terms of Use
. The Subscription Plan can also be used to store, process and analyze the data of their users, “End User Data” as described in our
End User Terms of Use
. The information added to the Subscription Plan, either by customers or end users is stored and managed on our service provider’s servers. This information is then used to deliver athletic development coaching services to them, improve performance, and reduce injury risk.
RYPT does not control the content our customers produce, or the information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Subscription Plan. The information is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. RYPT processes our customers’ information as they direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers, and we store it on our service provider’s servers, but we do not have control over its collection or management. Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Subscription Plan, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as required by law. We have no direct relationship with the end users who provide Personal Information to our customers.
RYPT acknowledges that you have the right to access your Personal Information, as described below. You as the end user control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Subscription Plan. If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable time frame. We may work with our customers to help them provide notice to their visitors about their data collection, processing and usage. We are not responsible for our customers’ use of the information they collect through the Subscription Plan.
RYPT collects information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Information it processes. If you are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers who uses our Subscription Plan, please contact the customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer Personal Information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

c. Legal basis for processing Personal Information (EEA visitors only)
If you are a visitor/customer located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Flamenco IL Holdings Limited is the data controller of your personal information. RYPT’s Data Protection Officer can be contacted at hello@rypt.app.
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

We use Navigational Information to operate and improve the Site and the Subscription Plan. We may also use Navigational Information alone or in combination with Personal Information to provide you with personalized information about RYPT.

This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of processing on our behalf.
g. Security of your Personal Information
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. All Personal Information is protected using appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures.
h. Social Media Features
Our Site may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share This button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features.  Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.

j. Public Forums
We may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the Site if you so request, as described in “Opting Out and Unsubscribing” below.
k. Retention of Personal Information
How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information as described in further detail below.  After such time, we will either delete or anonymise your information or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
We retain Personal Information that you provide to us where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, as long as is required to contact you about the Subscription Plan, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we securely delete the information or anonymise it or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in “To Unsubscribe from Our Communications” below.
If you share End User Data, as described in our
End User Terms of Use
, with our customers as part of their use of the Subscription Plan, our customers will have access to that data as long as long as you are linked to their account. You have control over your End User Data at all times and you can remove yourself from the customer’s account at any time via the mobile application if you want to remove access to your data.
If a customer terminates its use of the Subscription Plan, then we will provide the customer with access to all their Customer Data, described in our
Customer Terms of Use
, created during their use of the Subscription Plan, but they will no longer have access to End User Data. After termination of the Subscription Plan, we will retain the Customer Data for a reasonable amount of time after which we may, unless legally prohibited, delete all Customer Data from the Subscription Plan. If an End User account is not linked to any active subscription plan, we will retain the End User Data for a reasonable amount of time after which we may, unless legally prohibited, delete all End User Data.
If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our content, or products, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your RYPT account.  We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.
5. How we Share Information we Collect
a. Service Providers
We may employ other companies and people to provide services to visitors to our Site and our Subscription Plan customers and may need to share your information with them to provide information, products or services to you. In all cases where we share your information with such agents, we explicitly require the agent to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and customer data handling policies.
b. Partners
In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, or provide customer support. Such third parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. We may partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner’s privacy policy so you can learn more about how to opt-out of the partner’s communications. These co-marketing partners are required to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies.
c. Corporate Events
If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by RYPT on the Website and the Subscription Plan. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Information, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.
d. Compelled Disclosure
We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process.
6. International Transfer of Information
Third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are all based inside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will not involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
If we were to choose a third-party processor in future, we would only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see
European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries
.
Were we to use providers based in the US, we would only transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see
European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield
.
Please contact us
here
if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
