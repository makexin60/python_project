Welcome
Hi! My name is Will
I have been building iOS apps now for over 10 years. The main reason I say that is so it's obvious that I'm not a web developer. The fact that this site even exists is a small miracle.
This site is mainly devoted to my personal hobby projects, like
Linked List
. It is a tool borne out of my own need for a more centralized method of testing universal links and AASA files across multiple domains. If you'd like to try it out before downloading, check out the
app clip
