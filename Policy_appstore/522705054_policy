This website uses the Insight tag from LinkedIn. This service is provided by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.
Data processing by LinkedIn Insight tag
We use the LinkedIn Insight tag to obtain information about visitors to our website. Once a website visitor is registered with LinkedIn, we can analyze the key occupational data (e.g., career level, company size, country, location, industry, job title) of our website visitors to help us better target our site to the relevant audience. We can also use LinkedIn Insight tags to measure whether visitors to our websites make a purchase or perform other actions (conversion measurement). Conversion measurement can also be carried out across devices (e.g. from PC to tablet). LinkedIn Insight Tag also features a retargeting function that allows us to display targeted advertising to visitors to our website outside of the website. According to LinkedIn, no identification of the advertising addressee takes place.
LinkedIn itself also collects log files (URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser characteristics and time of access). The IP addresses are shortened or (if they are used to reach LinkedIn members across devices) hashed (pseudonymized). The direct identifiers of LinkedIn members are deleted by LinkedIn after seven days. The remaining pseudonymized data will then be deleted within 180 days.
The data collected by LinkedIn cannot be assigned by us as a website operator to specific individuals. LinkedIn will store the personal data collected from website visitors on its servers in the USA and use it for its own promotional activities. For details, please see LinkedIn’s privacy policy at

This statement of data privacy applies only to our websites and their subpages. Our websites can also contain links to other providers not covered by this statement. If you leave our websites via a link, it is recommended to carefully read the data protection regulations of each website that collects personal data.
1. Social Media Buttons
We have integrated buttons with graphics of Facebook, Linkedin and Youtube on our homepage so that you can find CADENAS on those social media platforms with one click. In the interest of the most extensive protection of your data, the buttons are only integrated as a link to the respective services. This assures that data transfer to any operator of the social network will not take place without previous activation on your part. After clicking the button, you will be forwarded to the provider and can then visit the pages of CADENAS on each of the platforms, find out about activities and topics around CADENAS, leave your comments and exchange ideas with others. Third-party pages are operated exclusively by the same. We neither have any influence on the data collected there and the data processing nor do we have any knowledge about the full extent of data collection, the purpose thereof as well as the storage periods. Information on the handling of your personal data when using those websites is available in the data protection regulations of the provider.
2. YouTube
We have integrated YouTube videos into our websites, stored at http://www.YouTube.com and playable directly from our websites. These are all integrated in “extended data protection mode”, i.e. no data about you as a user will be transferred to YouTube when you are not playing any videos. Only when viewing videos YouTube, if need be, will store cookies on your computer and so-called  server log files, see 1, will be transferred. YouTube uses this data to collect information about the visitors of their website, i.a. for statistics, preventing fraud and improving usability. Also a connection with the Google DoubleClick network is established. Moreover, if you are logged into your YouTube account, YouTube can assign your surfing behavior directly to your personal profile. If this is against your wishes, we recommend that you log out of your YouTube account before playing the video. We have no influence on the said data transfer and collect no personal data with regard to the embedding of YouTube videos. Information about the handling of your personal data when using those websites is available in YouTube’s data protection policy:
https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines
The embedded YouTube videos are used in the framework of permitted use by YouTube, which all YouTube users must accept:
https://www.youtube.com/t/terms
.
In case you notice any copyright violation, please report this directly to YouTube.
3.  Use of Google Site Search
Google custom search engine „Google CSE“ Is the central search service on the CADENAS homepage. The integrated search service allows a full-text search for contents of the official Internet offer from CADENAS. For user information on the Internet offer, “search Google™ cadenas.de” is displayed in the search box. When the user enters a term in the search box, an additional link appears below the search box that refers to data protection when using the Google™ search.
After entering the search term in the search box, pressing enter or the search icon (magnifying glass), the user activates the search function and the search results page appears, which loads the Google search results by means of a plugin provided by Google.
The plugin, developed and provided by Google (Google Custom Search Engine, “Google CSE”), is integrated into the search results page by CADENAS as a software module “as is”(unchanged). The plugin enables automatic communication (data exchange) between the search results page and Google service, when the results page is called up. The use of Google’s search function includes a dynamic transfer of data to the search results page by the service provider Google.
In principle, no data is transferred to the provider of the search service (Google) when CADENAS websites are officially called up, where the "Google user-defined search" is integrated. Data is first transferred to Google after the user has activated the search box, a full-text search has started and the search results page is called up. When using the search function within the results page, user data is also sent to the Google server in the USA and stored there.
By using the full-text search and the accompanying search results page, you consent to the use of the Google search service as well as to the transfer of data to the Google service. This includes e.g. search terms you have entered and the IP address of the computer you are using. Please note that other standards of data protection apply for Google than for the Internet offer from CADENAS. We draw your attention to the fact that processing, in particular the storing, deleting and use of personal data possibly transmitted, is the matter of the provider of the search service and that CADENAS has no influence on the type and extent of the data transferred and further processed.
In its privacy policy Google commits itself not to pass on information to third parties,however, it makes exceptions from that. This means information could be transferred to third parties, if this is legally required in the US or if third parties process data for Google. If you are logged in to Google, the Google service is in the position to assign the information directly to your user profile. You should log out to prevent profile information about you from being collected.
Further information from Google Inc. about the handling of user data (data privacy policy) can be obtained here:
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
4. Use of Google Maps
On our websites and apps you can use the Google Maps service to see where CADENAS branch offices or a manufacturer is located on an interactive map. In doing so information about using CADENAS wesbites or apps, including your IP address is transferred to the Google server in the US and stored there.
In its privacy policy Google commits itself not to pass on information to third parties ,however, it makes exceptions from that. This means information could be transferred to third parties, if this is legally required in the US or if third parties process data for Google. You can find Google’s privacy policy here:
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
You have the option to switch off the card service and to prevent data transfer to Google. Simply deactivate JavaScript in your browser. In this case, you will no longer be able to use the location display.
5. Share Function
We offer you the so-called “share function” on our websites. This can be used to share the contents of our websites, such as news or CAD models, with persons who you think would be interested, per e-mail and via Social Media Buttons (Facebook, Tumblr, Xing, Google Plus, Pinterest, WhatsApp,LinkedIn, Twitter).
In case you share contents via email, please be aware of the fact that you are responsible for the sent email and deemed to be Data Controller pursuant to the German Federal Data Protection Act. In the interest of the fullest protection possible for your data, the Buttons on our websites and in our apps are integrated only as a link to the respective services. This ensures that a data transfer does not take place to the operator of each social network without prior activation performed by you. After clicking onto the button without being logged into the social network, the login window of the selected social network will open in a new browser window and at the same time a cookie will be placed on your hard disk. If you click the button while being already logged into the social network, the network will be able to allocate your visit to your account on the social network. Websites of third parties are solely operated by them. We neither have any influence on the data collected and processed, nor do we know anything about the full extent of the data collection, the purposes as well as the storage limits. Information about the handling of your personal data when using those websites is available in the provider’s data protection policy.

1.	In general
We publically maintain accessible profiles in social networks. The social networks we use are detailed below. Social networks such as Facebook, Google+, etc. can, as a rule, analyse your user behavior comprehensively when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media contents (e.g. like- buttons or banners). When you visit our social media presence, numerous data protection processes are triggered. Specifically: When you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign the visit to your user account. Your personal data might also be collected even if you are not logged in or you do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, data collection can take place via the cookies stored on your end device or by the collecting of your IP address. With the help of such data, the operators of social media portals can create user profiles that contain your preferences and interests. This way, interest-related advertising can be displayed for you in and outside of the respective social media presence. If you have an account with a certain social network, interest-related advertising can be displayed on all devices where you are or were logged in. Moreover, please note that we cannot trace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider,  additional processing can be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. For details, see the terms of use and data protection regulations of the respective social media portal.
2. Legal basis
Our social media presence should be as comprehensive on the Internet as possible. This is a legitimate interest as set out in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The analyzing processes initiated by the social networks are possibly based on differing legal grounds, which must be stated by the operators of the social networks (e.g. Consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.
3.	Person responsible and the exercise of rights

You have the right not to be subject to a decison solely based on automated processing - profiling included – which has indirect legal effects for you or otherwise affect you adversely. This does not apply, if the decision
is necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract between you and the responsible party,
is permissible as per legal regulations of the European Union or member states, which the responsible party is subject to, and those legal regulationss contain appropriate measure to ensure you rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests or
is made with your expressed consent.
However, those decisions must not be based on special categories of personal data in accordance with Art. 9(1) GDPR, as far as Art. 9(2)(a) or (g) GDPR does not apply and suitable measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well as their legitimate interests.
In regards to (1) and (3) of the mentioned cases, the responsible party is to take suitable measures to ensure the rights and freedoms as well as their legitimate interests, which is to include at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person on the part of the responsible party, to present one's own point of view and to challenge the decision.
10. Right of appeal with a supervisory authority
Irrespective of another administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right of appeal with a supervisory authority, in particular with the member state of your residence, your workplace or the place of the presumed infringement, if you are of the opinion that the processing of your personal data is in violation of the GDPR.
The supervisory authority, where you made your appeal, shall inform the complainant of the status and results of the appeal, including the possibility of a judicial remedy as per Art. 78 GDPR.
The competent supervisory authority for CADENAS Konstruktions-, Softwareentwicklungs- und Vertriebs GmbH is the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision.
Which sources and data do we use?
We process personal data we receive in the course of our business relationship with our members or others concerned. In addition, we process – as far as necessary to render our services – personal data that we permissibly obtain from publicly accessible sources (e.g. press, Internet) or other third parties (e.g. manufacturers of product catalogs CAD models) from which we are entitled.
Relevant personal data consists of personal details (last name, first name, company address, company e-mail address and other contact details) and other data voluntarily provided by our members (e.g. profile photo). Moreover, the data can also come through the fulfillment of our contractual obligations (e.g. by download or e-mail related CAD model, number and time of the download and/or  e-mail), advertising and sales data (incl. advertising scores) as well as other data comparable with the above-mentioned categories.
For what reason do we process your personal data (purpose of processing) and on which legal basis?
We process personal data in accordance with the provisions of the basic EU data protection regulation (GDPR) and the Federal Data Protection Law (BDSG)
a. to meet contractual obligations (Art. 6(1)(b)  GDPR)
Data processing is done for the rendering of host services in the course of performing our contracts with our members or to take pre-contract measures as a result of requests. The purposes of data processing are oriented in the first place towards concrete database research and the resulting requesting and collecting of data (e.g. CAD models) and can include, among other things, the transferring of your data to the respective manufacturer of requested product catalogs due to our license agreements. For further details about data processing purposes, see the relevant contract documents as well as the terms and conditions of use.
b. in the course of balancing the interests of parties (Art. 6(1)(f)  GDPR)
We will process your data as needed beyond the fulfillment of the contract to safeguard our legitimate interests or those of third parties. Examples:
Testing and optimizing of methods for a requirement analysis in order to address members directly.
to satisfy legal claims and for defense in legal disputes,
to safeguard IT security and the company's  IT operations,
prevention and investigation of criminal offences
Measures for business management and the further development of services and products,
Risk management in the company.
c.subject to your consent (Art. 6(1)(a)  GDPR)
Insofar as you have consented to the processing of your personal data for certain purposes (e.g. the volunteering of your profile picture, newsletter, advertising or market and opinion research), the legality of that processing is given on the basis of your consent.  Your given consent can be withdrawn at anytime. This also applies to the withdrawal of consents which were given to us before the application of the GDPR, that is before 15th May 2018. The withdrawal of a consent applies to the future and has no affect on the legality of data processed up to the withdrawal.
Who gets my data?
The areas within the company which have access to your data if needed to meet our contractual and legal obligations. Services providers and agents we use for order processing can receive the data for that purpose, sofar as they observe data secrecy. Those are companies in the categories of IT services, logistics, print services, telecommunication, collection, consultation as well as sales and marketing.
Other data recipients can be those places for which you gave us your consent to transfer data or for those due to our contractual relationship with you and a third party who are authorized to transfer personal data within a balancing of interests. We are authorized to do so in meeting our contractual obligations (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and, if necessary, in the course of a balancing of interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) to transfer your personal data (e.g. e-mail address and the information of the CAD model you obtained) to the respective manufacturer of the requested product catalog so that he can run an invoice control of the delivery order and also contact you to inform you of faulty and/or updated CAD models.
Moreover, we provide for each manufacturer of the product catalog requested statistics of usage behavior (e.g. number of downloads, sector, location). The manufacturer can process your data for advertising, marketing or opinion research as an independent person responsible i.S.d. DSGVO within his justified interests according to Art. 1 f DSGVO, provided you have not objected to the use of your data for these purposes. An objection in this case is to be made directly to the manufacturer
Will data be transferred to a third country or an international organisation?
A data transfer to countries outside of the European Union (so-called third countries) will take place if
it is necessary for the providing of CAD models from our database which have been ordered,
it is prescribed by law (e.g. fiscal reporting obligations) or
you have given us your consent.
In addition, a transfer to places in third countries is foreseen in the following cases:
If necessary in individual cases, your personal data might be transferred to an IT provider in the USA or another third country to ensure the company's IT operations in compliance with the European level of data protection.
CADENAS subsidiaries in third countries will receive your personal data only if they have obligated themselves to maintain a suitable level of data protection in EU standard contractual clauses.
How long will my data be stored?
We will process and store your personal data as long as needed to meet our contractual and legal obligations.
If the data is no longer needed to meet contractual or legal obligations, the data will be deleted at regular intervals, unless further processing, for a limited time, is necessary for the following purposes:
Fulfillment of commercial and fiscal retention obligations resulting, for example, from: commercial code (HGB), tax code (AO). The specified deadlines for retention and documentation are usually six to ten years.
Keeping of evidence according to the statute of limitations. As per §§ 195 of the Civil Code (BGB), statutes of limitation can be up to 30 years, although the regular statute of limitations is 3 years
Which data protection rights do I have?
Each person concerned has the right to information as per Article 15 GDPR, the right to correction as per Article 16 GDPR, the right to cancellation as per Article 17 GDPR, the right to limitation of processing as per Article 18 GDPR, the right to contradiction as per Article 21 GDPR as well as the right to data portability as per Article 20 GDPR. For the right to information and cancellation, the limitations as per §§ 34 and 35 BDSG apply. Moreover, there is a right of appeal to a responsible data protection supervisory authority (Article 77 GDPR in conjunction with § 19 BDSG).
Consent given for the processing of personal data can be revoked at anytime. This also applies to the withdrawal of consents which were given to us before the application of the GDPR, that is before 25th May 2018. Please note that the revocation becomes effective only for the future. Processings that took place before the revocation are not affected.
Detailed information about your data protection rights can be obtained from our general data protection declaration starting at chapter XIV.
Is there an obligation for me to provide data?
Within the scope of our business relationship, you must provide personal data needed for the start, performing and end of a business relationship and to meet contractual obligations necessary thereby or if we are legally required to collect the data. Without the data, we will normally not be able to conclude, perform and end a contract with you. You conclude a use / license agreement when requesting CAD models on our portal.
To what extent is there automated decision making?
When entering and implementing a  business relationship, in principle no fully-automated decision making is used as per Article 22 GDPR. Should we use such methods in individual cases, we will inform you of the same and separately about your rights, provided this is legally mandated.
Does profiling take place?
We process your data in part automatically with the aim to evaluate certain personal aspects (profiling). We use profiling in the following cases:
We use evaluation tools to be able to inform and give advice about products. They enable needs-based communication and advertising, including marketing and opinion research.
Information about your right of objection according to Article 21 GDPR
Case-by-case right of objection
You have the right, for reasons pertaining to your particular situation, to object at anytime to the processing of your personal data, which takes place based on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (data processing in public interest) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (data processing for the balancing of interests); this also applies to supported profiling according to Article 4 No. 4 GDPR.
If you file an objection, we will no longer process your  personal data unless we can prove compelling legitimate reasons for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedom, or the processing serves the establishment,  exercise or defense of legal claims.
Right to object to the processing of data for the purpose of direct advertising
In individual cases, we will process your personal data to do direct advertising. You have the right to object at anytime to the processing of your personal data for such advertising; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to direct advertising.
If you object to the processing for purposes of direct advertising, we will no longer process your personal data for such purposes.
