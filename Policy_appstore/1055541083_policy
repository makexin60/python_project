This extensive research culminated in a compelling demonstration at the New York Toy Fair 2023, garnering enthusiastic feedback for its precision, even in noisy environments. The GPCM300A's single-chip design, now augmented with TrulyHandsfree technology, sets a new standard for cost-effective, powerful voice applications.
Generalplus Technology, headquartered in Taiwan, is a global force in the integrated circuits domain, specializing in voice-controlled products for education, toys, and home appliances. Millions of their products are in use worldwide. Jacky Chen, Generalplus Marketing Manager, highlighted the impact of the Sensory and Generalplus collaboration, "The integration of Sensory's THF technology with our GPCM300A chip, showcased at the New York Toy Fair, was so impressive that our customers immediately sought to incorporate this technology into their 2024 product lines."
Developers can now leverage Sensory's advanced speech models for both children and adults through the VoiceHub developer portal. This platform's flexibility allows for seamless exports to numerous supported DSP and microcontroller formats, including the newly compatible Generalplus ICs.

Sensory’s new children’s speech recognizer unlocks an unparalleled level of accuracy and privacy for apps, toys, kid’s wearables, and education technologies
Santa Clara, Ca, Oct 5, 2021
–
Sensory Inc.
,
a recognized leader for Edge AI, announces the immediate availability of custom trained speech recognition models that understand the unique linguistic patterns associated with children’s speech. The new recognizer designed for kids’ voices, supports both Sensory’s
TrulyHandsfree
phrase spotting technology and
TrulyNatural
large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer. With this technology advancement developers of apps, children’s toys, kid’s wearables, and education technology can implement voice control technology with unparalleled accuracy and privacy due to Sensory’s AI-on-the-edge architecture.
Accurately recognizing children’s speech is challenging because it differs from adult speech in many ways. A scarcity of available training data makes this problem even more difficult to solve. Over many years Sensory collected and analyzed significant amounts of children’s speech to better understand and model the specifics of how children talk. Initial testing on a corpus of spontaneous kid’s speech, reveals up to a 33% reduction in word error rate, when compared to an adult speech recognition model.
“Sensory has some of most talented technologists in the speech industry,” stated Todd Mozer, CEO at Sensory. “We challenged the team to create a private and accurate recognizer for kid’s speech and they delivered. This opens up new and fun voice enabled products for kids of all ages.”
Generalplus Technology
, headquartered in Taiwan, is a worldwide supplier of integrated circuits for speech and toys. They have shipped millions of products with voice control.
“Sensory’s new kid’s speech recognition has already been integrated into several of our ICs and we are seeing strong interest from our customers,” said Jacky Chen, marketing manager at Generalplus.
Developers can now access child speech models, as well as Sensory’s industry-leading adult speech models, within Sensory’s
VoiceHub
developer portal. The flexibility of VoiceHub enables direct export to many supported DSP and microcontroller formats, including the newly added Generalplus ICs.
