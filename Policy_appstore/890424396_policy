Privacy Policy
phorest.me realises some people are unsure about entering their personal details into websites over the Internet.
Below, we explain how we use your information and how we protect your privacy.
phorest.me and its associated companies respect and protect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions
with this website. Any information which is provided by you to phorest.me via this website or otherwise
will be treated in accordance with the terms of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 and/or such
amending or replacement legislation as may be adopted in Ireland from time to time.
INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR BOOKING
For us to process a booking for you, we require some information from you.
This includes your name, your phone number, address and email address.
Also, since we confirm your booking while you are on the site, we require your credit or debit
card details so we can guarantee your booking when you pay your deposit.
WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION
We are required to send your information to the salon with which you booked salon services so
that the salon knows who you are and when you will use its salon services. We give your name,
your phone number, your address and your email address and of course, the details of your booking. The salon requires this
information to accept a confirmed booking from you. All salons on whose behalf we facilitate
bookings have agreed to the phorest.me terms and conditions and accept this privacy policy.
SECURITY
All sensitive information exchanged between your computer and our site is encrypted using SSL.
Our SSL Cert. is provided by Verisign. This ensures that your information is transmitted
securely and is safe from third parties.
You should be aware that where you link to another web site from this web site,
that phorest.me has no control over that other web site. Accordingly, phorest.me cannot
guarantee that the controller of that web site will respect your privacy in the same
manner as phorest.me
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We only use your email address for sending you a confirmation of your bookings or to contact
you for any reason directly linked to your booking, or occasionally to inform you of new
features on phorest.me. We only use your phone number to contact you urgently if there
is a problem with your booking.
You have the right to request a copy of the information which we hold about you
(for which we may charge you a small fee) and to have inaccuracies in the information corrected.
On occasions, we may supply statistics about our customers to third-parties such as salons
or salon service providers. These statistics never contain personally identifying information.
PHOREST ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SERVANTS AND AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIMS, EMERGENCIES, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION, DAMAGES,
LOSSES, EXPENSES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS OF
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE AND/OR DISSEMINATION OF
PERSONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO YOU IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CONSENT.
phorest.me reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend this Privacy and
Security Statement at any time and you should regularly check this privacy policy for any amendments.
