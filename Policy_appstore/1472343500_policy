(H) Profiling

(I) International transfer of Personal Data
We transfer Personal Data to recipients in other countries. Where we transfer Personal Data from the United Kingdom and/or the EEA to a recipient outside the United Kingdom/EEA that is not in an Adequate Jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of an International Data Transfer Agreement or Standard Contractual Clauses.
Because of the international nature of our business, we transfer Personal Data within the EcoOnline group, and to third parties as noted in Section (G) above, in connection with the purposes set out in this policy. For this reason, we transfer Personal Data to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.
If an exemption or derogation applies (e.g., where a transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim) we may rely on that exemption or derogation, as appropriate. Where no exemption or derogation applies, and we transfer your Personal Data from the United Kingdom or the EEA to recipients located outside the United Kingdom/EEA who are not in Adequate Jurisdictions, we do so on the basis of an International Data Transfer Agreement or Standard Contractual Clauses. You are entitled to request a copy of our International Data Transfer Agreement and Standard Contractual Clauses using the contact details provided in Section (Q) below.
Please note that when you transfer any Personal Data directly to an EcoOnline entity established outside the United Kingdom and the EEA, we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Data. We will nevertheless Process your Personal Data, from the point at which we receive those data, in accordance with the provisions of this policy.
(J) Data security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Data. Please ensure that any Personal Data that you send to us is sent securely.
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized access, and other unlawful or unauthorized forms of Processing, in accordance with applicable law.
Because the internet is an open system, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will implement all reasonable measures to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us using the internet – any such transmission is at your own risk, and you are responsible for ensuring that any Personal Data that you send to us is sent securely. Personal Data that you send to us is sent securely.
(K) Data accuracy
We take every reasonable step to ensure that your Personal Data is kept accurate and up-to-date and is erased or rectified if we become aware of inaccuracies.
We take every reasonable step to ensure that:
your Personal Data that we Process is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; and
any of your Personal Data that we Process that is inaccurate (having regard to the purposes for which it is Processed) is erased or rectified without delay.
From time to time, we may ask you to confirm the accuracy of your Personal Data.
As a Data Processor, we support our clients in updating personal data in our systems and applications when requested either manually or, where possible, through automated means such as synchronization.
(L) Data minimization
We take every reasonable step to limit the volume of your Personal Data that we Process to what is necessary.
We take every reasonable step to ensure that your Personal Data that we Process is limited to the Personal Data reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this policy.

We take every reasonable step to ensure that your Personal Data is only Processed for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this policy. The criteria for determining the duration for which we will retain your Personal Data is as follows:
1)    we will retain Personal Data in a form that permits identification only for as long as:
your Personal Data is necessary in connection with the lawful purposes set out in this policy, for which we have a valid legal basis (e.g., where your personal data is included in a contract between us and your employer, and we have a legitimate interest in processing that data for the purposes of operating our business and fulfilling our obligations under that contract; or where we have a legal obligation to retain your Personal Data),
we maintain an ongoing relationship with you (e.g., where you are a user of our services, or you are lawfully included in our mailing list and have not unsubscribed); or
Plus:
2)    the duration of:
any applicable limitation period under applicable law (i.e., any period during which any person could bring a legal claim against us in connection with your Personal Data, or to which your Personal Data is relevant); and
an additional twelve (12) month period following the end of such applicable limitation period (so that, if a person brings a claim at the end of the limitation period, we are still afforded a reasonable amount of time in which to identify any Personal Data that is relevant to that claim),
and:
2)    in addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we continue to Process Personal Data for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim.
During the periods noted in paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) above, we will restrict our Processing of your Personal Data to storage of, and maintaining the security of, that data, except to the extent that that data needs to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim, or any obligation under applicable law.
Once the periods in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above, each to the extent applicable, have concluded, we will either:
permanently delete or destroy the relevant Personal Data; or
anonymize the relevant Personal Data.
