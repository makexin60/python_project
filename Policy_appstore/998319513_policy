Web Site Usage Data
‚Äì With or without cookies, our web site keeps
                            track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from
                            (i.e., your IP address, domain name), date and time of the page request, the referring
                            web site (if any), and other parameters in the URL (e.g., search criteria). We use
                            this data to better understand web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what
                            areas our web site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas).
                            This information is stored in log files and used for aggregated and statistical
                            reporting. It is not attributed to you as an individual.
