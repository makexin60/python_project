PLEASE READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.
This privacy policy (this "
Privacy Policy
") describes the privacy practices of Evolution Nutrition, Inc. ("
Evolution Nutrition
," "
we
," or "
us
") with respect to how we collect, use and disclose the information we collect from you in connection with your use of our website, www.evolutionnutrition.com (our "
Site
"), and/or our software (the "
Evolution Nutrition Software
," and, together with Site, the "
Evolution Nutrition Services
"). Any capitalized terms used and not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in Evolution Nutrition's Terms of Use.
What Information We Collect and How We Use It
The information collected by Evolution Nutrition falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by users to our Site and the Evolution Nutrition Software (including information supplied by users when creating an account or using the "Public Areas") and (2) tracking information recorded by us as users navigate through our Site or use the Evolution Nutrition Software. Some of this information is "personally identifiable information," but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person.
To make use of some features on our Site, users may need to provide certain personal information to create an account. We may ask, for example, for your name, email address and street address. In addition, we may ask you for information about your gender, height, weight, fitness goals, weight goals, birthday, exercise routines, relationship status and the like. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, complete the particular function of our Site you are using, and tailor our Site to your interests to make it more useful to you. Our systems will remember some of this information the next time you log in and use our Site. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying this information is entirely voluntary. But if you choose not to supply the information, we may be unable to provide you with the products and services we make available to other users of our Site. And you will not be able to order selected products or services, or make payments, over our Site unless you provide certain personally identifiable information about yourself. When you submit any personally identifiable information over this Site, Evolution Nutrition (1) will use the information for the purposes described at the time you submit it (for example, your name, street address, telephone number and email address provided while ordering one of our products or services will be used in connection with the processing and fulfillment of your order) and (2) may use the information to contact you to make you aware of other products and services of interest. Of course, if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the publicly available content on our Site without creating an account.
In connection with the standard operation of Site, certain non-personally identifiable information about users of this Site is recorded. This information is used primarily to tailor and enhance users' experience using our Site. We may use this information in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to, among other matters, measure the use of our Site and determine which products and services are the most popular with Site users.
What We Disclose and Who We Disclose It To
We consider the personally identifiable information that you provide to us as confidential. Note, however, that information you post in Public Areas is not considered confidential and is available to everyone. We may sometimes disclose both confidential and nonconfidential personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates or to others who work for us. We may also disclose personally identifiable information about you to service providers and vendors, and to others who provide products and services to us. For example, when you use certain functions on this Site you may notice that the website actually collecting or processing the information may be a website other than our Site. We may be required by law or legal process to disclose certain personally identifiable information about you to lawyers and parties in connection with litigation and to law enforcement personnel. For example, we may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent and without notice in order to comply with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.
Changing Your Information and Settings
If you create an account, you can update or otherwise change the information that you have provided to us by logging in to your account and changing the information directly.
How We Collect Informatio
n
To help make our Site more responsive to the needs of our users, we use a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie." We use cookies to help us tailor our Site to your needs, to deliver better, more personalized service, and to remember certain choices you've made so you don't have to re-enter them. We use two kinds of cookies: (1) temporary or "session"-based cookies that contain certain information about a user's use of our Site at a particular time and (2) "persistent" cookies that contain certain account-related information about a user's use of our Site. Session-based cookies are automatically disabled or deleted when a user of our Site closes his or her browser software at the end of session. Persistent cookies remain stored on a registered user's computer system until he or she disables or deletes them. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies or you delete them, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our Site.
The cookies we use don't directly identify users of our Site as particular persons. Rather, they contain information sufficient to simplify and improve a user's experience on our Site. For example, we may use session-based cookies to track the pages on our Site visited by our users. We can build a better Site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Or, for example, we may use persistent cookies to simplify access to a user's account information over our Site.
Third Party Websites
Our website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Evolution Nutrition.
Changes to Evolution Nutrition's Corporate Structure
User information, including without limitation your confidential and nonconfidential personally identifiable information, may be disclosed and/or transferred as part of a restructuring, reorganization, merger or acquisition of Evolution Nutrition or the sale of Evolution Nutrition's assets, as well as in the unlikely event of Evolution Nutrition's insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.

For example, Evolution Nutrition is required to disclose Medical Information if it is compelled to do so under court order or search warrant. Evolution Nutrition may also disclose Medical Information, without a consumer's written authorization, to health care professionals involved in the consumer's care, to a family member involved with the consumer's care or payment related to the consumer's care, to an entity assisting Evolution Nutrition with its administrative services, to governmental oversight agencies, to a third party for purposes of anonymizing or encrypting the data, and in certain other specified circumstances permitted or required under applicable state and federal law.
