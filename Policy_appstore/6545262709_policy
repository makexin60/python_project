Who we are and Scope of this Policy
HypGames is the worldwide leader in digital sports entertainment.
​
We are committed to providing fun and exciting digital entertainment. This Privacy Policy explains how and what personal data relating to you we may use in relation to:
Services through Apple Arcade
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. The Services also are subject to our
Terms of Service
, and any other policies included in our Services.
If you contact us or use our services outside of Apple Arcade, our general
Privacy Policy
will apply.
What data does HypGames collect from you?
The types of information that we collect depend on how you use the Services and interact with us. We do not collect any personal information from you through these Services. The Services collect gameplay information to manage your settings, game progress, and in-game activity or achievements.  If you choose to connect with Game Center to sync your game progress across devices, gameplay information will be sent to Apple.
What does HypGames do with this data?
If a player chooses to Opt-in to Share Information, the Services collect gameplay information to manage your settings, game progress, and in-game activity or achievements.
Children's privacy
Our Services are not specifically targeted at children.
Where the Services are being used by children under the age of 13, we recommend parents and guardians regularly take the time to communicate and educate their children about interactive online entertainment.
What does HypGames do to protect data?
We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures to safeguard the data we process from loss, misuse, and alteration and to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and to ensure that we correctly use the data we hold in accordance with the purposes for which we collected that data.
​
We use industry-standard practices such as encryption, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information that we might collect from you. For example, your email address and password will be encrypted which will make it very difficult for someone to discover and use them without our authorization. We also strive to limit access to your data to employees performing a legitimate business function which requires them to access and use your data in order to supply you with our Services. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods to ensure we continue to protect your data.
While we will do our best to protect your data, the transmission of information by you to us over the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of data during its transfer over the Internet to us. Any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use the procedures and security features outlined in this section to try to prevent any unauthorized access.
How long does HypGames keep hold of data?
We will keep data only for as long as it is relevant per Apple Arcade Policy.  After 2 years of account inactivity all data is deleted. Additionally, a player can choose to Delete All Data from the Settings menu.

What can I do if I have a complaint?
If you are not satisfied with the way your query or complaint is handled by HypGames, please let us know by emailing us at

If we change this Privacy Policy in a material way, we will provide appropriate notice to you and, as appropriate, provide additional choices regarding such change.

We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures to safeguard the data we process from loss, misuse, and alteration and to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and to ensure that we correctly use the data we hold in accordance with the purposes for which we collected that data.

for information regarding retention periods.
​
What data is shared with or accessed by third parties?
HypGames will share your data with various third parties (including our affiliate companies in other countries) as follows:
We use third parties to help us manage your information and the Services, such as our cloud service provider, customer service and technical support provider, software and game developers, marketing delivery companies and IT maintenance providers. These are companies who are authorized to process data on our behalf only as necessary to provide the relevant services to us and cannot use it for their own independent purposes.
Some games available via our websites are only "iFramed". This means that, while such content looks like it is on our websites, it does not belong to us and is served by a third-party game developer and links to their site. In such instances your use of those games will be subject to their terms and conditions and privacy policy. However, the data you provide to them may also be shared with us and be subject to this Privacy Policy as well. We will let you know when you are playing an "iFramed" game through a pop-up message.
We share your data with our third party payment providers where you have specifically asked us to complete any in-app or in-game purchases. These third-party payment providers may also ask us to share your data with them to confirm the nature of any payment transaction and to verify your identity and payment details.
You may create a profile for certain Services which may be visible to other users. Other users can choose to add you as a friend. You can change your settings through the 'edit profile' function in our Services at any time.
We or our third-party partners may disclose your personal data where we are required or permitted to do so by law or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party. We may also share your data with third parties to prevent fraud, abusive or unlawful behavior or to demonstrate our compliance with other terms or laws.
HypGames may disclose your information to third parties in connection with a purchase, transfer or sale of HypGames.
If you choose to access any Services through a third party platform such as Facebook or Google, then that third party may collect other information about you (including about your use of the Services) in accordance with its terms and own privacy policy and sometimes they share some data with us. They have their own privacy settings which you can access on that third party platform in order to change your preferences.
​
We require any third parties processing your data on our behalf to process it in accordance with your rights, our instructions and applicable law.
​
Third party advertising companies
We want to make sure that the advertising on our Services and marketing is relevant and interesting to you and our other customers.
To achieve this, we use third-party advertising and technology companies to serve ads and/or provide aggregated data to assist in serving ads when you visit or use our Services. This includes third party technology companies which collect data about you in order to build a profile of your preferences based on your activities when you visit or use our Services. We also use these companies to automatically collect data from you when you use our Services in order to help us identify the ads that are served to you and what you do after seeing those ads. In addition, we share data with providers of web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, which we use to analyze your use of the Services.
​
These third party advertising companies collect, store and use data by integrating cookies, tracking code and other software in our Services. The relevant data collected by these third parties will vary but may include your unique device ID, geo-location details, advertising ID, IP address, information on your interaction with advertising, browsing history and other technical information. Data which you provide to HypGames when using our Services may also be captured by these third parties.
​
On our apps, these third party advertising companies will collect and use your data to provide you with targeted advertising that is relevant to you and your preferences with your consent. You can control and withdraw your consent at any time by visiting the game settings page of our apps. If you do not provide or withdraw your consent to receive targeted advertising on our apps, or if we know you are under the age of 13, then we will still serve you advertising when you visit or use our Services but this will no longer be tailored to you or your preferences.
​
On our websites, we rely on our legitimate interests to allow third party advertising companies to collect and use your data to provide you with targeted advertising that is relevant to you and your preferences. Nonetheless, you can still control and disable such targeted advertising by visiting the settings page of our websites. If you disable targeted advertising on our websites, or if we know you are under the age of 13, then we will still serve you advertising when you visit or use our Services but this will no longer be tailored to you or your preferences.
​
In some cases the third parties advertising companies that we work with will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.
Advertising our products on third party websites and mobile
We will also share your data with social media or other similar platforms, so that you and other people can see relevant content on that platform. For example, we may use the Facebook Custom Audiences service and share your Facebook ID or advertising ID in a protected format with Facebook so that we can: include you in a custom audience that we will serve relevant advertising content to on Facebook; or create an audience of other Facebook users based on the information in your Facebook profile. You can opt-out from Facebook Custom Audiences in your Facebook privacy settings.
​
We will also share your data with user acquisition partners, via our third party mobile measurement service provider, for the purpose of telling you via third party applications about our new products, promotions and features that may be of interest to you.  We will also work with these partners to monitor the success of such campaigns.  You can object to such use in accordance with the "How do I erase or restrict or update my data?" below.
​
Children's privacy
Most of our Services are not specifically targeted at children. Where the Services are being used by children under the age of 13, we recommend parents and guardians regularly clear their browser cache and/or browsing history to clear cookies.
​
For some Services however it may be possible for those under the age of 13 to register an account and access games and other content (with parental or guardian consent). Where children under 13 sign up and use our Services, their account is limited to those aspects of the Services which we deem appropriate for children.
​
If you are under 13 and have signed up to use any of our Services, we will only collect and process the following limited data about you:
your date of birth and email address. We collect, use and store this data as it is necessary in order to allow you to log-in and use the Services you have registered for. We need to use your date of birth to make sure that users are not attempting to access Services which we deem inappropriate; and
data which is necessary to respond to a question or one-off request for customer service support from you. We believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data for this purpose as it allows us to provide you with customer and technical support and a better experience of our Services and the benefits of this outweigh any potential impact on you in storing and using your personal information in this way.
​
If you are under the age of 13 and in the EEA, your email address is encrypted. This means that your email address will be put into a secret code, so no one can use it, including us.
​
As your email address is encrypted, we are not able to contact you by email after registration for any purpose, including to send service emails or promotional offers.
For parents/guardians:
If you would like to review or amend your child's information, ask to have it deleted, and/or refuse to allow any further collection or use of your child's information, then please send an email to our Data Protection Officer at
Support@HypGames.com
. Please be sure to include your email address and a telephone number where we can reach you. To protect your child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting you access to the information that we collect and maintain about your child.
​
We recommend that parents take the time to communicate and educate their children about Internet Safety.
​
How do I erase or restrict or update my data?
If you no longer wish for us to use your data, please get in touch. Please note that this may affect the provision of our Services to you, for example, you may not be able to enter any competitions or make any in game purchases.
​
You have the right to ask us to amend or update any of your data which is out of date or incorrect, or change the way we may use your data.
​
You also have the right to ask us to delete any personal information which we are holding about you. You can also object to our processing of data about you, and we will consider any valid objections which you raise. In certain circumstances we may not be able to stop using your personal data but, if that is the case, we'll let you know and tell you why.
​
If you wish to opt out of receiving any promotional emails or newsletters you can do so by clicking on the "unsubscribe here" link at the bottom of each email. To change or delete push notifications, visit the settings section on your device and select the appropriate setting, or change the settings on your browser if you are accessing any of our websites.
​
If you have an account with us, in certain games, you can view and edit your profile to change the settings in order to prevent others being able to add you as a friend.
​
If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please get in touch with us by emailing
Support@HypGames.com
.
​
How do I get a copy of my data?
You have the right to ask us to provide you with copies of personal data that we hold about you at any time. Please contact us by emailing
Support@HypGames.com
