Re-programming
If I change vehicle can I have the tuning box remapped? Yes! We can reprogram your current Bluespark tuning box and set it up for another compatible vehicle. This includes modifying or replacing the existing wiring loom if necessary. This service is only valid for existing customers and does not include CR Tech 1 or other modules with round wiring harness to tuning box connectors. We cannot reconfigure second hand or third party units. If you have purchased a second hand unit you will need to have the original purchaser arrange the reprogramming. A tuning box can only be reprogrammed for the common rail diesel and turbo petrol engines listed on our website.
