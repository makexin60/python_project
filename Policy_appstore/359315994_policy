Doesn't Work
I really likes this game but until the last update it doesn't work :( iPod Touch 4th gen.
Get it
It's easy to understand. It's just like unlocking your iPhone/pod/pad. If you don't get this app you're missing out.
Crash!
I just downloaded this app and after
The second slide, it freezes. Plz
Fix this.
