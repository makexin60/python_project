What is personal information?
Personal information is any information that could be used to identify you or another individual.
We collect personal information from you in a number of different ways; you may share that information with us, or we may collect it using other means.
What personal information do we collect?
Information you share with us
We collect personal information that you share with us when you contact us or interact with us through our website, apps, email, phone or otherwise.
You can decide not to provide certain information or ask that any information you have previously shared is removed.
Through these interactions you may share with us: your name, address, email address, telephone number and payment information. You may also share details of other people; for example, if you have bought a Motocaddy product for that other person or if you register another person for a Motocaddy app. In those circumstances, you will need to check with that person that they are happy for you to share their personal information with us, and for us to use it in accordance with this privacy policy.
Information from Motocaddy products and apps
As well as the personal information you share with us about yourself and your Motocaddy product, we may collect and handle personal information directly from your Motocaddy connected products and Motocaddy apps. A connected product is a Motocaddy product that is “Smart”, internet enabled or operated through a Motocaddy app.
We may collect information about your use of our connected products or apps, to help us optimise their performance and your experience of using them. We may also collect Internet Protocol (IP) and/or Media Access Control (MAC) identifier information about your mobile device.
Some of the information we collect from your use of our connected products and apps may enable us to determine the location of your connected product. This data is collected so that we can understand the location and environmental conditions in which your connected product is operating; for example, by giving an indication of the environment in which it operates, which helps us to optimise the performance of the connected product. Some of our connected products may not be able to operate without collecting location information, or other personal information, and so by registering for the app and using a connected product you agree to this use of the information.
Information from your online interactions
We collect and handle information from all visitors to our websites, whether you actively provide us with that information or merely browse our websites. The information we collect includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device you are using, the browser software you use, your operating system, the date and time of access, the internet address of the website from which you link through to our website and information on how you use our websites.
We use this information so that we can see how long our websites take to load, how they are used, the number of visitors to the different sections of our websites, and what information visitors look at most. We also collect and handle information about how you engage with our promotional campaigns and advertising online, outside of our own websites; for example, on Google, YouTube or on social media.
That information is, predominantly, collected through our use of cookies and similar technologies.
Cookies
Cookies are files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to the device you use when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies do lots of different and useful jobs, such as remembering your preferences, and generally improving your online experience.
There are different types of cookies. They all work in the same way, but have minor differences:
Session cookies
- Session cookies last only for the duration of your visit and are deleted when you close your browser. These facilitate various tasks such as allowing a website to identify that a user of a particular device is navigating from page to page, supporting website security or basic functionality.
Persistent cookies
- Persistent cookies last after you have closed your browser and allow a website to remember your actions and preferences. Sometimes persistent cookies are used by websites to provide targeted advertising based upon the browsing history of the device.
First and third party cookies
- Whether a cookie is a first or third party cookie depends on which website the cookie comes from. First party cookies are those set by or on behalf of the website visited. All other cookies are third party cookies.
Strictly necessary cookies
- These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as adding items to the shopping cart, or logging into your account cannot be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you for the purposes of marketing.
Performance cookies
- These cookies collect information about how visitors use a web site, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor although they may collect the IP address of the device used to access the site. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how a website works, the user experience and to optimise the website.
By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device, however you can block cookies using your browser settings.

The information we share with those third parties includes some of the information that you share with us (such as, your contact details and information about the transaction), and some of the information from your online interactions (such as the IP address of your device). That information is used to determine whether a transaction could be fraudulent.
We will also share your personal information if we are required to do so by law, including in response to a legal process, such as a court order, or to comply with other national, state, provincial or local laws.
We take responsibility for the personal information that you share with us and require those third parties with whom we share your personal information to apply the same level of privacy protection as is contained in this privacy policy.

We are committed to protecting your personal information. We use appropriate technical and organisational measures, including encryption, to protect your personal information and privacy, and review those regularly.

Third parties who provide services on our behalf
We share your personal information with certain third parties who provide services on our behalf. They only have access to the personal information they need to perform those services. They are required to keep your personal information confidential and may not use it other than as we ask them to and always in accordance with this privacy policy.
The third parties who provide services on our behalf fall into the following category:
Our distributors, who help us to sell our products in certain countries;
Those helping us to deliver products to you;
Third parties that help us with mailing services, product services and repairs, processing product purchases, financial services, audit services, administrative services, IT technologies (e.g. data storage), security services and insurance claims;
Third parties that help us to provide services and responses to you;

Social media platforms who serve our advertising on their platforms on our behalf (and who we may securely share your personal information with in order to serve this advertising to both you and/or others)
Other third parties
We also share certain personal information with third parties who help us to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. The information we share with those third parties includes some of the information that you share with us (such as, your contact details and information about the transaction), and some of the information from your online interactions (such as the IP address of your device). That information is used to determine whether a transaction could be fraudulent.
We will also share your personal information if we are required to do so by law, including in response to a legal process, such as a court order, or to comply with other national, state, provincial or local laws.
We take responsibility for the personal information that you share with us and require those third parties with whom we share your personal information to apply the same level of privacy protection as is contained in this privacy policy.
Interaction of connected products with third party products
We have added functionality to some of our products which, for example, allows your Motocaddy product to interact with certain third party products. However, the products will only interact if you want them to, by enabling the relevant functionality.
Links to third party websites
We may provide links to other websites which are not operated and controlled by Motocaddy.
We have no control over and are not responsible for the content of those sites or how the third parties responsible for them collect and use your personal information. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party websites.
Third party websites may have their own privacy policies explaining how they use and share your personal information. You should carefully review those privacy policies before you use these websites to make sure that you are happy with how your personal information is being collected and shared.
How long do we keep your personal information?
We only keep your personal information for as long as we need to, to be able to use it for the reasons given in this privacy policy, and for as long as we are required to keep it by law.
Your controls and choices
We give you control over the personal information we collect about you, to ensure it is accurate and reflects your preferences. For more information on how to change the way that we contact you, see section titled ‘Opt-In/Opt-Out’.
You have the right to access, update and amend personal information that we hold about you. If the law in your country allows us to impose a fee for giving you access, we will communicate this to you in response to your request.
In certain circumstances, you can also:
Object to our use of your personal information for certain purposes;
Ask us to limit or restrict our use of your personal information;
Ask us to remove or delete personal information about you;
Provide your personal information to a third party provider of services

How do we protect your personal information?
We are committed to protecting your personal information. We use appropriate technical and organisational measures, including encryption, to protect your personal information and privacy, and review those regularly. We protect your personal information using a combination of physical and IT security controls, including access controls that restrict and manage the way in which your personal information and data is processed, managed, and handled. We also ensure that our staff are adequately trained in protecting your personal information. Our procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we share your personal information with you.
In the unlikely event that we do suffer a security breach which compromises our protection of your personal information, and we need to let you know about it, we will do so.
Data transfers, storage and the global handling of your personal information
The Motocaddy headquarters are located in the United Kingdom (UK) .
We collect personal information in the country in which you live. We then host and store that information in the European Economic Area (EEA). Those third parties that we share your personal information with may handle or transfer your personal information outside of the UK, and outside of the EEA, to other countries in which they have facilities.
We will make sure that both any transfer of your personal information by us or by the third parties that we share your personal information with, and our handling of your personal information, complies with those laws which apply to us. In any case, our transfer, storage, and handling of your personal information will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.
By submitting your personal information to us, and by using our websites, apps or connected products, you agree to us transferring, storing, and handling your personal information in this way.
Children
Motocaddy’s websites, apps and products are not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
If you are a child, please do not attempt to become a registered user of our websites, apps or products or otherwise provide us with any personal information. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information from a child, we will delete that information as soon as possible.
If you are aware of a child who has provided their personal information to us, please contact us at
