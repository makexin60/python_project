Preface
Recognizing that the Bible is the very Word of the Living God to man, and understanding the priority of knowing and obeying its truths, Grace to You is committed to teaching Scripture with diligence and authority.
Thus, the central ministry of Grace to You is the continuous imparting of biblical truth to the people of God that they may become equipped to do the work of the ministry.
This statement presents our convictions regarding the theological truths of the Bible, built on years of study and teaching. They are the primary doctrines of the Christian faith, and they reflect the heart of the teaching of Grace to You.
