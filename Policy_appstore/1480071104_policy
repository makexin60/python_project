About Ad Settings
We and our 878 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.
Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest.
View our list of partners
to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
Purposes
6
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data. You can object to legitimate interest processing per purpose.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).
Vendors
708
Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Vendors
655
Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.

Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.

Privacy Policy
Please read this privacy policy carefully.
We are Precision Nutrition Inc. of 18 King Street East, Suite 1400, Toronto, ON, M5C 1C4. (“Precision” or “we”, “us”, “our”). We recognize the importance of privacy and the sensitivity of personal information (
defined below
). Precision is subject to various privacy statutes, including Canada's federal
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act,
all substantially similar provincial legislation, and the European Union’s
General Data Protection Regulation
(collectively, the “Privacy Laws”).
This Privacy Policy outlines how we safeguard and manage the personal information that you submit to us or that your personal coach provides to us about you. We are the data controller of personal information that we may collect, process and hold about you, unless we advise you otherwise.
Your Privacy Rights
Under the Privacy Laws, Precision is required to collect, use and disclose personal information only by lawful and fair means. To ensure this accountability, we have developed this policy, and trained our staff about our policies and practices.
What is “personal information”?
Personal information is any information that identifies you, or by which your identity could be deduced.
What Types of Services does Precision Offer?
Precision Nutrition Certification And Professional Development Programs - Training to Become a (Better) Fitness / Nutrition Coach
Level 1 Certification Program
– this is a self-paced or instructor-led training program for fitness / nutrition coaching that gives a basic overview of fitness, nutrition and coaching principles. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for this program.
Level 2 Certification Program
– this is a cohort-based program (meaning that it is an online class conducted at set times and for a set duration during the year) specializing in advanced fitness and nutrition coaching skills and strategies. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for this program.
Professional Development programs
- These are self-paced, evidence-based training programs for developing or deepening coaching and subject matter knowledge. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for these programs.
ProCoach Service - Independent Third Party ProCoaches and Their Clients
This is a program offered to independent third party fitness / nutrition coaches whereby they use our online software platform and curriculum materials as tools to develop their own fitness / nutrition programs for coaching their clients. The ProCoaches and their clients have separate contractual arrangements between them for the coaching services of the ProCoach.  There are two aspects to data handling in this situation to note:
With respect to the personal information that Precision collects about the ProCoaches themselves, Precision is the controller and processor of the data.
Where the ProCoach asks a client to set up an account with Precision to follow the ProCoach’s program, with respect to the personal information that Precision receives from that client, Precision is the processor of the ProCoach client data, but the ProCoach is the controller of the data about his or her clients.
Precision Nutrition Coaching Program - Online Coaching for Individuals
This is a program whereby individuals join our online Precision Nutrition Coaching Program for fitness and nutrition coaching by Precision’s own coaches. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for this program.
Sage by PN / Sage by Precision Nutrition - An AI-assisted Precision Nutrition Coaching Program
This is an app that uses advanced AI technology, and 15 years of PN experience, to coach people to reach their wellness goals as quickly as possible. Coaching is automated. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for this program.
What types of personal information do
we collect?
If you sign up for our Precision Nutrition Coaching Program or a Precision Nutrition Certification Program, you will be required to provide your name, email address, and mobile phone number.  At the time of registration you will be asked to provide payment card information (including your credit card number, expiry date, and CVC/CVV) in order to register; however, this payment card information is sent directly to our payment card processor.  Precision only receives a random electronic token over an encrypted connection from the payment processor that confirms the transaction has been completed.  We do not receive a copy of your payment card information.
If you are a client of a ProCoach, your ProCoach will forward to us your name, email address and program type for us to invite you to sign up.
If you have registered for the Precision Nutrition Coaching Program you will need to provide additional information such as alternate contact information, your full home address, date of birth, gender, ethnicity, physical measurements or attributes, and other more detailed information about your lifestyle (including but not limited to: employment, preferences, habits, personal routine) in order create a program account. Precision will also collect limited medical information about your health and well-being in order to better assess and develop a structured coaching program to help you meet your fitness and health goals. This additional information is considered sensitive data, and is treated as such, requiring your explicit consent for us to collect this information.  We will also require confirmation from you that your doctor has approved your following our program or if you are not able to provide this confirmation, we will require that you sign this a medical waiver, which will be supplied to you at the time of collection of your personal information.  If you are a ProCoach client, your ProCoach may ask us to collect some or all of the additional information described above on his or her behalf.  You should check with your ProCoach on the ProCoach’s privacy policy for how he or she will be using and disclosing this information.
As a tool to help you assess your progress, Precision will ask you to upload photographs of yourself periodically and to provide your measurements, including girth measurements and weight (around once a month). Uploading of photographs is optional and you can request that they be anonymized. The measurement recording feature is similarly optional.  You can choose to stop uploading photos or providing measurements at any time. Should you choose to upload photos or measurements, these photos will only be viewed by Precision coaching staff or, if these photos have been requested by your personal ProCoach coach, then they may be viewed by your ProCoach and will not be otherwise used or disclosed unless you provide your express permission for Precision to do so. Please check with your ProCoach on the ProCoach’s privacy policy to find out how he or she will be using and disclosing these photographs.
If you register for either of our Precision Nutrition Certification Programs, we will need your shipping address in order to provide you with a textbook.  We will also ask you to provide other information around your experience and credentials as a health and fitness professional.
If you are purchasing any of our PN Guides, we will need your full name, company, phone number(s), email, and shipping and billing address in order to effect the transaction and send you the product. As noted above, our third party payment processor will collect payment card information directly from you on our behalf, but we will receive a random electronic token confirming the transaction.  In addition, Precision will ask if you are a fitness professional or if you otherwise work in fitness.
Note: If you are a client of a ProCoach, you and the ProCoach will enter into a separate contractual arrangement that does not involve Precision.  Precision is not responsible for and disclaims all warranties and liabilities with respect to your contractual arrangements with your ProCoach, including, without limitation, any payment arrangements to which you and your ProCoach may agree.
Children
Our products and services are not intended for or available to children under the age of 18 years.  If you are under the age of 18 years, please exit our website.
