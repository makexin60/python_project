Our commitment
Protecting your privacy is of utmost importance to us. Therefore, complying
with the statutory data
privacy
regulations forms a natural
foundation
of
our

It is,
however,
moreover paramount to us
that
you at all times know which personal data we gather, why we gather it, and how we process it. We will be h
appy
to explain to you what rights you have and how to exercise them
, as well.
What is personal d
ata?
To put it briefly, anything whereby you, as an individual, can be identified, whether due to the inf
ormation itself
or in connection with other information. Examples of this include your name, e-mail address, or als
o a customer
ID, but even the
point
in time
at which
you visit our website
if that
is saved together
with
your
IP address.
We
constantly endeavour
to
gather
as
little
personal
data as
possible.
Simultaneously, we
are informing
you
in
this
document, in depth, on your personal data, if we gat
her any.
Why is this document so l
ong?
The legislative authority requires us to describe the following to you in regard to all personal da
ta individually:
-
-
-
-
-
-
which personal data we gather (= the nature of the data
gathered)
which law or ordinance or regulation permits us to do so (= the
legal basis)
why we gather said data (= the inten
ded use)
what exactly happens to your data (= the nature of th
e processing)
how long we save your pers
onal data
what rights you have in regard to your personal data (= the rights of d
ata subjects)
We need to list all the steps individually. This is why this document is very e
xtensive.

legitimate interests
on
our par

on
the par
t
of a
third
party,
as
long

your

ecessary, do not
outweigh the latter
.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
