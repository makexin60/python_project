Macquarie Group Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy
The Macquarie Group respects the privacy of the people we deal with, and we uphold high standards of privacy practice and security. This policy explains how we handle personal information and how we interact with you online.
Whenever we handle personal information, we take steps to ensure that appropriate standards of privacy practice and security are applied.
The Macquarie Group Privacy Policy sets out why we need to collect personal information, how we collect it, what we do with it, how it is stored and who we might share it with. The Policy also describes how you can access or correct information we hold about you, how you can ask further questions or make a complaint, and information about our websites and online activities.
The information we collect
For most products and services, it is necessary for us to collect 'personal information' such as your name, identity details, photos, contact details and transaction information. We may also need to collect other personal details (such as gender, marital status and financial information) and other information from which you can be identified.
Applications
Employment Applications
We collect personal information from you if you apply for a job with the Macquarie Group. Please read the
Career Privacy Policy
for more information.
Credit Applications
Our
Credit Information Policy
sets out details of our collection and other handling of personal credit information, including collection of credit information from credit reporting bodies as well as our disclosure of credit information to credit reporting bodies. This applies mostly to our Australian credit products such as credit cards and loans.
Your information
Health Information
We collect your health information where we offer you products with an insurance component or in assessing certain claims, including hardship. We do not use or share that information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of your policy, claim or account, or as otherwise notified to you at the time we collect your information.
Sensitive Information
Generally, we do not collect sensitive information about you unless required or permitted by law or where you consent for us to do so. Sensitive information will only be collected if it is relevant to your product or the service or function you are engaging us to provide. If applicable, this will be communicated to you. For example, some forms of biometric data are collected, stored, and used to support access and verification procedures as well as fraud prevention.
We will not collect sensitive information about you where this is expressly prohibited by local law.
Sensitive information includes information relating to:
race
political or religious beliefs
sexual orientation and sexual life
criminal convictions
membership of professional or trade associations or unions
biometric and health information
information about your affiliation with certain organisations, such as professional associations.
Why we collect personal information
We collect personal information about you which is reasonably necessary to:
provide you with quality products, services or transaction opportunities. This may include consumer facing services conducted by Macquarie Bank Limited and/or its related entities (such as consumer banking, insurance or wealth advisory services) or services, advice or investment activity provided and/or undertaken by entities involved in the various corporate advisory and investment activities undertaken by Macquarie Group Limited and its related entities
consider applications and approaches you make to us
conduct marketing and social functions
maintain your contact details
fulfil our legal obligations, such as those relating to taxation, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, comprehensive consumer credit reporting under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, to prevent fraud, or as otherwise authorised by you.
Without such information, we may not be able to process your application or provide you with an appropriate level of service.  In such circumstances, we will process your application to the extent possible, and provide you with the most appropriate level of service that we can.
How we collect your information
We collect personal information about you directly from you — this can be in person, in documents you give us, from telephone calls, emails, competitions you enter, your access to our website or from transactions you make including via mobile banking. We take reasonable steps to be transparent about how and why we collect personal data.
We may also collect your personal information from joint account holder(s) or third parties including public sources, your adviser(s), employer (or its affiliates), agents, introducers, referrers, brokers, our related companies and service providers (including credit reporting bodies, fraud and financial crime information exchanges and other information service providers).
How we store your information
We keep personal information in physical and electronic records, at our premises and the premises of our service providers, which may include processing or storage in the cloud, which may mean in practice that this information is stored outside the country in which it is collected. Where this occurs, we take steps to protect the security and integrity of personal information.
We also keep records of our interactions with you (including by telephone, email and online) and of your transaction history.
How we use your information
We use personal information about you for the purpose for which it was provided to us, including to:
process applications
administer and manage our products and services (including monitoring, auditing, and evaluating those products and services)
model and test data (in a controlled environment)
develop scores, risk assessments and related analytical tools
communicate with you and deal with or investigate any complaints or enquiries.
We may also:
anonymise your data for our own purposes including market research and new product development
use personal information about you for the prevention and mitigation of fraud and other financial crimes
use or permit our affiliates to use your personal information for related purposes to the extent that it is lawful to do so without your express permission. For example, we may from time to time use your personal information to inform you or your employer of investment opportunities or to provide information about products and services which we expect may be of interest to you. However, if you don't want to receive such communications you can tell us by using any of the methods listed below.
While we may sometimes - where it is lawful and with your permission if necessary - share personal information with companies we do business with (e.g., in product development, joint venture arrangements or distribution arrangements), we do not sell personal information for marketing purposes to other organisations or allow such companies to do this.
When your information is disclosed
Subject in all cases to local law, we may share personal information within the Macquarie Group, and may disclose personal information outside the Macquarie Group:
to our service providers, who provide services in connection with our products and services (including archival, auditing, accounting, customer contact, legal, business consulting, banking, payment, delivery, data processing, data analysis, information broking, mailing, marketing, research, investigation, insurance, identity verification, brokerage, maintenance, trustee, securitisation, website and technology services)
to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations imposed by regulators including those under anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws or laws relating to comprehensive consumer credit reporting, or reasonably arising in connection with legal proceedings.
to our affiliates
to your nominated financial adviser with your permission
for the prevention and mitigation of fraud and other financial crimes
as contained in the terms and conditions of any specific product or service.
We may also disclose your personal information (on a confidential basis) in connection with our operating business and principal investment activities including, but not limited to:
mergers and acquisitions,
the management of any parts of our business assets (including divestments and reorganisation)
the provision of any debt to another party.
In some circumstances the parties to whom we disclose personal information may operate outside of Australia or, in the case of data collected within the United Kingdom or European Union, outside the United Kingdom and European Union — this includes locations in the countries listed in the Appendix. Where this occurs, we take steps to protect personal information against misuse or loss and to comply with local law in respect of the transfer of your data from one jurisdiction to another. Those parties, in turn, may make such information available to the governments of such other countries in accordance with local law requirements.
Keeping information accurate and up to date
We take reasonable steps to ensure that all information we hold is as accurate as possible. You are able to contact us at any time and ask for its correction if you feel the information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete.
Keeping information secure
We use security procedures and technology to protect the information we hold. Access to and use of personal information within Macquarie Group seeks to prevent misuse or unlawful disclosure of the information — this includes internal policies, auditing, training and monitoring of staff.
If other organisations provide support services, we require them to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure the privacy of the information provided to them.
How you can access or correct your information
You can contact us to request access to or correction of your personal information. In normal circumstances we will give you full access or make the requested corrections to your information. However, there may be some legal or administrative reasons to deny these requests. If your request is denied, we will provide you with the reason why (if we can). Where we decide not to make a requested correction to your personal information and you disagree, you may ask us to make a note of your requested correction with the information.

Careers Privacy Policy
At Macquarie, we want our people to feel supported in their career journey, and that starts with the recruitment process. When you share your information with us, we want you to feel confident that you understand how we will collect, use and store it.
As the information that you share will be different depending on where you are in your recruitment journey, the way we manage and store your data may also change. There is more information on this below, but if you have any questions, you can contact us by email (
privacy@macquarie.com
), phone (
+61 2 8550 5777
) or post (Macquarie Careers, GPO Box 4294 Sydney NSW 1164 Australia).
Your information
There are many ways you could share your information with us during the recruitment process, from registering your interest in Macquarie events or employment opportunities, submitting an application or CV, taking part in a video or in-person interview, or even subscribing to
content
about Macquarie.
The information you supply may be limited to your contact details, or could include other additional information, such as your application data, right to work status and educational history. It may also include other personal information that you choose to provide (such as
gender identity
or
information
about adjustments or accommodations you may be seeking). We refer to all of this data as 'your information'.
Collection, use and disclosure
Macquarie respects your privacy and security and will only collect, use and disclose your information where it is necessary to administer the recruitment process, send you the updates and information you’ve subscribed to such as Macquarie content or events, or where Macquarie has another legitimate interest in processing your information. These are some practical examples of legitimate purposes:
to assess your application for a role (including conducting psychometric assessment and reference checks);
to communicate with you in relation to your application or other suitable roles with Macquarie;
to comply with legal and / or regulatory obligations;
to prepare internal reporting; and
to monitor and review Macquarie's recruitment practices to make sure they meet candidate expectations and are working as expected.
If you’re successful in securing a role, then your information will also be collected, used and disclosed as needed in relation to your employment or engagement with Macquarie.
In carrying out the above activities, your information may be controlled and processed by Macquarie staff as well as those we work with. This includes Macquarie's officers, affiliates, agents, contractors and service providers worldwide.
Where it is necessary for your information to be transferred to other locations, Macquarie will take steps to protect your information against misuse or loss and will comply with any relevant local law requirements.
Storage
If you apply for a role and your application is unsuccessful, Macquarie may retain your information on file for three years, subject to any local laws or regulatory expectations that are applicable in the location for that role.
Macquarie may use this information to let you know about other roles that could be of interest to you.
If you’d prefer Macquarie not to retain your information on file for these purposes, please get in touch to let us know.
If you decide to apply for another role while your information is on file, the
storage
period will re-start from the date of your most recent application to Macquarie. When the relevant storage period comes to an end, Macquarie will make best efforts to delete, anonymise or put your information ‘beyond use’ within three months. If your application is successful, Macquarie will retain your information as part of your employment records.
If you’ve subscribed to updates on roles, events or Macquarie content but haven’t applied for a role, then your information will be retained for two years; you will have the opportunity to opt out
from receiving updates
at any time. We’ll check in with you before that two-year period expires to see if you’d like to continue to receive updates. If we don’t hear from you, we’ll assume you’re no longer interested in receiving updates and will make best efforts to delete, anonymise or put your information ‘beyond use’ within three months.
If you are unsuccessful in applying for a role with Macquarie while you’re subscribed to updates, we will retain your information based on whichever retention period expires last out of the relevant retention period for an unsuccessful applicant and the relevant retention period for a subscriber.
If you secure employment with Macquarie while you’re subscribed to updates, Macquarie will retain your information as part of your employment
records and you’ll continue to receive updates until you opt-out.
Your data, your choice
If, for any reason, you’re not comfortable with your information being used, collected, stored or disclosed in the ways described in this policy, please do not provide your information to Macquarie - you are not required by law to submit your information. Please note, however, that Macquarie may not be able to accept or process your application or requests if the necessary information is not supplied.
You may request access to your information (and the correction of incorrect information) at any time by contacting Macquarie at
privacy@macquarie.com
. If you are in the European Economic Area or the UK, you may also request that your information be transferred to another controller. Macquarie will address any such requests in accordance with any relevant obligations set out in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
If you are concerned about the way in which Macquarie has processed or used your personal information, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner or other applicable regulatory authority in your location, if available.

The Macquarie Group Privacy Policy sets out why we need to collect personal information, how we collect it, what we do with it, how it is stored and who we might share it with. The Policy also describes how you can access or correct information we hold about you, how you can ask further questions or make a complaint, and information about our websites and online activities.
The information we collect
For most products and services, it is necessary for us to collect 'personal information' such as your name, identity details, photos, contact details and transaction information. We may also need to collect other personal details (such as gender, marital status and financial information) and other information from which you can be identified.

for more information.
Credit Applications
Our
Credit Information Policy
sets out details of our collection and other handling of personal credit information, including collection of credit information from credit reporting bodies as well as our disclosure of credit information to credit reporting bodies. This applies mostly to our Australian credit products such as credit cards and loans.
Your information
Health Information
We collect your health information where we offer you products with an insurance component or in assessing certain claims, including hardship. We do not use or share that information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of your policy, claim or account, or as otherwise notified to you at the time we collect your information.
Sensitive Information
Generally, we do not collect sensitive information about you unless required or permitted by law or where you consent for us to do so. Sensitive information will only be collected if it is relevant to your product or the service or function you are engaging us to provide. If applicable, this will be communicated to you. For example, some forms of biometric data are collected, stored, and used to support access and verification procedures as well as fraud prevention.
We will not collect sensitive information about you where this is expressly prohibited by local law.
Sensitive information includes information relating to:
race
political or religious beliefs
sexual orientation and sexual life
criminal convictions
membership of professional or trade associations or unions
biometric and health information
information about your affiliation with certain organisations, such as professional associations.
Why we collect personal information
We collect personal information about you which is reasonably necessary to:
provide you with quality products, services or transaction opportunities. This may include consumer facing services conducted by Macquarie Bank Limited and/or its related entities (such as consumer banking, insurance or wealth advisory services) or services, advice or investment activity provided and/or undertaken by entities involved in the various corporate advisory and investment activities undertaken by Macquarie Group Limited and its related entities
consider applications and approaches you make to us
conduct marketing and social functions
maintain your contact details
fulfil our legal obligations, such as those relating to taxation, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, comprehensive consumer credit reporting under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, to prevent fraud, or as otherwise authorised by you.
Without such information, we may not be able to process your application or provide you with an appropriate level of service.  In such circumstances, we will process your application to the extent possible, and provide you with the most appropriate level of service that we can.
How we collect your information
We collect personal information about you directly from you — this can be in person, in documents you give us, from telephone calls, emails, competitions you enter, your access to our website or from transactions you make including via mobile banking. We take reasonable steps to be transparent about how and why we collect personal data.
We may also collect your personal information from joint account holder(s) or third parties including public sources, your adviser(s), employer (or its affiliates), agents, introducers, referrers, brokers, our related companies and service providers (including credit reporting bodies, fraud and financial crime information exchanges and other information service providers).
How we store your information
We keep personal information in physical and electronic records, at our premises and the premises of our service providers, which may include processing or storage in the cloud, which may mean in practice that this information is stored outside the country in which it is collected. Where this occurs, we take steps to protect the security and integrity of personal information.
We also keep records of our interactions with you (including by telephone, email and online) and of your transaction history.
How we use your information
We use personal information about you for the purpose for which it was provided to us, including to:
process applications
administer and manage our products and services (including monitoring, auditing, and evaluating those products and services)
model and test data (in a controlled environment)
develop scores, risk assessments and related analytical tools
communicate with you and deal with or investigate any complaints or enquiries.
We may also:
anonymise your data for our own purposes including market research and new product development
use personal information about you for the prevention and mitigation of fraud and other financial crimes
use or permit our affiliates to use your personal information for related purposes to the extent that it is lawful to do so without your express permission. For example, we may from time to time use your personal information to inform you or your employer of investment opportunities or to provide information about products and services which we expect may be of interest to you. However, if you don't want to receive such communications you can tell us by using any of the methods listed below.
While we may sometimes - where it is lawful and with your permission if necessary - share personal information with companies we do business with (e.g., in product development, joint venture arrangements or distribution arrangements), we do not sell personal information for marketing purposes to other organisations or allow such companies to do this.
When your information is disclosed
Subject in all cases to local law, we may share personal information within the Macquarie Group, and may disclose personal information outside the Macquarie Group:
to our service providers, who provide services in connection with our products and services (including archival, auditing, accounting, customer contact, legal, business consulting, banking, payment, delivery, data processing, data analysis, information broking, mailing, marketing, research, investigation, insurance, identity verification, brokerage, maintenance, trustee, securitisation, website and technology services)
to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations imposed by regulators including those under anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws or laws relating to comprehensive consumer credit reporting, or reasonably arising in connection with legal proceedings.
to our affiliates
to your nominated financial adviser with your permission
for the prevention and mitigation of fraud and other financial crimes
as contained in the terms and conditions of any specific product or service.
We may also disclose your personal information (on a confidential basis) in connection with our operating business and principal investment activities including, but not limited to:
mergers and acquisitions,
the management of any parts of our business assets (including divestments and reorganisation)
the provision of any debt to another party.
In some circumstances the parties to whom we disclose personal information may operate outside of Australia or, in the case of data collected within the United Kingdom or European Union, outside the United Kingdom and European Union — this includes locations in the countries listed in the Appendix. Where this occurs, we take steps to protect personal information against misuse or loss and to comply with local law in respect of the transfer of your data from one jurisdiction to another. Those parties, in turn, may make such information available to the governments of such other countries in accordance with local law requirements.
Keeping information accurate and up to date
We take reasonable steps to ensure that all information we hold is as accurate as possible. You are able to contact us at any time and ask for its correction if you feel the information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete.
Keeping information secure
We use security procedures and technology to protect the information we hold. Access to and use of personal information within Macquarie Group seeks to prevent misuse or unlawful disclosure of the information — this includes internal policies, auditing, training and monitoring of staff.
If other organisations provide support services, we require them to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure the privacy of the information provided to them.
How you can access or correct your information
You can contact us to request access to or correction of your personal information. In normal circumstances we will give you full access or make the requested corrections to your information. However, there may be some legal or administrative reasons to deny these requests. If your request is denied, we will provide you with the reason why (if we can). Where we decide not to make a requested correction to your personal information and you disagree, you may ask us to make a note of your requested correction with the information.
