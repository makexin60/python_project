Privacy Policy
Effective Date:
August 20, 2024
Introduction
Welcome to Adslocker! This Privacy Policy outlines how Adslocker, created by Martalia LLC (hereinafter referred to as the "Provider"), processes your data when you use our services. We recommend that you read this document carefully to understand how we manage your information and how we use it. This document provides an overview of our commitments to privacy and the responsible use of your data while using the Adslocker application.
Acceptance of Privacy Policy
By using the application, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any provisions, please refrain from using the application.
Data Protection
Our priority is the security of our clients' data. We collect only the data necessary to provide the service. The conditions mentioned in this Policy are defined in the Terms of Use. By accessing the application or providing us with your data, you agree to our Privacy Policy and enter into an agreement with Martalia LLC, registered in Georgia and operating under the brand Adslocker. The data controller is Martalia LLC (contact email: support@martalia-llc.com). If you have questions about this Policy, please contact us.
Data Processing
To ensure the smooth operation of the application and provide services, data processing is conducted solely for these purposes. This process may be manual or automated and is performed by both Adslocker and its affiliates and partners. We also collaborate with external services for marketing campaigns, basic analytics, and ad display. As part of our strict no-logs policy, no user activity within the app is tracked or recorded, ensuring complete confidentiality of your interaction with the service.
Information We Collect
The application collects data about your device when it is used. This information may include IP address, visited pages, visit times, session duration, and operating system. We do not collect data about your precise location.
Data Processing and User Rights
We collect and process your data to provide the best service according to our agreement described in the Terms of Use. Your data is protected in accordance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws. We do not store traffic logs or browsing history, making it impossible to link activity to specific users. In case of legal requests, we provide only limited data that we possess. You have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue using our services by contacting us at: support@martalia-llc.com.
Use of Data
Adslocker does not collect or store personal data that identifies users. We only process information about application crashes to help improve the app.
Personalized Advertising
To display ads tailored to user interests, we may work with external partners using cookies and pixel tags. Such ads may be shown both on our own platforms and on third-party websites. It is important to note that opting out of personalized advertising does not completely remove ads—you will still see ads, but they will be less relevant to your preferences. Detailed information about these methods and how to opt out can be found on the National Advertising Initiative website. Our primary advertising partner is Admob, which provides ad display (Admob Privacy Policy).
Privacy and Security
Adslocker processes only information about app crashes to improve app performance, with user data remaining fully protected and confidential. We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data that could identify a user. Your data is protected through physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. Our commitment to user data security allows us to provide reliable protection for the processed information.
Interactions with Third Parties
Aggregated and anonymized data may be shared with third-party services to assist in optimizing the app’s performance and quality of services. The service provider may exchange such information with external organizations according to the terms of our privacy policy.
Age Restrictions
Individuals under 18 years of age are not permitted to use the Adslocker application or provide personal data without adult supervision. We assume all users are at least 18 years old. If we discover that a minor is using the application, their access will be immediately blocked.
Children’s Privacy Policy
We recognize the importance of protecting children’s data and do not knowingly collect information from individuals under 18 years of age. If we discover that data has been collected from a child under 18, it will be immediately removed from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and have learned that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at: support@martalia-llc.com so we can take the necessary measures.
Changes and Updates to the Policy
We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Any updates will be posted on this page. We recommend regularly reviewing this Policy for changes, as continued use of the application signifies your agreement with the updates. You may not transfer your rights under this policy to third parties.
