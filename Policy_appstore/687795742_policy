3. In-App Advertising and Third-Party Services

Some of my apps may display third-party ads. These ads are served by third-party providers, which may collect anonymized data to show relevant ads. I do not control the data these providers collect or their practices.
Third-Party Links:
The Apps may contain links to external websites or services not controlled by me. I'm not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites, and I encourage you to review their privacy policies.
4. Sharing Your Information
Your information won't be sold, rented, or shared with third parties except as follows:

I may engage trusted third parties to perform functions necessary to support the Apps, such as hosting or customer support. These providers have access only to information required to perform their functions.
Legal Requirements:
Your information may be disclosed if required by law, in response to a court order, or to protect my rights, property, or safety or that of others.
5. Data Security
I implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.
6. Your Rights and Choices
Access and Update Information:
You may review, update, or delete your account information directly within the Apps, where applicable.
Opt-Out of Advertising:
You may adjust your device settings or limit ad tracking to reduce ad personalization. Note that some non-personalized ads may still be displayed.

If you wish to delete your account, you may do so within the Apps. Once deleted, your data may be retained as necessary to comply with legal obligations.
7. Children's Privacy
The Apps are not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If I become aware of any such data being collected, I'll take steps to delete it promptly.
