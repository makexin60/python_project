Cookies are small text files, which are stored on your end device (e.g. laptop, smartphone). Most of the cookies that we use will be deleted from your hard drive once your browsing session comes to an end (also known as ‘session cookies’). Other cookies remain on your computer and they allow us to recognise your computer when you next visit our website (also known as ‘durable cookies’). These cookies serve as a welcome for your user name. You will be asked to enter your password again, or fill out forms that require your data. Our partner companies are not allowed to collect, process or use your personal data via cookies.
We use cookies on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) DSGVO (legitimate interest in optimising our services). Certain cookies are used exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 a) DSGVO). We generally divide cookies into three categories according to their purpose:
Necessary cookies
These cookies are necessary for the function of our services. This applies, for example, to cookies that shop login data after registration in our online shop, so that the user remains logged in to our online shop even after switching to another page, or for cookies that ensure that a user-related configuration of the service functions (selected language, etc.) is maintained across sessions. Furthermore, these cookies contribute to a safe and proper use of our services. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO.
Analytical and functional cookies
These cookies enable us to provide advanced functionalities and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third parties whose services we use in our Services. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these services may not work properly. These cookies also allow us to count visits and traffic sources so that we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us answer questions about which pages are most popular, which are least used and how visitors move around our services. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not be able to know when you have used/visited our services. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO, insofar as you have given us your consent."
Marketing Cookies
These cookies can be set by us or our partners via our website in order to show you relevant content/advertising both on our website and on third-party websites. In doing so, so-called profiles can be formed on the basis of your interests. A direct identification of a person is usually not possible through this information, as only pseudonymous browser and/or device information is used. If you do not allow these cookies or similar technologies, you will experience less relevant content/advertising tailored to your interests. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6 (1) (a) DSGVO, insofar as you have given us your consent.
Insofar as we use your information on the basis of your consent, you grant this consent by clicking on the "Ok" button on the banner displayed during your visit when you visit our services - if necessary after you have made certain settings:
By clicking "Ok", you consent to the use of cookies to process your data, including the transfer to our marketing partners (third parties). Our partners also use cookies and other technologies for personalisation, measurement and analysis of advertising.
Right of withdrawal notice
You can revoke your consent in whole or in part at any time with effect for the future by changing your settings in our preference centre

Furthermore, cookies from Google Inc. are also stored, which collect and store information about the surfing behaviour of website visitors in anonymised form for marketing purposes. This enables targeted product recommendations to be displayed in the form of advertising banners or advertisements on third-party websites (so-called publishers). This data cannot be used to personally identify visitors to the website. The collected data will only be used for the purpose of designing or improving the offer in line with requirements. It will not be used in any other way or passed on to third parties. You can object to this anonymous analysis of your surfing behaviour at any time by calling up the

Use of Google Analytics
If you give us your consent, we will use the Google Analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited ("Google"). We comply with the current
Google Analytics Terms of Use
and the
Google Ads Data Processing Terms
and, if your personal data is processed in an insecure third country, we have signed the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Google LLC in accordance with Art. 46 paragraph 2 lit. c) DSGVO,
Information here.
According to Section 10.3
Google Ads Data Processing Terms
the information you provide will be stored at the following locations (so-called „data center locations“):
www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/
.
For this reason, we will only use Google Analytics if you also consent to the transfer to the data centers listed above. In some cases, the third countries in which the data centers are located or from which processing is carried out do not provide an adequate level of data protection, based on a decision by the European Commission (see a list of so-called safe third countries here:
ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_de
). For example, the USA is currently not considered a safe third country. The transfer to unsafe third countries is associated with risks for your personal data, especially since access by the US authorities cannot be ruled out in the event of a transfer to the USA. These risks cannot be excluded solely by the conclusion of standard contractual clauses between solebox and the processor or controller in the third country. Nevertheless, the Google Ads Data Processing Terms (see
privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/
in the section "Appendix 2") contain a variety of technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information.
Please consider these factors when giving your consent.
You can find general information about Google's processing of your personal data here:
policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de
.
If you have consented to its use, we use the web analytics service Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects pseudonymous information about your use of our website, including your shortened IP address and the use of cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your shortened IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the countries listed above. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also combine this information with other data about you, such as your search history, your personal account, usage data from other devices and other data that Google has stored about you. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law (e.g. government authorities) or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
The data stored by Google Analytics is kept for 14 months. After this period, Google Analytics will only store aggregated statistics. The use of Google Analytics is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO).
You can withdraw your consent in accordance with the information in Section 10.

This contract provides for appropriate safeguards for the protection of your data with service providers in the third country.
