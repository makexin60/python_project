Cookies are small text files, which are stored on your end device (e.g. laptop, smartphone). Most of the cookies that we use will be deleted from your hard drive once your browsing session comes to an end (also known as ‘session cookies’). Other cookies remain on your computer and they allow us to recognise your computer when you next visit our website (also known as ‘durable cookies’). These cookies serve as a welcome for your user name. You will be asked to enter your password again, or fill out forms that require your data. Our partner companies are not allowed to collect, process or use your personal data via cookies.
We use cookies on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) DSGVO (legitimate interest in optimising our services). Certain cookies are used exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 a) DSGVO). We generally divide cookies into three categories according to their purpose:
Necessary cookies
These cookies are necessary for the function of our services. This applies, for example, to cookies that shop login data after registration in our online shop, so that the user remains logged in to our online shop even after switching to another page, or for cookies that ensure that a user-related configuration of the service functions (selected language, etc.) is maintained across sessions. Furthermore, these cookies contribute to a safe and proper use of our services. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO.
Analytical and functional cookies
These cookies enable us to provide advanced functionalities and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third parties whose services we use in our Services. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these services may not work properly. These cookies also allow us to count visits and traffic sources so that we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us answer questions about which pages are most popular, which are least used and how visitors move around our services. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not be able to know when you have used/visited our services. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO, insofar as you have given us your consent."
Marketing Cookies
These cookies can be set by us or our partners via our website in order to show you relevant content/advertising both on our website and on third-party websites. In doing so, so-called profiles can be formed on the basis of your interests. A direct identification of a person is usually not possible through this information, as only pseudonymous browser and/or device information is used. If you do not allow these cookies or similar technologies, you will experience less relevant content/advertising tailored to your interests. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6 (1) (a) DSGVO, insofar as you have given us your consent.
Insofar as we use your information on the basis of your consent, you grant this consent by clicking on the "Ok" button on the banner displayed during your visit when you visit our services - if necessary after you have made certain settings:
By clicking "Ok", you consent to the use of cookies to process your data, including the transfer to our marketing partners (third parties). Our partners also use cookies and other technologies for personalisation, measurement and analysis of advertising.
Right of withdrawal notice
You can revoke your consent in whole or in part at any time with effect for the future by changing your settings in our preference centre

Furthermore, cookies from Google Inc. are also stored, which collect and store information about the surfing behaviour of website visitors in anonymised form for marketing purposes. This enables targeted product recommendations to be displayed in the form of advertising banners or advertisements on third-party websites (so-called publishers). This data cannot be used to personally identify visitors to the website. The collected data will only be used for the purpose of designing or improving the offer in line with requirements. It will not be used in any other way or passed on to third parties. You can object to this anonymous analysis of your surfing behaviour at any time by calling up the

Use of Google Analytics
If you give us your consent, we will use the Google Analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited ("Google"). We comply with the current
Google Analytics Terms of Use
and the
Google Ads Data Processing Terms
and, if your personal data is processed in an insecure third country, we have signed the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Google LLC in accordance with Art. 46 paragraph 2 lit. c) DSGVO,
Information here.
According to Section 10.3
Google Ads Data Processing Terms
the information you provide will be stored at the following locations (so-called „data center locations“):
www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/
.
For this reason, we will only use Google Analytics if you also consent to the transfer to the data centers listed above. In some cases, the third countries in which the data centers are located or from which processing is carried out do not provide an adequate level of data protection, based on a decision by the European Commission (see a list of so-called safe third countries here:
ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_de
). For example, the USA is currently not considered a safe third country. The transfer to unsafe third countries is associated with risks for your personal data, especially since access by the US authorities cannot be ruled out in the event of a transfer to the USA. These risks cannot be excluded solely by the conclusion of standard contractual clauses between solebox and the processor or controller in the third country. Nevertheless, the Google Ads Data Processing Terms (see
privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/
in the section "Appendix 2") contain a variety of technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information.
Please consider these factors when giving your consent.
You can find general information about Google's processing of your personal data here:
policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de
.
If you have consented to its use, we use the web analytics service Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects pseudonymous information about your use of our website, including your shortened IP address and the use of cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your shortened IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the countries listed above. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also combine this information with other data about you, such as your search history, your personal account, usage data from other devices and other data that Google has stored about you. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law (e.g. government authorities) or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
The data stored by Google Analytics is kept for 14 months. After this period, Google Analytics will only store aggregated statistics. The use of Google Analytics is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO).
You can withdraw your consent in accordance with the information in Section 10.

The encryption of the user data is done with SSL certificates (class 2) 256 bit encryption with 2048 bit maximum key length. You can recognize SSL-protected areas by the lock symbol in your browser. Secured connections are usually recognizable by your address starting with "https://". If you double-click on the lock symbol, you will receive more detailed information about the security certificate. Your personal data is transferred securely through this encryption. This applies to your order and also to the customer login. Nobody can guarantee absolute protection. However, we secure our website and other systems through technical and organizational measures against loss, destruction, access, modification or distribution of your data by unauthorized persons.

Our partner companies are not allowed to collect, process or use your personal data via cookies.
We use cookies on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) DSGVO (legitimate interest in optimising our services). Certain cookies are used exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 a) DSGVO). We generally divide cookies into three categories according to their purpose:
Necessary cookies
These cookies are necessary for the function of our services. This applies, for example, to cookies that shop login data after registration in our online shop, so that the user remains logged in to our online shop even after switching to another page, or for cookies that ensure that a user-related configuration of the service functions (selected language, etc.) is maintained across sessions. Furthermore, these cookies contribute to a safe and proper use of our services. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO.
Analytical and functional cookies
These cookies enable us to provide advanced functionalities and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third parties whose services we use in our Services. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these services may not work properly. These cookies also allow us to count visits and traffic sources so that we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us answer questions about which pages are most popular, which are least used and how visitors move around our services. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not be able to know when you have used/visited our services. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO, insofar as you have given us your consent."
Marketing Cookies
These cookies can be set by us or our partners via our website in order to show you relevant content/advertising both on our website and on third-party websites. In doing so, so-called profiles can be formed on the basis of your interests. A direct identification of a person is usually not possible through this information, as only pseudonymous browser and/or device information is used. If you do not allow these cookies or similar technologies, you will experience less relevant content/advertising tailored to your interests. The legal basis for the use of these technologies is Article 6 (1) (a) DSGVO, insofar as you have given us your consent.
Insofar as we use your information on the basis of your consent, you grant this consent by clicking on the "Ok" button on the banner displayed during your visit when you visit our services - if necessary after you have made certain settings:
By clicking "Ok", you consent to the use of cookies to process your data, including the transfer to our marketing partners (third parties). Our partners also use cookies and other technologies for personalisation, measurement and analysis of advertising.
Right of withdrawal notice
You can revoke your consent in whole or in part at any time with effect for the future by changing your settings in our preference centre

Furthermore, cookies from Google Inc. are also stored, which collect and store information about the surfing behaviour of website visitors in anonymised form for marketing purposes. This enables targeted product recommendations to be displayed in the form of advertising banners or advertisements on third-party websites (so-called publishers). This data cannot be used to personally identify visitors to the website. The collected data will only be used for the purpose of designing or improving the offer in line with requirements. It will not be used in any other way or passed on to third parties. You can object to this anonymous analysis of your surfing behaviour at any time by calling up the

Use of Google Analytics
If you give us your consent, we will use the Google Analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited ("Google"). We comply with the current
Google Analytics Terms of Use
and the
Google Ads Data Processing Terms
and, if your personal data is processed in an insecure third country, we have signed the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Google LLC in accordance with Art. 46 paragraph 2 lit. c) DSGVO,
Information here.
According to Section 10.3
Google Ads Data Processing Terms
the information you provide will be stored at the following locations (so-called „data center locations“):
www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/
.
For this reason, we will only use Google Analytics if you also consent to the transfer to the data centers listed above. In some cases, the third countries in which the data centers are located or from which processing is carried out do not provide an adequate level of data protection, based on a decision by the European Commission (see a list of so-called safe third countries here:
ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_de
). For example, the USA is currently not considered a safe third country. The transfer to unsafe third countries is associated with risks for your personal data, especially since access by the US authorities cannot be ruled out in the event of a transfer to the USA. These risks cannot be excluded solely by the conclusion of standard contractual clauses between solebox and the processor or controller in the third country. Nevertheless, the Google Ads Data Processing Terms (see
privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/
in the section "Appendix 2") contain a variety of technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information.
Please consider these factors when giving your consent.
You can find general information about Google's processing of your personal data here:
policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de

If you have consented to its use, we use the web analytics service Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects pseudonymous information about your use of our website, including your shortened IP address and the use of cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your shortened IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the countries listed above. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also combine this information with other data about you, such as your search history, your personal account, usage data from other devices and other data that Google has stored about you. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law (e.g. government authorities) or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
The data stored by Google Analytics is kept for 14 months. After this period, Google Analytics will only store aggregated statistics. The use of Google Analytics is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO).
You can withdraw your consent in accordance with the information in Section 10.

1.
Data Centre & Network Security
(a)
Data Centres
.
Infrastructure
. Google maintains geographically distributed data centres. Google stores all production data in physically secure data centres.
Redundancy
. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimise the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The Processor Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer's or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data centre equipment is scheduled through a standard process according to documented procedures.
Power
. The data centre electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data centre. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the data centre, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the backup generator systems take over. The backup generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data centre at full capacity typically for a period of days.
Server Operating Systems
. Google servers use hardened operating systems which are customised for the unique server needs of the business. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to increase the security of the code used to provide the Processor Services and enhance the security products in production environments.
Business Continuity
. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.
Encryption Technologies
. Google’s security policies mandate encryption at rest for all user data, including personal data. Data is often encrypted at multiple levels in Google’s production storage stack in data centres, including at the hardware level, without requiring any action by customers. Using multiple layers of encryption adds redundant data protection and allows Google to select the optimal approach based on application requirements. All personal data is encrypted at the storage level, generally using AES256. Google uses common cryptographic libraries which incorporate Google’s FIPS 140-2 validated module, to implement encryption consistently across the Processor Services.
(b)
Networks & Transmission
.
Data Transmission
. Data centres are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centres. Further, Google encrypts data transmitted between data centres. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during electronic transport. Google transfers data via Internet standard protocols.
External Attack Surface
. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.
Intrusion Detection
. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google’s intrusion detection involves:
1.
Tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;
2.
Employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and
3.
Employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.
Incident Response
. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.
Encryption Technologies
. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as TLS connection) available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods help protect traffic and minimise the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.
2.
Access and Site Controls
(a)
Site Controls
.
On-site Data Centre Security Operation
. Google’s data centres maintain an on-site security operation responsible for all physical data centre security functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operations personnel monitor Closed Circuit TV (“
CCTV
”) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform internal and external patrols of the data centre regularly.
Data Centre Access Procedures
. Google maintains formal access procedures for allowing physical access to the data centres. The data centres are housed in facilities that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site security operation. All entrants to the data centre are required to identify themselves as well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorised employees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centres. Only authorised employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these facilities. Data centre electronic card key access requests must be made in advance and in writing, and require the approval of authorised data centre personnel. All other entrants requiring temporary data centre access must: (i) obtain approval in advance from authorised data centre personnel for the specific data centre and internal areas they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an approved data centre access record identifying the individual as approved.
On-site Data Centre Security Devices
. Google’s data centres employ an electronic card key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas. Unauthorised activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorised access throughout the business operations and data centres is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centres are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centres. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data centre building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables throughout the data centres connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on-site via digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are retained for at least 7 days based on activity.
(b)
Access Control
.
Infrastructure Security Personnel
. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Processor Services, and responding to security incidents.
Access Control and Privilege Management
. Customer's administrators and users must authenticate themselves via a central authentication system or via a single sign on system in order to use the Processor Services.
Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy
. Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorised persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorised persons to access data they are authorised to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralised access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilising digital certificates are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimise the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g. login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.
3.
Data
(a)
Data Storage, Isolation & Authentication
.
Google stores data in a multi-tenant environment on Google-owned servers. Data, the Processor Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centres. Google logically isolates each customer's data. A central authentication system is used across all Processor Services to increase uniform security of data.
(b)
Decommissioned Disks and Disk Destruction Guidelines
.
Certain disks containing data may experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be decommissioned (“
Decommissioned Disk
”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data destruction processes (the “
Data Destruction Guidelines
”) before leaving Google’s premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance with the Data Destruction Guidelines.
(c)
Pseudonymous Data
.
Online advertising data are commonly associated with online identifiers which on their own are considered ’pseudonymous’ (i.e. they cannot be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information). Google has a robust set of policies and technical and organisational controls in place to ensure the separation between pseudonymous data and personally identifiable user information (i.e. information that could be used on its own to directly identify, contact, or precisely locate an individual), such as a user’s Google account data. Google policies only allow for information flows between pseudonymous and personally identifiable data in strictly limited circumstances.
(d)
Launch reviews
.
Google conducts launch reviews for new products and features prior to launch. This includes a privacy review conducted by specially trained privacy engineers. In privacy reviews, privacy engineers ensure that all applicable Google policies and guidelines are followed, including but not limited to policies relating to pseudonymisation and data retention and deletion.
4.
Personnel Security
Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate background checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations.
Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training. Personnel handling Customer Personal Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role. Google’s personnel will not process Customer Personal Data without authorisation.
5.
Subprocessor Security
Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor, the Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms, subject to the requirements set out in Section 11.3 (Requirements for Subprocessor Engagement).

                    any other country, and European Data Protection Legislation applies to the transfers (“
Restricted
                      European Transfers
”), then:
(a)
if Google has adopted an Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European
                      Transfers, then Google will inform Customer of the relevant solution and ensure that such Restricted
                      European Transfers are made in accordance with that solution; and/or
(b)
if Google has not adopted, or informs Customer that Google is no longer adopting an
                      Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European Transfers, then:
(i)
if Google’s address is in an Adequate Country:
(A)
the SCCs (Processor-to-Processor, Google Exporter) will apply with respect to such
                          Restricted European Transfers from Google to Subprocessors; and
(B)
in addition, if Customer’s address is not in an Adequate Country, the SCCs
                          (Processor-to-Controller) will apply with respect to Restricted European Transfers between Google
                          and Customer (regardless of whether Customer is a controller and/or a processor); or
(ii)
if Google’s address is not in an Adequate Country, the SCCs (Controller-to-Processor)
                        and/or SCCs (Processor-to-Processor) will apply (according to whether Customer is a controller and/or
                        processor) with respect to such Restricted European Transfers between Customer and Google.
7.2
Supplementary Measures and Information
. Google will provide Customer with
                    information relevant to Restricted European Transfers, including information about supplementary measures to
                    protect Customer Personal Data, as described in Section 7.5 (Verifying Compliance), Appendix 2 (Security
                    Measures) and other materials concerning the nature of the Processor Services and the processing of Customer
                    Personal Data (for example, help centre articles).
7.3
Termination
. If Customer concludes, based on its current or intended use of
                    the Processor Services, that the Alternative Transfer Solution and/or SCCs, as applicable, do not provide
                    appropriate safeguards for Customer Personal Data, then Customer may immediately terminate the Agreement for
                    convenience by notifying Google in writing.
7.4
Alternative Transfer Solution Adoption and Certification
. Information about
                    Google and/or its Affiliates’ adoption of, or certification under, any Alternative Transfer Solutions can be
                    found at
https://business.safety.google/adsdatatransfers
.
8.
Subprocessors
. When engaging any Subprocessor, Google will ensure via a written contract that if
                  the processing of Customer Personal Data is subject to European Data Protection Legislation, the data protection
                  obligations in these Data Processing Terms (as referred to in Article 28(3) of the GDPR, if applicable) are
                  imposed on the Subprocessor.

(a)
collect and maintain records of certain information, including: (i) the name and contact
                    details of each processor and/or controller on behalf of which Google is acting and (if applicable) of such
                    processor’s or controller's local representative and data protection officer, and (ii) if applicable under
                    the Customer SCCs, Customer’s Supervisory Authority; and
(b)
make such information available to any Supervisory Authority. Accordingly, Customer will,
                    where requested and as applicable to Customer, provide such information to Google via the user interface of
                    the Processor Services or via such other means as may be provided by Google, and will use such user
                    interface or other means to ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.
10.
SCCs
10.1
Order of Precedence
. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the
                    Customer SCCs and this Appendix 3A, the remainder of these Data Processing Terms or the remainder of the
                    Agreement, then the Customer SCCs will prevail.
10.2
No Modification of SCCs
. Nothing in the Agreement (including these Data
                    Processing Terms) is intended to modify or contradict any SCCs or prejudice the fundamental rights or
                    freedoms of data subjects under the European Data Protection Legislation.
11.

Applicable State Privacy Law Terms (under Restricted Data Processing).
3.1
With respect to Customer Personal Data processed under Restricted Data Processing, and to the extent that one or
                    more of the US State Privacy Laws applies to the processing of Customer Personal Data:
3.1.1
Roles and Regulatory Compliance; Authorization.
(a)
Processor and Controller Responsibilities.
The parties acknowledge
                        and agree that:
(i)
Appendix 1 of these Data Processing Terms describes the subject matter and details of the processing of Customer Personal Data, subject to the following modifications:

Additional Product
”), the RDP Services may allow that Additional Product to access Customer Personal Data as required for the interoperation of the Additional Product with the RDP Services. For clarity, this Appendix 3B does not apply to the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of any Additional Product used by Customer, including personal data transmitted to or from that Additional Product.
3.2
Data Security
3.2.1
Customer’s Security Responsibilities and Assessment.
(a)
Customer’s Security Responsibilities.
In addition to Customer’s security
                        responsibilities under Section 7.3.1 of these Data Processing Terms, Customer agrees that, without prejudice
                        to Google’s obligations under Sections 7.1 (Google’s Security Measures and Assistance) and 7.2 (Data
                        Incidents) of these Data Processing Terms, Customer is responsible for its use of the RDP Services,
                        including: (1) making appropriate use of the RDP Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the
                        risk in respect of Customer Personal Data; and (2) securing the account authentication credentials, systems
                        and devices Customer uses to access the RDP Services.
(b)
Customer’s Audit Rights.
(i)
Customer may conduct an audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under
                          this Appendix 3B by requesting and reviewing (1) a certificate issued for security verification
                          reflecting the outcome of an audit conducted by a third party auditor (e.g., SOC 2 Type II or ISO/IEC
                          27001 certification or a comparable certification or other security certification of an audit conducted
                          by a third-party auditor agreed by Customer and Google) within 12 months as of the date of Customer’s
                          request and (2) any other information Google determines is reasonably necessary for Customer to verify
                          such compliance.
(ii)
Alternatively, Google may, at its sole discretion and in response to a request by
                          Customer, initiate a third-party audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under this
                          Appendix 3B. During such an audit, Google will make available to the third-party auditor all information
                          necessary to demonstrate such compliance. Where Customer requests such an audit, Google may charge a fee
                          (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit. Google will provide Customer with further details of
                          any applicable fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of any such audit. Customer will be
                          responsible for any fees charged by any third-party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such
                          audit.
(iii)
Nothing in this Appendix 3B will require Google either to disclose to Customer or its
                          third-party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third-party auditor to access:
(1)
any data of any other customer of a Google Entity;
(2)
any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
(3)
any trade secret of a Google Entity;
(4)
any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the
                            security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to breach its
                            obligations under the US State Privacy Laws or its security and/or privacy obligations to Customer
                            or any third party; or
(5)
any information that Customer or its third party auditor seeks to access for any
                            reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer’s obligations under the US State Privacy
                            Laws.
3.3
Data Subject Rights.
For the purposes of this Appendix 3B, Google will adhere to
                    the procedures set forth under Section 9 (Data Subject Requests) to the extent such requests, requests for
                    assistance, or rectification is applicable to the RDP Services.
3.4
Subcontractors.
(a)
Customer generally authorizes Google to engage other entities as subcontractors in
                      connection with the provision of the RDP Services. When engaging any subcontractor, Google will:
(i)
ensure via a written contract that: (A) the subcontractor only accesses and uses
                        Customer Personal Data to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and does
                        so in accordance with the Agreement (including this Appendix 3B); and (B) if the processing of Customer
                        Personal Data is subject to the US State Privacy Laws, ensure that the data protection obligations in
                        this Appendix 3B are imposed on the subcontractor;
(ii)
when engaging any new subcontractors, provide notice of such new subcontractors where
                        required by US State Privacy Laws, and, where required by US State Privacy Laws, further provide an
                        opportunity for Customer to object to such subcontractors; and
(iii)
remain fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to, and all acts and omissions of,
                        the subcontractor.
(b)
Customer may object to any new subcontractor by terminating the Agreement for convenience
                      immediately upon written notice to Google, on condition that Customer provides such notice within 90 days of
                      being informed of the engagement of the new subcontractor as described in paragraph 3.4(a)(ii) herein.
4.

                      in supporting documentation available at
business.safety.google/rdp
, as updated from
                      time to time;

                      Customer Personal Data available to Google for such purposes;
(v)
Google will allow audits to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under this Appendix 3B in accordance with paragraph 3.2.1(b) (Customer’s Audit Rights) of this Appendix 3B;
(vi)
Google will notify Customer if Google makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligations under the CCPA. This paragraph 5.1(vi) does not reduce either party’s rights and obligations elsewhere in the Agreement;
(vii)
If Customer reasonably believes that Google is processing Customer Personal Data in an unauthorized manner, Customer has the right to notify Google of such belief via the methods described at
privacy.google.com/businesses/processorsupport
, and the parties will work together in good faith to remediate the allegedly violative processing activities, if necessary; and

                      level of privacy protection as is required by CCPA.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off.

The legal grounds for processing this information will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
To
perform a contract
with you, such as when you contact Google for support or sign up for communications about product updates.
When necessary for our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties, including to:
Provide, maintain, and improve services to meet the needs of our users.
For example, informing you about our services, such as to let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.
Marketing to inform users about our services.
For example, emailing users of Photos about a printing promotion.
To protect Google, our users, and the public
To help improve the safety and reliability of our services, including detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.
Examples of processing activities:
We collect and analyze IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
We analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
We process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
To meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Examples of processing activities:
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process.
Legal obligations sometimes require us to retain certain information for purposes like financial record-keeping, such as information about a payment you’ve made to Google for tax or accounting purposes.
Various laws and regulations require us to put in place measures to confirm that our users are old enough to use our services. To help determine your age, we process the date of birth you provide. We also process information about your activity in our services, both when you’re signed in to a Google Account or signed out, and use machine learning technology to determine if you are likely over 18. In certain cases, if we cannot confirm that you are old enough to use our services by other means, we can request other information to verify your age, like your government ID, credit card, a photo of you, or your phone number.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).
Google Dashboard
allows you to manage information associated with specific products.

payment information
).
Information that we collect as you use our services
:
Information about your apps, browsers & devices
, such as
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using; and information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, (like IP address, crash reports, and system activity).
Information about your activity in our services
, such as your search terms, Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account, your views and interactions with content and ads, and your activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services. You can review and control activity data stored in your Google Account in
My Activity
.
Location information
, such as may be determined by GPS, IP address, and other data from sensors on or around your device, depending in part on your device and account settings.
Information from publicly accessible sources
, such as information that’s publicly available online (like if your name appears in a local newspaper article) or from other public sources.
Information from our trusted partners
, such as from directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, or security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.
The legal grounds for processing this information will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
When necessary for our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties, including to:
Enforce legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service.
For example, analyzing content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services.
For example, collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public, including disclosing information to government authorities.
For example, responding to legal process or enforceable requests from governments and courts to disclose data, after carefully reviewing each request to make sure it satisfies applicable laws.

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more

Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more

You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more

For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

In the following you can read about your rights. If you want to know more or come in contact with us to exercise your rights, the easiest way is to email us on
privacy@klarna.co.uk
. If you want to receive information about the data Klarna holds about you through so-called subject access, or have certain data deleted, you can send a request to us by filling out this
form
, which is available on our homepage. For other types of questions please use the contact details in section 12.
Your rights
Right to have personal data deleted (“Right to be forgotten”).
In some cases, you have the right to have us delete personal data about you. For example you can request us to delete such personal data that we (i) no longer need for the purpose it was collected for, or (ii) that we process based on your consent and you revoke your consent. There are situations where Klarna is unable to delete your data, for example, when the data is still necessary to process for the purpose for which the data was collected, Klarna’s interest to process the data overrides your interest in having them deleted, or because we have a legal obligation to keep it. You can read more about our legal obligations to keep data in section 4 and 9 in this Privacy Notice. The laws described there prevent us from immediately deleting certain data. You also have the right to object to us using your personal data for certain purposes such as direct marketing, which you can read more about in this list of your rights.
Right to be informed.
You have the right to be informed of how we process your personal data. We do this through this privacy notice, by service-specific FAQs, and by answering your questions.
Right to receive access to your personal data (“Subject access”).
You have the right to know if Klarna processes personal data about you, and to receive a copy (“data extract”) of such data, so-called subject access. Through the data extract you will receive information about what personal data Klarna holds about you and how we process it.
Right to access, and request a transfer, of your personal data to another recipient (“Data portability”).
This right means that you can request a copy of the personal data relating to you that Klarna holds for the performance of a contract with you, or based on your consent, in a machine-readable format. This will allow you to use this data somewhere else, for example to transfer your personal data to another controller/recipient.
Right to rectification.
You have the right to request that we rectify inaccurate information or complete information about you that you consider is inaccurate or incomplete.
Right to restrict processing.
If you believe that your personal data is inaccurate, that our processing is unlawful or that we do not need the information for a specific purpose, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of such personal data. You also have the possibility to request that we stop processing your personal data while we assess your request. If you
object
to our processing per your right described directly below, you may also request us to restrict processing of that personal data while we make our assessment.
Right to object against our processing of your personal data.
You have the right to object to processing of your personal data which is based on our legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR), by referencing your personal circumstances. You can also always object to our use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. When you let us know that you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us, we will turn off marketing for you, and stop sending it to you.
Right to object to an automated decision that significantly affects you
. You have the right to object to an automated decision made by Klarna if the decision produces legal effects or significantly affects you in a similar way. See section 6 on how Klarna makes use of automated decisions.
Right to withdraw one’s consent.
As described in section 5 below, where we process your personal data based on your consent or explicit consent, you have the right to revoke that consent at any time. When you revoke your consent we will stop processing your data for such purposes.

6. Klarna’s profiling and automated decisions that significantly affect you.
6.1 Klarna’s profiling of you as a customer.
“Profiling” means an automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal matters, for example, by analysing or predicting your personal preferences, such as buying interests. At the same time, we compare your data with what our other customers, with similar use of our services, have preferred.
The purpose of Klarna’s profiling and the personal data types used for each occasion and for each profiling are described in detail in section 3 above. The profiling for these purposes does not have a significant impact on you as a customer.
We use profiling for the following purposes:
to deliver our customised services, which customise their content based on what we think is most interesting to you (this applies to the Klarna mobile application, its various functions, and the order different payment methods appear at Klarna’s checkout), and
to deliver customised marketing to you.
If you have any questions about how the profiling process works, please contact us. Contact information is available in section 12. You may object to our marketing profiling at any time by contacting us (and we will then cease profiling for marketing purposes). You may also end our profiling for our services by terminating the service.
6.2 Klarna’s automated decisions that significantly affect you.
Automated decisions with legal effect, or automated decisions that similarly significantly affect you, means that certain decisions in our services are completely automated, without our employees being involved. These decisions have a significant effect on you as a customer, comparable to legal effects. By making such decisions automatically, Klarna increases its objectivity and transparency in the decision to offer you these services. At the same time, you have the right to object to these decisions at all times. You can read about how to object to these decisions at the end of this section 6.2.
Automated decisions that significantly affect you also mean that profiling is performed based on your data before the decision is made. This profiling is made to assess your financial situation (before the decision to grant credit) or to identify whether your use of our services involves a risk of fraud or money laundering. We profile your user behaviour and financial standing and compare this data with behaviours and conditions that indicate different risk levels for us.
When does Klarna take automated decisions that significantly affect you?
We make this kind of automated decision when we:
decide to approve your application to use a credit service.
decide
not
to approve your application to use a credit service. These automated credit decisions are based on the data you provide to us, data from external sources such as credit bureaus and Klarna’s own internal information. In addition to information about you, Klarna’s credit model includes a large number of other factors, such as Klarna’s internal credit risk levels and our customers’ general repayment rates (based on, for example, the current product category).
decide whether you pose a risk of fraud, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates possible fraudulent conduct, that your behaviour is not consistent with previous use of our services, or that you have attempted to conceal your true identity. Automated decisions whereby we assess whether you constitute a fraud risk are based on information you have provided yourself, data from fraud prevention agencies (see section 7.2.3. for details of which ones we use), and Klarna’s own internal information.
decide whether there is a risk of money laundering, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates money laundering. In relevant cases, Klarna also investigates whether specific customers are listed on sanction lists.
The personal data types used in each decision are described in section 3. See section 7 for more information about whom we share information with as regards profiling during automated decisions.
If you are not approved under the automated decisions described above, you will not have access to Klarna’s services, such as our payment methods. Klarna has several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can contact us, and we will determine whether the procedure was performed appropriately. You can also object in accordance with the following instructions.
Your right to object to these automated decisions
You always have the right to object to an automated decision with legal consequences or decisions which can otherwise significantly affect you (together with the relevant profiling) by sending an e-mail message to
privacy@klarna.co.uk
. A Klarna employee will then review the decision, taking into account any additional information and circumstances that you provide to us.
7. Who do we share your personal data with?
When we share your personal data, we ensure that the recipient processes it in accordance with this notice, such as by entering into data transfer agreements or data processor agreements with the recipients. Those agreements include all reasonable contractual, legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure that your information is processed with an adequate level of protection and in accordance with applicable law.
7.1 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna will always share your personal information, regardless of the service you use.
7.1.1 Suppliers and subcontractors.
Description of the recipient
: Suppliers and subcontractors are companies that only have the right to process the personal data they receive from Klarna on behalf of Klarna, i.e. data processors. Examples of such suppliers and subcontractors are software and data storage providers, payment service providers and business consultants.
Purpose and legal basis
: Klarna needs access to services and functionality from other companies where it cannot perform them itself. Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to access these services and functionality (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See section 2 for more information about your rights.
7.1.2 Klarna Group.
Description of the recipient
: Companies in the Klarna Group.
Purpose and legal basis
: This is required for Klarna to be able to provide you with services and functionality. Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to access these services and functionality (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See section 2 for more information about your rights.
When you shop in a foreign store (meaning a store located outside of the EU/EEA area) that has an agreement with another company within the Klarna Group, the disclosure of your personal information between Klarna companies is required in order for the two Klarna companies to manage your payment and enable the foreign store to administer your purchase. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract (Article 6 (1) (b) UK GDPR). The receiving Klarna company will handle your personal data in accordance with the privacy notice that applies in your country (see
list
). You can read more about how Klarna safeguards your personal data when transferred outside of the EU/EEA in Section 8.
7.1.3 A person who holds a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
Description of the recipient
: Klarna may share your personal information with a person who has the right to access it under a power of attorney.
Purpose and legal basis
: This processing is carried out to facilitate your contact with us (through agents), and takes place based on your consent (Article 6(1)(a) UK GDPR).
7.1.4 Authorities.
Description of the recipient
: Klarna may provide necessary information to authorities such as the police, financial authorities, tax authorities or other authorities and courts of law.
Purpose and legal basis
: Personal data is shared with the authority when we are required by law to do so, or in some cases if you have asked us to do so, or if required to manage tax deductions or counter crime. An example of a legal obligation to provide information is when it is necessary to take measures against money laundering and terrorist financing. Depending on the authority and purpose, the legal bases are the obligation to comply with the law (Article 6(1)(c) UK GDPR), to fulfil the agreement with you (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR), or Klarna’s legitimate interest in protecting itself from crime (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR).
There is also a requirement under UK law to withhold tax due on the payments. You will not need to do so, or take any action based on the agreement we have with the UK tax office (the HMRC), as we will disclose the necessary information to the UK tax office to support this agreement. If you have any questions regarding these arrangements, please contact the tax office.
7.1.5 Divestment of business or assets.
Description of the recipient:
In the event that Klarna sells business or assets, Klarna may hand over your personal information to a potential buyer of such business or assets. If Klarna or a significant part of Klarna’s assets is acquired by a third party, personal information about Klarna’s customers may also be shared.
Purpose and legal basis
: Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to perform these transactions (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See section 2 for more information about your rights.
7.2 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna shares your personal information when you use Klarna’s payment methods, log in with Klarna at a store, or choose to pay by debit or credit card in Klarna’s check-out at a store.
7.2.1 Stores.
Description of the recipient:
By stores we mean the stores you visit or shop at (which may include the store’s group companies if you have been informed thereof by the store).
Purpose and legal basis:
In order for the store to be able to perform and manage your purchase and your relationship with the store or its group companies, e.g. by confirming your identity, sending goods, handling questions and disputes, in order to prevent fraud and, where appropriate, send relevant marketing. The store’s privacy notice applies to the processing of your personal data that has been shared with the store and that the store processes. Normally, you will find a link to the store’s privacy notice on the store’s website. The legal basis for sharing data with stores is partly the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR), insofar as the data sharing takes place to perform the contract between you and the store, and partly based on Klarna’s and the store’s legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See section 2 for more information about your rights.
7.2.2 Payment service providers and financial institutions.
Description of the recipient:
Payment service providers and financial institutions provide services to you, stores and Klarna to implement and administer electronic payments through a variety of payment methods, such as credit cards and bank-based payment methods such as direct debit and bank transfer.
Purpose and legal basis

In addition, Klarna may share your information with other financial institutions when conducting transactions with your account to complete the transactions. Sharing with payment service providers and financial institutions is performed to make a transaction initiated by you and it is done to fulfil the agreement with you (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR).

7.3.1 Credit information bureaus.
Description of the recipient:
If you apply to use a service from Klarna that involves us providing credit (see section 4.3 on which services from Klarna involve credit), we will share your personal data with credit information bureaus. Sharing does not take place in the event of small amounts or where we already have sufficient information.
Purpose and legal basis:
Your personal information is shared with credit bureaus in order to assess your creditworthiness, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud. This data sharing constitutes a credit report.
If you apply to use a credit Service (see Section 4.1 above for a specification of our credit Services), your personal data may be shared with Credit Reference Agencies (“CRAs”) to assess your creditworthiness in connection with your application, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud.
For Pay Later in 30 days or Pay in 3, this sharing constitutes
soft credit searches
(or “soft credit lookups”) which does not affect your credit file nor credit score. The search is only visible to you and Klarna. In order to perform these credit searches, Klarna will send the CRAs your name, address, date of birth, phone number, as well as bank account number and sort code if relevant, in order to receive the lookups on you.
However, if you apply for one of our Financing products,
a hard credit search
(or “a hard credit lookup”) is performed in addition to soft searches. This is due to our Financing product constituting a regulated credit product under UK credit legislation. This hard credit search will be recorded on your credit file and may impact your credit score as follows:
The CRA will keep a record of our enquiry against your name and which may be linked to your representatives (“associated records”). For the purposes of any application for Services from us, you may be assessed with reference to “associated records”. Where any search or application is completed, or agreement entered into, involving joint parties, we may record details about this at the CRAs. As a result an “association” will be created that will link your financial records.
Details of which CRA we have used for a specific search are available on request.
In addition, if you open an agreement with one of our Financing products, we will share further information on your agreement with the CRAs. This will occur on a monthly basis until the agreement is closed. This will include details of your outstanding balance, payments made and any default or failure to meet the terms of your agreement. These records will remain on the CRAs’ files for 6 years after our agreement with you is settled or terminated, whether settled by you or, if applicable, your business or by way of default. This and other information about you (or, if applicable, your business and those with whom you are linked financially) may be used to make credit decisions about you in the future.
The ways in which CRAs use and share personal data are explained in more detail at;
https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain
and
https://www.experian.co.uk/crain
. The CRAs will process your information in accordance with their own privacy notices and you can find out which ones we cooperate with

8. When can we transfer your personal data outside of the EU, and how do we protect it then?
We always strive to process your personal data within the EU/EEA area. But in certain situations, such as when we share your information within the Klarna Group or with a supplier, subcontractor or store which operates outside the EU/EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the EU/EEA. Klarna always ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data according to the UK GDPR, even when the data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA. Your rights in respect to your personal data (described in detail in section 2), are not affected when data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA. More information about the recipients Klarna shares your data with you can find in section 7.
When you shop with a store placed in a country outside of the EU/EEA area, our sharing of your personal data with that store means that your personal data will be transferred to this country outside of the EU/EEA area.
If you want more information about our safety measures you can always contact us. You can find our contact information in section 12. You find more information about which countries are deemed to have an “adequate level of protection” on the
European Commission’s website
, and you can read more about the European Commission’s standard clauses
here
.
Safety measures which Klarna uses when transferring personal data outside of the EU/EEA
Countries outside of the EU/EEA may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the UK GDPR). Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring:
if the European Commission has decided that the country outside of the EU/EEA to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the GDPR. This means for example that the personal data is still protected from unauthorized disclosure, and that you may still exercise your rights in regards to your personal data, or
the European Commission’s standard clauses have been entered into between Klarna and the recipient of the personal data outside the EU/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country outside the EU/EEA.
Despite the above, if the store where you choose to shop is located in a country outside the EU/EEA, our data sharing with that foreign store (or with that foreign store’s local Klarna entity) means that your personal data will be transferred to this country outside the EU/EEA. Otherwise it would not be possible to administer your purchase. Klarna primarily relies on the European Commission’s standard clauses to ensure the protection of your personal data for such data transfers, but as set out above, countries where the foreign store is located may have laws preventing the efficient protection by the standard clauses. Even if this is the case, your personal data will still be transferred to the foreign store (or the foreign store’s local Klarna entity), as long as the data transfer is necessary to administer your specific purchase.
9. How long we store your personal data
How long Klarna stores your personal data depends on the purposes for which Klarna uses the personal data:
Personal data used for the contractual relationship between you and Klarna is generally stored for the duration of the contractual relationship and thereafter for a maximum of 10 years based on statutes of limitations.
Personal data that Klarna is under a legal obligation to retain, for example under anti-money laundering laws or bookkeeping laws, is generally retained for 5 and 7 years respectively.
We process the recordings of telephone conversations for a time period of 90 days for quality assurance purposes. We will also retain recordings of inbound and outbound calls for up to three years, as well as Klarna employees’ notations from these calls for up to six years, in order to document what has been discussed and decided on the call.
Personal data which is not used for the purposes of your contractual relationship with Klarna or where Klarna does not have a legal obligation to retain the data is only retained as long as necessary to fulfill the respective purpose for our data processing (usually 3 months). More information can be found in the table in section 4.
In some limited cases, the personal data may need to be stored for a longer period because of capital adequacy laws which Klarna has to comply with.
The legal obligations referred to above means that Klarna can not delete your personal data, even if you request us to delete it, as described in section 2. If we don’t have a legal obligation to retain the personal data, we instead have to make an assessment if we may require the personal data in order to protect Klarna from legal claims.
Please note that just because we have a legal obligation to store your personal data, this does not mean that we are also permitted to use this data for any other purpose. Klarna will make an assessment for each specific purpose of how long we may use your personal data. You can read more about this in section 4.
10. How we use cookies and other types of tracking technology
To provide a tailored and smoooth experience, Klarna uses cookies and similar tracking technologies in our multiple interfaces, such as our website, the Klarna mobile application and at the checkout of a store that uses Klarna. You can find information about the tracking technology that Klarna uses, and information about how you accept or decline the tracking technology, in each interface.
11. Updates to this Privacy Notice
We are constantly working to improve our services so that you have a smoooth user experience. This may involve modifications of existing and future services. If that improvement requires a notice or consent in accordance with applicable law, you will be notified or given the opportunity to give your consent. It is also important that you read this privacy notice every time you use any of our services, as the processing of your personal data may differ from your previous use of the service in question.

Privacy Policy
Definition
Our privacy policy is based on the terms used by the European legislator under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our privacy policy should be readable and understandable to the public, but also to our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would first like to explain some of the terms used.
Personal data
Personal data is all information about a specific or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is a person that can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more specific physical, physiological, genetic, mental characteristics, economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person.
Affected person
An affected person is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the controller.
Processing
Processing is any process or set of operations performed on personal data or personal data, whether automated, recorded, organized, structured, stored, adapted or changed, accessed, consulted, used, transmitted, disseminated or otherwise made available, directed or combined, restricted, deleted or destroyed.
Profiling
Profiling is any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain aspects of a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects of work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, the reliability, the behavior, the location or the movements of this natural person.
Pseudonymization
Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be assigned to a specific person without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separate and subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not assigned to a specific or identifiable natural person.
Controller
Responsible for processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or in concert with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by the Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for their designation may be determined by the Union or Member State law.
Processor
The processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, government agency or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Recipients
Recipient is a natural or legal person, agency, agency or other entity to which the personal information is disclosed, whether or not it is a third party. However, authorities which may obtain personal data under a specific investigation under the Union or national law shall not be considered as beneficiaries. The processing of these data by these authorities will be in accordance with the applicable data protection rules for the purposes of processing.
Consent
The consent of the data subject is any free, specific, informed and unambiguous presentation of the data subject’s wishes, by which they declare their consent to the processing of the personal data concerning them by means of a declaration or a clear affirmation.

III. General information about the collection and processing of your data
Scope of processing
In principle, we process personal data of our website visitors and users only insofar as this is necessary to provide a functioning website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly only with the consent of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent can not be obtained for reasons of fact and the processing of the data is permitted by law.
Legal basis
Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, art. 6 §1 GDPR serves as a legal basis.
In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, art. 6 § 1 lit. b GDPR as a legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.
Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation that is subject to our company, art. 6 § 1 lit. c GDPR as legal basis.
In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, art. 6 § 1 lit. d GDPR as legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the first interest, art. 6 § 1 lit. f GDPR as legal basis for processing.
Storage and deletion of your data
We delete or block the personal data of the data subject as soon as the purpose of the storage is eliminated. It may also be stored if provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or regulations to which our company is subject. Blocking or deletion of the data also takes place when a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for conclusion of a contract or fulfillment of the contract.
IV. Provision of the website and creation of log files
Scope of processing
Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer. This is e.g. information like
– Information about the type and version of your internet browser,
– The operating system of your computer or smartphone,
– Your internet service provider,
– Your IP address,
– Date and time of your access,
– Websites from which you came to us,
– Websites that you visit from our site.
– The legal basis for the temporary storage is art. 6 § 1 lit. f GDPR.
The location of our servers is EU (Germany and Belgium).
We collect such technical information in so-called “log files”, so that you can display our website correctly and we can identify the causes of any technical problems, for the technical optimization of our websites and for the purpose of the security of our computer systems and networks. For these purposes, our legitimate interest in the processing of data according to art. 6 § 1 lit. f GDPR.
The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. Typically, this technical information will be erased or rendered unrecognizable at the latest after seven days.
The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. There is consequently no contradiction on the part of the user.
V. Contact requests for product information, a demo, applications or other concerns

If you send us inquiries via contact form or e-mail, your information from the inquiry form or your e-mail, including the contact data you provide there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. The specification of an e-mail address is required to contact us, the specification of your name and telephone number is voluntary.

Sending applications by e-mail
If you apply to us by e-mail, we collect personal data. This includes, in particular, your contact data (such as first name, last name, name affixes, private address, (mobile) phone number, e-mail address) as well as other data provided by you regarding your career (e.g. CV, qualifications and degrees, professional experience) and your person (e.g. cover letter, personal interests). This may also include special categories of personal data (e.g. information on a severe disability).
As a rule, your personal data is collected directly from you as part of the application process. The data originates from the e-mail and the transmitted files.
The data processing serves to initiate an employee relationship. The primary legal basis for this is § 26 para. 1 BDSG. In addition, consent pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a, 7 GDPR in conjunction with § 26 Para. 2 BDSG can be used as a permission provision under data protection law. If the processing of your data is based on consent, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.
Within our company, only those persons and departments (e.g. Human Resources) have access to your personal data that absolutely need it to carry out the application process or to fulfill our legal obligations. If necessary, your applications will be forwarded to the relevant responsible persons for examination. Under no circumstances will your personal data be passed on to third parties without authorization.
Your data relating to an application for a specific job posting will be stored and processed by us during the ongoing application process. After completion of the application process (e.g. in the form of an acceptance or rejection), the application process including all personal data will be deleted from the system six months after completion of the application process. In the event of an acceptance, we reserve the right to retain your application for longer, provided that the entry date is more than six months in the future.
Newsletter registration
We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter referred to as “newsletter”) only with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission. Insofar as the contents of a newsletter are specifically described within the scope of a registration, they are decisive for the consent of the users. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.
In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide your e-mail address. However, we may ask you to provide a name, for the purpose of personal address in the newsletter, or further information, if this is necessary for the purposes of the newsletter.
Double opt-in procedure: The registration for our newsletter is always carried out in a so-called double opt-in process. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail in which you are asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with other e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Likewise, changes to your data stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.
Deletion and restriction of processing: We may store unsubscribed e-mail addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before deleting them in order to be able to prove consent previously given. The processing of this data will be limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of consent is confirmed at the same time. In the event of obligations to permanently observe objections, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address in a blacklist for this purpose alone.
The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its proper course. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.
Notes on legal basis:
The newsletter is sent on the basis of the recipients’ consent or, if consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate interests in direct marketing, if and to the extent that this is permitted by law, e.g. in the case of existing customer advertising. Insofar as we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests. The registration process is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests to prove that it was carried out in accordance with the law.
Content:
Information about us, our services, promotions and offers.
Analysis and performance measurement:
The newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened, or, if we use a shipping service provider, from their server. In the course of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of the retrieval, are initially collected.
This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times. This analysis also includes determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can indeed be assigned to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our intention nor, if used, that of the dispatch service provider to observe individual users. Rather, the evaluations serve us to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.
The evaluation of the newsletter and the measurement of success are carried out, subject to the express consent of the users, on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of using a user-friendly as well as secure newsletter system, which serves both our business interests and meets the expectations of the users.
Unfortunately, a separate revocation of the performance measurement is not possible, in which case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled, or it must be contradicted.
Types of data processed:
inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).
Data subjects:
Communication partners.
Purposes of processing
: direct marketing (e.g., via e-mail).
Legal basis:
Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. GDPR), Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR).
Opt-out:
You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent or object to further receipt. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter either at the end of each newsletter or you can otherwise use one of the above contact options, preferably e-mail, for this purpose.

1. PROVIDER
1.1. FACEBOOK FANPAGE
1.1.1 RESPONSIBLE PARTY
In the event that the data you provide to us is also or exclusively processed by Facebook, Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland, is the responsible party for data processing within the meaning of the DSGVO in addition to us or in our place. For this purpose, we have concluded an agreement with Facebook pursuant to Art. 26 DSGVO on joint responsibility for the processing of data (Controller Addendum). This agreement specifies the data processing operations for which we or Facebook are responsible when you visit our Facebook fan page. You can view this agreement at the following link: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum.
Since a transfer of personal data by Facebook Ltd. to the USA takes place to Facebook Inc. among others, further protection mechanisms are required to ensure the data protection level of the GDPR. For this purpose, the provider uses standard data protection clauses in accordance with Art. 46 (2) lit. c GDPR. These oblige the recipient of the data in the USA to process the data in accordance with the level of protection in Europe.
If you as a visitor to the site would like to exercise your rights (information, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability, complaint to the supervisory authority, objection or revocation), you can contact both Facebook and us.

1.1.3 Data processing for statistical purposes using page insights
Facebook provides so-called page insights for our Facebook fan page: https://www.facebook.com/business/a/page/page-insights. These are aggregated data that provide information about how people interact with our page. Page Insights may be based on personally identifiable information collected in connection with a person’s visit to or interaction with our Page and in connection with content provided. Please be aware of what personal data you share with us through Facebook. Your data may be processed for market research and advertising purposes even if you are not logged into Facebook or do not have a Facebook account. For example, user profiles can be created from the usage behavior and resulting interests of the users. The user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to display advertisements within and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. This data collection takes place via cookies that are stored on your terminal device. Furthermore, data that is independent of the devices used by the users may also be stored in the user profiles; in particular, if the users are members of the respective platforms and logged in to them. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the optimized presentation of our offer, effective information and communication with customers and interested parties, as well as the targeted placement of advertisements. Please note that we have no influence on the data collection and further processing by Facebook. As a result, we cannot provide any information about the extent to which, where and for how long the data is stored by Facebook. Furthermore, we cannot make any statements about the extent to which Facebook complies with existing deletion obligations, which evaluations and links are made with the data on the part of Facebook and to whom the data is passed on by Facebook. If you wish to avoid the processing of your personal data by Facebook, please contact us by other means.

3.2. DATA PROCESSING WHEN CONTACTING US
We ourselves collect personal data when you contact us, for example, via a contact form or through a messenger service, such as Facebook Messenger. Which data is collected depends on the information you provide and the contact data you have provided or released. These are stored by us for the purpose of processing the request and in case of follow-up questions. Under no circumstances will we pass on the data to third parties without your consent.

Your data will be deleted after final processing of your request, provided that this does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations.

Cloudflare Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 28, 2024.
We have updated our July 18, 2024 Privacy Policy to update the contact email of our Data Protection Officer.
This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the personal information that Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.
CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE
Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.
We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information. We will only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
1. POLICY APPLICATION
This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:
Attendees
: Those who visit our offices or provide their information to Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, as well as those who participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Website Visitors
: Those who visit our Websites, including those who may opt to provide an email address or other contact information to receive communications from Cloudflare, fill out a survey, or provide feedback. For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites” refer collectively to
www.cloudflare.com
as well as any other websites Cloudflare operates for its own behalf and that link to this Policy. For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we serve as Registrar.
Customers
: Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Cloudflare (or its authorized partner) and to whom Cloudflare provides Services pursuant to such agreement. For purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall refer to all of the cloud-based solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Cloudflare or its authorized partners that are designed to increase the performance, security, and availability of Internet properties, applications, devices, and networks, along with any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made available in connection with the foregoing.
Administrative Users
: Those with login credentials for a Cloudflare account and/or those who administer any of the Services for a Customer. In some cases, an Administrative User and Customer may be the same individual. In other cases, an Administrative User may be an agent acting on behalf of a Customer.
Public DNS Resolver Users
: Those who use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 public recursive Domain Name System (“DNS”) resolver service, including 1.1.1.1 for Families ("1.1.1.1 resolver"). Learn more about the 1.1.1.1 resolver

.
End Users

1.1.1.1 Application Privacy Policy
for more information about the data collection and use practices for Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Application and the associated 1.1.1.1 Application Services.
This Policy also does not apply to our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.
Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen. Cloudflare does not knowingly collect or share personal information from any person under the age of eighteen. To the extent we become aware that we have the personal information of a person under the age of eighteen, we will delete that information.
When Cloudflare is a reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS records for websites using our Services. We are a conduit for information controlled by others. It is our Customers and their users who are responsible for the content transmitted across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics, etc.).

Customers and Administrative Users
Customer Account Information
: When you register for an account, we collect contact information. Depending on subscription level, this contact information may include your Customer name, the email address(es) of your account administrator(s), telephone number, and addresses necessary to process payment and delivery of Services. In addition, when you use the Services, we collect information about how you configure your account and the Services (e.g., firewall settings for the domains you administer). We refer to all of this information collectively as “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. Customer Account Information is required to enable your access to your Cloudflare account and Services. By providing us with any personal information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us. We also maintain logs of Administrative Users’ activity (e.g., actions taken to configure settings in Customers’ account).
Payment information
: We do not require our Customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide payment and billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which payment method you choose. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or personal account numbers.
Crash Reports
: When our Services encounter an unexpected error, you may be asked to submit a crash report, which may contain personal information. You will have an opportunity to review the content of the report prior to submitting the report to us.
Public DNS Resolver Users
Limited DNS query data
: We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to our 1.1.1.1 resolver.

We may also be required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant registry operators and other such providers with whom we contract in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon the legitimate request of third parties. Registrant data may include the domain name, registrant name and other contact information, and domain name server information. See our Domain Registration Agreement

6. NOTICE TO EU, UK, AND SWISS RESIDENTS
“Personal information” as referenced in this Privacy Policy means “personal data” as that term is defined under the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) and its United Kingdom (“UK”) GDPR counterpart. Cloudflare is a data controller for the personal information collected from all categories of data subjects listed above, with the following exceptions: Cloudflare is a data processor of Customer Logs, Administrative User logs, and some account settings information. In addition, Cloudflare is a data processor for any of the content provided by Customers and End Users through the Services that transits, or in some cases, is stored on, the Cloudflare network. Where Cloudflare is a data processor, Cloudflare processes data on behalf of its Customers pursuant to their data processing instructions.
If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK or Switzerland, please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Cloudflare Services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our legitimate interests. Please note that in most cases, if you do not provide the requested information, Cloudflare will not be able to provide the requested service to you.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object by emailing us at sar@cloudflare.com.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com

7. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS
Cloudflare is a U.S. based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United States and the European Economic Area. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.
Whenever a Cloudflare company transfers personal information originating from one country to another Cloudflare group company or a third party service provider or partner in a different country, we will implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the territory from which the data is exported. We describe the safeguards we implement
here
. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to the United States, we rely on our certifications under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Should these certifications lapse or become otherwise invalidated, Cloudflare relies on the standard contractual clauses, including supplementary measures as necessary for transfers to the United States. We also use standard contractual clauses for other international transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.
Self-certification to the Data Privacy Framework
Cloudflare complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Cloudflare has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Cloudflare has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together, the “DPFs”), Cloudflare commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPFs should first contact us by emailing sar@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.
In compliance with the DPFs, Cloudflare commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPFs to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of TRUSTe, LLC are provided at no cost to you. You have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other mechanisms set out in this DPF Notice or our Privacy Notice.  For more information, please see Annex 1 of the DPF Principles, available
here
.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Cloudflare’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Cloudflare is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Cloudflare shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Cloudflare proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
8. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
Cloudflare  recognizes individuals’ data protection rights. You have the right to access, correct, update, port, or delete your personal information, and to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information (each of these a “Rights Request”). You may email us at sar@cloudflare.com with any Rights Request, and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers and Administrative Users also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at Cloudflare.com.
Please note that before we can complete your Rights Request, we will need to verify that your identity matches that of the data in which you are requesting to exercise your rights. You can expect a verification email under separate cover, to the email address associated with your personal information on file. If you are making a Rights Request on behalf of another individual as an authorized agent, we require that either (a) the data subject must verify their identity and directly confirm with Cloudflare they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the Rights Request, (b) the authorized agent must be provided power of attorney by the data subject in accordance with the law of the data subject’s jurisdiction, or (c) the Rights Request must otherwise be submitted in accordance with applicable privacy law.
For any Rights Request, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist. Where a Rights Request may implicate the personal information of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with Rights Requests to the extent required by applicable law or the Swiss-U.S. or EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. In the event that your Rights Request is denied, residents of the U.S. states Virginia and Colorado may appeal our decision by responding to the email informing them of the denial or by submitting a Rights Request to appeal to sar@cloudflare.com, and we will respond within sixty (60) days. In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Please note that we do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the Rights Requests described above. In addition, Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users. Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domain’s content. Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for Rights Requests in accordance with their obligations under applicable data protection laws. If an End User requests that we fulfill a Rights Request, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.
9. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
Cloudflare will send you commercial communications based on the communication preferences in your account settings. Cloudflare also will send you service-related communications. You may manage your receipt of commercial communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of such emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com.
10. DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS
We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access. We have put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
11. DATA RETENTION
We store your personal information for a period of time that is consistent with the business purposes set forth in Section 3 of this policy or as long as needed to fulfill and comply with legal obligations. The criteria we used to determine how long we store your personal information will vary depending on several different factors. We typically consider the following when determining data retention:
The purpose for collecting the personal information in the first place. For example, if you have an active account with us, we need to keep your contact information during the entirety of that time in order to provide you with support or contact you regarding your account;
The volume, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information we are processing;
The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information;
Whether we can achieve the purposes for processing with less data or through other means
Legal requirements that may apply to the data, such as applicable statutes of limitation or contractual obligations.
When the data retention period expires for a given type of data, we will delete or destroy it. If, for technical reasons, we are unable to do so, we will implement appropriate security measures to prevent any further use of such data.
12. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact the privacy of your personal information, we will promptly provide notice of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective date of any changes.
13. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information covered by this Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.
14. ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS
Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.
15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
If you have an unresolved privacy or data-use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
.
16. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA. It does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.
How We Collect, Use, and Share Your Personal Information under the CCPA
We may collect, use, and disclose for our business and commercial purposes, the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers for the categories of individuals/users defined in Section 1 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy (e.g., email address of Customers and Administrative Users, name and contact information of Attendees);
Payment and customer records information of our Customers;
Protected classification characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, race, languages spoken, or gender) to the extent these characteristics are voluntarily disclosed to us or contained in any  content transmitted across or stored on our network;
Commercial information (e.g., records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or usage histories);
Professional or employment information;
Internet or other electronic network activity information; and
Inferences (e.g., information about your interests or preferences).
The sources from which we collect information are described in Section 2 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The business and commercial purposes for which we collect and use this information are described in Section 3 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The categories of third parties to whom we “disclose” the information for a business purpose are described in Section 5 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
Your California Privacy Rights
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.
Knowledge
. You can request information about what personal information we have collected about you, including:
the categories of personal information;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.
Access
. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
Deletion
. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
Correction
. You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal information and, taking into account the purpose of processing the personal information, ensure it is complete;
Opt-out of sales or sharing
. You can ask that we do not “sell” or “share” your Personal Information as “sell” and “share” are explicitly defined under the CCPA. For more information, please refer to the section titled “Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information” below.
Nondiscrimination
. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you the Services; increasing the price/rate of the Services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.
In order to submit a request to exercise your right of information, access, or deletion pursuant to the CCPA, please follow the instructions for the submitting a Rights Request detailed in Section 8, above. Please note, we reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and may need to confirm your identity to process certain requests using the verification methods described in Section 8. For example, we take reasonable precautions to verify the identities of those California residents submitting requests to delete or access Personal Information.
Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information
Cloudflare does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use. Making Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information under the CCPA.
You can request to opt out of such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information using the “
Your Privacy Choices”
link in the footer below
.
In addition, some internet browsers offer the option to enable opt-out signals such as Global Privacy Control that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Cloudflare responds to these signals by processing them as a request to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information as discussed above.
Please note that you will still see some advertising, regardless of your selection. We do not impose verification protocols for processing opt out requests unless we have reason to question the authenticity of a requester’s identity, in which case we may request evidence of identity and California residency.
