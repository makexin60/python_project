Automated Decision Making
What is an automated decision?
Automated decision is usually a decision that may impact you and is made automatically based on software algorithms, without human intervention. As an illustrative example, we use automated decisions to complete the onboarding process of a new customer or to perform anti-fraud monitoring.
Why is an automated decision important to you?
Depending on the particular case, using your personal data may lead to automated decisions being taken (including profiling) that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.
How do we protect your interests regarding automated decisions?
The rights and interests of individuals whose personal data undergoes automated decision-making is safeguarded through appropriate measures. When an automated decision is made about you, you have the right to oppose the decision.. If you need more detailed information or wish to exercise this right, please contact us.
Marketing
We may use your Identity Data, Contact Data, Technical Data, Transactional Data, Usage Data and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us and consented to receive marketing communications, or if you have purchased from us and you have not opted out of receiving such communications. We will use your Marketing and Communications Data for our respective activities.
Third-party marketing
We will obtain your opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
Opting out
You may opt out of marketing communications at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you.
Further, you can login and cancel the marketing messages in Notifications.
Where you opt out of receiving marketing messages, this will not apply to service messages which are directly related to the use of our Services (e.g. maintenance, change in the terms and conditions and so forth).
Cookies
You may set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Services or Site may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please review the Cookie Preferences.
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Sale or transfer of business
We may also need to process your data in connection with or during the negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving all or a part of our shares, business or assets. This will be based on our legitimate interests in carrying out such transactions, or to meet our legal obligations.
7. Disclosures of your data
We may share your personal data with our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organizations, our group companies, and affiliates (as described below) in order to complete tasks and provide the Services and use of the App to you on our behalf. When using third party service providers, they are required to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
We pass your personal data to the following entities:
companies and organizations that assist us in processing, verifying or refunding transactions/orders you make and in providing any of the Services that you have requested;
third-party service providers with whom we work and whose products, services or applications are hosted/integrated on our Site and App;
identity verification agencies to undertake required verification checks;
fraud or crime prevention agencies to help fight against crimes including fraud, money-laundering and terrorist financing;
anyone to whom we lawfully transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under the relevant terms and conditions governing the use of any of the Services;
any third party because of any restructure, sale or acquisition of our group or any affiliates, provided that any recipient uses your information for the same purposes as it was originally supplied to us and/or used by us; and
regulatory and law enforcement authorities, whether they are outside or inside the Republic of Seychelles, where the law allows or requires us to do so.
Specifics regarding the use of the blockchain
The blockchain technology used in the provision of certain Services operates on a decentralized network, where transactions are recorded in an immutable and transparent manner. This characteristic ensures the integrity and security of the data stored on the blockchain. However, it also means that once data is added to the blockchain, it becomes virtually impossible to remove or delete it.
8. International transfers (Cross-border data flows)
Many of our external third parties are based outside the Republic of Seychelles so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the Republic of Seychelles.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the Republic of Seychelles, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
the country to which we transfer your personal data has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection
(attention third-party website link)
for personal data by the European Commission; and
a specific contract approved by the European Commission, the Information Commission or other competent authority which gives safeguards to the processing of personal data, the so-called Standard Contractual Clauses.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the Republic of Seychelles.
9. Data security
While there is an inherent risk in any data being shared over the internet, we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, damaged, or accessed in an unauthorised or unlawful way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a legitimate business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Depending on the nature of the risks presented by the proposed processing of your personal data, we will have in place the following appropriate security measures:
organisational measures
(including but not limited to staff training and policy development);
technical measures
(including but not limited to physical protection of data, pseudonymization and encryption); and
securing ongoing availability, integrity, and accessibility
(including but not limited to ensuring appropriate back-ups of personal data are held).
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any relevant regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
10. Data retention
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Here are some exemplary factors which we usually consider when determining how long we need to retain your personal data:
in the event of a complaint;
if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you or if we consider that we need to keep information to defend possible future legal claims (e.g. email addresses and content, chats, letters will be kept up to 10 years following the end of our relationship, depending on the limitation period applicable in your country);
to comply with any applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements with respect to certain types of personal data:
under the Seychelles AML CFT Act we are obliged to retain your personal data for a period of at least 7 years after the end of the relationship between us as a company and you as a customer; this period may be further extended in certain cases if so provided by and in accordance with the applicable legislation;
if information is needed for audit purposes and so forth;
in accordance with relevant industry standards or guidelines;
in accordance with our legitimate business need to prevent abuse of the promotions that we launch. We will retain a customer’s personal data for the time of the promotion and for a certain period after its end to prevent the appearance of abusive behavior.
Please note that under certain condition(s), you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information. We will honor your deletion request ONLY if the condition(s) is met.
11. Your legal rights
You have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your personal data. If you need more detailed information or wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us.
You may:
request access to your personal data;
request rectification of your personal data by asking us to rectify information you think is inaccurate and to complete information you think is incomplete (subject to our verification of the accuracy of the new data you provide to us);
request erasure
(cancellation or deletion)
of your personal data; note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you. In addition, please also check sub-section "Specifics regarding the use of the blockchain" above;
object to the processing of your personal data, where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms; in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms; you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes;
require that decisions be reconsidered if they are made solely by automated means, without human intervention (detailed explanation in Section 6 above);
request restriction of processing your personal data, which enables you to request us to suspend the processing of your personal data, if you want us to establish the data accuracy; where our use of the data is unlawful; where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or if you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party, and we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen (where technically feasible), your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format; note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you;
withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent; if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you, but we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent;
complain to the Seychelles’ Information Commission, or you may also contact your local competent data protection authority about any perceived violation and to seek compensation for damages in the courts.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Period for replying to a legitimate request
Considering the various requirements of the privacy legislation we are subject to we aim to reply to a legitimate request within one month.
Please note that we may request that you provide some details necessary to verify your identity when you request to exercise a legal right regarding your personal data.

Automated Decision Making
What is an automated decision?
Automated decision is usually a decision that may impact you and is made automatically based on software algorithms, without human intervention. As an illustrative example, we use automated decisions to complete the onboarding process of a new customer or to perform anti-fraud monitoring.
Why is an automated decision important to you?
Depending on the particular case, using your personal data may lead to automated decisions being taken (including profiling) that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.
How do we protect your interests regarding automated decisions?
The rights and interests of individuals whose personal data undergoes automated decision-making is safeguarded through appropriate measures. When an automated decision is made about you, you have the right to oppose the decision.. If you need more detailed information or wish to exercise this right, please contact us.
Marketing
We may use your Identity Data, Contact Data, Technical Data, Transactional Data, Usage Data and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us and consented to receive marketing communications, or if you have purchased from us and you have not opted out of receiving such communications. We will use your Marketing and Communications Data for our respective activities.
Third-party marketing
We will obtain your opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
Opting out
You may opt out of marketing communications at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you.
Further, you can login and cancel the marketing messages in Notifications.
Where you opt out of receiving marketing messages, this will not apply to service messages which are directly related to the use of our Services (e.g. maintenance, change in the terms and conditions and so forth).
Cookies
You may set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Services or Site may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please review the Cookie Preferences.
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Sale or transfer of business
We may also need to process your data in connection with or during the negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving all or a part of our shares, business or assets. This will be based on our legitimate interests in carrying out such transactions, or to meet our legal obligations.
7. Disclosures of your data
We may share your personal data with our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organizations, our group companies, and affiliates (as described below) in order to complete tasks and provide the Services and use of the App to you on our behalf. When using third party service providers, they are required to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
We pass your personal data to the following entities:
companies and organizations that assist us in processing, verifying or refunding transactions/orders you make and in providing any of the Services that you have requested;
third-party service providers with whom we work and whose products, services or applications are hosted/integrated on our Site and App;
identity verification agencies to undertake required verification checks;
fraud or crime prevention agencies to help fight against crimes including fraud, money-laundering and terrorist financing;
anyone to whom we lawfully transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under the relevant terms and conditions governing the use of any of the Services;
any third party because of any restructure, sale or acquisition of our group or any affiliates, provided that any recipient uses your information for the same purposes as it was originally supplied to us and/or used by us; and
regulatory and law enforcement authorities, whether they are outside or inside the Republic of Seychelles, where the law allows or requires us to do so.
Specifics regarding the use of the blockchain
The blockchain technology used in the provision of certain Services operates on a decentralized network, where transactions are recorded in an immutable and transparent manner. This characteristic ensures the integrity and security of the data stored on the blockchain. However, it also means that once data is added to the blockchain, it becomes virtually impossible to remove or delete it.
8. International transfers (Cross-border data flows)
Many of our external third parties are based outside the Republic of Seychelles so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the Republic of Seychelles.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the Republic of Seychelles, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
the country to which we transfer your personal data has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection
(attention third-party website link)
for personal data by the European Commission; and
a specific contract approved by the European Commission, the Information Commission or other competent authority which gives safeguards to the processing of personal data, the so-called Standard Contractual Clauses.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the Republic of Seychelles.
9. Data security
While there is an inherent risk in any data being shared over the internet, we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, damaged, or accessed in an unauthorised or unlawful way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a legitimate business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Depending on the nature of the risks presented by the proposed processing of your personal data, we will have in place the following appropriate security measures:
organisational measures
(including but not limited to staff training and policy development);
technical measures
(including but not limited to physical protection of data, pseudonymization and encryption); and
securing ongoing availability, integrity, and accessibility
(including but not limited to ensuring appropriate back-ups of personal data are held).
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any relevant regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
10. Data retention
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Here are some exemplary factors which we usually consider when determining how long we need to retain your personal data:
in the event of a complaint;
if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you or if we consider that we need to keep information to defend possible future legal claims (e.g. email addresses and content, chats, letters will be kept up to 10 years following the end of our relationship, depending on the limitation period applicable in your country);
to comply with any applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements with respect to certain types of personal data:
under the Seychelles AML CFT Act we are obliged to retain your personal data for a period of at least 7 years after the end of the relationship between us as a company and you as a customer; this period may be further extended in certain cases if so provided by and in accordance with the applicable legislation;
if information is needed for audit purposes and so forth;
in accordance with relevant industry standards or guidelines;
in accordance with our legitimate business need to prevent abuse of the promotions that we launch. We will retain a customer’s personal data for the time of the promotion and for a certain period after its end to prevent the appearance of abusive behavior.
Please note that under certain condition(s), you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information. We will honor your deletion request ONLY if the condition(s) is met.
11. Your legal rights
You have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your personal data. If you need more detailed information or wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us.
You may:
request access to your personal data;
request rectification of your personal data by asking us to rectify information you think is inaccurate and to complete information you think is incomplete (subject to our verification of the accuracy of the new data you provide to us);
request erasure
(cancellation or deletion)
of your personal data; note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you. In addition, please also check sub-section "Specifics regarding the use of the blockchain" above;
object to the processing of your personal data, where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms; in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms; you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes;
require that decisions be reconsidered if they are made solely by automated means, without human intervention (detailed explanation in Section 6 above);
request restriction of processing your personal data, which enables you to request us to suspend the processing of your personal data, if you want us to establish the data accuracy; where our use of the data is unlawful; where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or if you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party, and we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen (where technically feasible), your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format; note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you;
withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent; if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you, but we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent;
complain to the Seychelles’ Information Commission, or you may also contact your local competent data protection authority about any perceived violation and to seek compensation for damages in the courts.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Period for replying to a legitimate request
Considering the various requirements of the privacy legislation we are subject to we aim to reply to a legitimate request within one month.
Please note that we may request that you provide some details necessary to verify your identity when you request to exercise a legal right regarding your personal data.
