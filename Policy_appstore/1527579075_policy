Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Mimicar app for iOS and iPadOS
Information we collect
You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. We do not collect personal information from our users. However, those who are uncertain about this are welcome to contact us.
Privacy of Children
Mimicar is an app that can be used by children from age 4. Although we do not collect information either, we encourage parents and legal guardians to keep track and monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services without their permission.
Data Breach
In the very unlikely event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and Services has been compromised or users information is accessed by unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures. If we believe there is a risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach, we will post a notice in the Mobile Application.
Changes and updates
We reserve the right to modify this policy or its terms relating to the Mobile Application from time to time in our discretion, and will notify you or any material changes to the way in which we treat your information. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
Contacting us
If you would like to contact us to understand more about this policy or any matters relating to  your personal information, you may send an email to
