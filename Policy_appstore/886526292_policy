What data do we collect?
CtrlMovie collects several different types of information to provide and improve our content and development services to our users. Offering the Service and experiences requires CtrlMovie to process personal information you provide. Personal information includes information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular user or household. In some instances, information is collected in the aggregate that does not relate to any particular user or household, such as the number of App users per day. In other instances, personal information can be sufficiently anonymized that it cannot reasonably identify, relate to, describe, be capable of being associated with, or be linked, directly or indirectly, to a particular user.
Creating a CtrlMovie account requires your basic contact information, including your phone number and/or email address. We may also require you to select a password for authentication and provide a username that may be visible to other users when you post to public portions of the Service if/when available. We receive and store this information and use it to create a user profile and provide you with access to the Service. We may use your email address and/or phone number to contact you with information relating to the Service or to provide support. At such time that the Service allows for you to post or upload materials to the Service, including without limitation text, audio, images, or other media (collectively “User Content”), those materials are personal information.
When you use the Service, CtrlMovie may collect additional personal information, including more detailed contact information you provide, your location, demographics, and your use of the Service. We may also collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID, hardware type, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), the version of your operating system (“OS”), and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address). This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends and for providing you with the correct version of the application.
If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, if you contact us for customer support, we may receive your name, email address, phone number, the contents of any message or attachments you may send to us, and any other information you choose to provide.
We automatically receive information about your interactions with our Service, such as the posts or other content you view, the searches you conduct, the people you follow, and the dates and times of your visits.
We may collect information using cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies. Cookies are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as health data, biometric data, or financial information, unless explicitly required for the provision of our Services.
