Privacy policy.
Locometric works by sending information from your device's sensors to a data centre for processing. This is done because powerful servers are needed to convert the data into measurements and a floor plan. The app never sends your name, any part of your address, any of your annotations (e.g. made with Apple Pencil), no photos, no 3D data, no 3D photo-like data and none of your notes.
The data uploaded may comprise data from any of the motion sensors contained in your device, including the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. The app may also upload textual information that you have entered into the app, such as room names (but no part of the property address or any notes you have entered or dictated). Room names are needed so that the Locometric support team can help customers with scanning particular rooms.
No personal information is uploaded. The app does not access or upload your contact information, phone book, contacts, photos or any data other than that gathered directly by the app itself or that you enter into the app.
The information that is uploaded may be retained by Locometric. We will use it to improve future floor plans, and for future services such as allowing you to edit and download a complete property floor plan from our website.
In addition, we sometimes use third-party anonymised tracking services to report usage data, crash dumps and measure the effectiveness of advertising.
