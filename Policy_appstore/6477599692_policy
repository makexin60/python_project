dpo@Medall.org

12.6 Nothing in this paragraph 12 is intended to limit, restrict or exclude any rights you have as a Data Subject. A list of those rights can be seen at paragraph 13 below.

13.1 As a Data Subject, you have certain rights in respect of the Personal Data which we hold about you, including:
Right of access: you have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data which we hold about you; as well as confirmation of:
The purposes of the processing
The categories of personal data concerned
The recipients to whom the personal data has/will be disclosed
For how long we intend to store your personal data
If we did not collect the data directly from you, information about the source
Right of rectification:** you have the right to require us to correct any Personal Data which we hold about you which is inaccurate or incomplete.
Right to be forgotten: **in certain circumstances you can ask for the Personal Data we hold about you to be erased from our records. For example, you can ask us to erase any Personal Data which we are processing on the basis that you have consented to that processing, provided that we don’t have a separately legitimate right to retain the data. An example of this might be if we are in a dispute with you and need to retain the data to defend our case.
Right to restriction of processing: you have the right to ask us to restrict the processing we carry out in respect of Personal Data relating to you. You might want to do this, for instance, if you think the data we hold is inaccurate and you would like us to restrict our processing until we have investigated this concern and updated if necessary.
Right of portability: you have the right to have the Personal Data we hold about you transferred to another organisation, to the extent that you provided us with that Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Owing to our process of gathering and processing Personal Data, we don’t anticipate that this will apply to much (if any) of the Personal Data we hold.
Right to object to direct marketing: you have the right to object to certain types of processing by us, including direct marketing.
Right to object to automated processing, including profiling.
13.2 If you want to avail of any of these rights, you should contact us immediately at
dpo@Medall.org

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU NO LONGER WANT US TO PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ABOUT YOU?
14.1 You may notify us at any time that you no longer want us to process Personal Data about you for particular purposes or for any purposes whatsoever. This may have an impact on the services you receive from us. For example, if you ask us to stop processing Personal Data about you, you will no longer be able to access your User Account since we will not be able to identify you.
14.2 A request to stop receiving direct marketing will not impact on your access to your User Account.
WHO DO YOU COMPLAIN TO IF YOU’RE NOT HAPPY WITH HOW WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
15.1 If you have any questions or concerns about how we are using Personal Data about you, please contact our Data Protection Officer immediately at our registered address (see paragraph 1.1 above) or by email to
dpo@Medall.org

What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
Cookies are not the only way
to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites
or opened an e-mail including them
. This allows us, for example, to monitor
the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.
If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the
Website Storage Settings Panel
. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the
Global Storage Settings Panel
and
following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.
Do you serve targeted advertising?
Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
How often will you update this Cookie Policy?
We may update
this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
Where can I get further information?

behavioral data of the internet connected computer or device you use when interacting with the sites, such as advertisements clicked or viewed, sites and content areas, date and time of activities or the web search used to locate and navigate to a site.
Certain online information about you or device information may originate from the use of cookies and similar technologies (for example, pixel tags and device identifiers) on our sites or sites of third parties. For more information on cookies and similar technologies, please see

5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We may use personal information for the following business purposes:
to communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle;
to create and administer an Oracle single sign-on (SSO) account (also referred to as an ‘Oracle Account’) and to deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management;
to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process orders for Oracle products and services;
to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services;
to manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems; and
to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
We may use personal information for the following commercial purposes:
to administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters;
to market our products and services or related products and services, and to tailor our marketing and sales activities to your or your company’s interests; and
to provide select business-to-business services to Oracle customers using publicly available information about companies which may include personal information such as the name of a company’s CEO that is publicly available.
These purposes are described below in further detail.
To communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle
If you get in touch with us (such as by submitting contact forms on our sites, reaching out to us via Oracle Sales chat, attending Oracle events or other occasions, sending an email or by visiting social media platforms), we process information about you to communicate with you and to respond to your requests or other inquiries. We can also process personal information to interact with you on third party social networks.
To create an Oracle SSO account and deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management
When you choose to register with us (such as to make use of our communities), we need to process the personal information provided by you so that we can create an Oracle account for you. Please note, this only applies to personal information controlled by Oracle, not personal information Oracle processes on behalf of our customers.
To engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process purchases of our products and services
If you place an order for our products and services, or if you provide services to Oracle, our employees, customers or partners as a supplier or business partner, Oracle processes information about you to engage in and administer the relevant transactions (such as by sending invoices and making payments), administer your order, and help you get started and adopt our products and services (e.g., by contacting you to activate your Cloud services credits). If you download products or services from our sites, Oracle uses information about you to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you did not experience problems in the download process).
To analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services
We may process personal information in order to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, including for quality assurance and training purposes, as well as for marketing and sales campaigns. This includes processing personal information to conduct surveys to improve Oracle products and services. In case the sites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, create a profile, post comments, opportunities or other content, or communicate directly with another user or otherwise engage in networking activities on Oracle sites, Oracle may process personal information when moderating these activities.
To manage the security of our sites, facilities, networks and systems
We may collect site use data for security and operations management to help keep our sites, facilities, networks and systems secure, or to investigate and prevent potential fraud, including ad fraud and cyber-attacks and to detect bots.
To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business
In some cases, we have to process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process personal information in the performance and operation of our business, such as to conduct internal audits and investigations or for finance and accounting and archiving and insurance purposes.
To administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters
If you subscribe to our magazines (such as “Oracle” or “Profit”), we process information about you to administer your subscription to our magazines (including the renewal process) and newsletters.
To market our products, services, events, or related products and services and to tailor marketing and sales activities
Oracle may use information about you to notify you about new product releases and service developments, events, alerts, updates, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns and promotions (including via newsletters). Oracle may also use personal information to advertise Oracle’s products and services or related products and services, and also to have our distributors, resellers or partners notify you about our products or services or their related products or services (such as via joint sales or product promotions). We do our best to tailor your website visit, marketing experience and our communications to your expressed interests. This happens, for example, if you sign up for an Oracle community or program like the Oracle Partner Network or Oracle Technology Network.
If you attend an event, Oracle may process information about you gathered in relation to the event and can share information about your attendance with your company. Oracle may also permit designated event partners or conference sponsors to send you up to two communications related to your event attendance. Please note that our partners or conference sponsors may directly request information about you at their conference booths or presentations, and their use of your information that you provide to them will be subject to their privacy policies.
We may also process your personal information to post testimonials on our sites, but will first obtain your consent to use your name and testimonial.
To provide select services to Oracle customers using publicly-available information which may include personal information such as the name of a company’s CEO
For some business-to-business services, we may collect the publicly available names of company directors and officials to better understand the status of these companies and help inform our services which relate to providing customers information about other companies.
6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?
For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, the UK and other relevant jurisdictions, our basis for processing is the following:

consent
where so indicated on our sites at the time your personal information was collected, or further to our
legitimate interest

Contact information such as your email address or phone number collected online on our sites or offline from our interactions with you at Oracle events and conferences, and used for direct marketing and sales activities will be retained for as long as we have an active (customer) relationship with you. We treat you as an active contact if (i) you have interacted with Oracle or updated your contact details and preferences in the past 18 months; and (ii) you have not made a deletion request.
If you have reached out to us via Oracle Sales chat, we will delete all chat transcripts 90 days after the chat has concluded.
If you have reached out to us via our support line and you have not opted out of call recording, we will delete call recordings 60 days after the call has concluded unless otherwise specified during the call.
If you have visited an Oracle facility, the personal information needed to allow you to enter the facility will be held for one year after your last visit for records retention purposes.
Personal information needed to retain your opt-out preferences is retained for 20 years (or longer as necessary to comply with applicable law).

9. HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION HANDLED GLOBALLY?
Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and personal information is processed globally as necessary in accordance with this policy. If personal information is transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, Oracle will take adequate measures designed to protect the personal information, such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to the terms of the EU Model Clauses or other adequate transfer mechanism as required under relevant data protection laws. Additional country-specific information on data transfers may be provided if you sign up for an Oracle SSO account (Oracle Account) or register for an event.
