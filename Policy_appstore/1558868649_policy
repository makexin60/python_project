With loans we may also request broader information around your financial income and outgoings such as salary, occupation, accommodation status, mortgage details, other loans and debts, previous addresses, spouse, partners and we may request further information to support the purpose for the loan.
Correspondence Data
If you interact with us, we will record details of those interactions.  For example, we will process details of phone calls, email correspondence and hard copy correspondence.

This information is collected at an aggregate level and your identity data is not stored as part of this technical data.
Special Categories of Personal Data
When we provide our services, we may process special categories of Personal Data.  Under the GDPR special category Personal Data includes Personal Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

From time to time members may provide special category data to us to support a loan application. For instance, members may be applying for a loan to finance a medical procedure and may furnish information relating to the procedure. While we ask generally for information to support a loan application, we never ask for medical information or other special category data in these circumstances. It is our policy if it is provided to us to return such information to the member.

You have the right to ask for all the Personal Data we have about you. When we receive a request from you in writing, we must give you access to all Personal Data we’ve recorded about you as well as details of the processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned and the recipients of the Personal Data.
We will provide the first copy of your Personal Data free of charge, but we may charge you a reasonable fee for any additional copies.
We cannot give you access to a copy of your Personal Data in some limited cases including where this might adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
You can ask to change Personal Data you think is inaccurate
You should let us know if you disagree with something included in your Personal Data.
We may not always be able to change or remove that information, but we’ll correct factual inaccuracies and may include your comments in the record to show that you disagree with it.
You can ask to delete Personal Data (right to be forgotten)
In some circumstances you can ask for your Personal Data to be deleted, for example, where:
your Personal Data is no longer needed for the reason that it was collected in the first place
you have removed your consent for us to use your Personal Data (where there is no other lawful basis for us to use it)
there is no lawful basis for the use of your Personal Data
deleting the Personal Data is a legal requirement
Where your Personal Data has been shared with others, we will do what we can to make sure those using your Personal Data comply with your request for erasure.
Please note that we cannot delete your Personal Data where:
we are required to have it by law
it is used for freedom of expression
it is used for public health purposes
it is used for scientific or historical research or statistical purposes where deleting the Personal Data would make it difficult or impossible to achieve the objectives of the processing
it is necessary for legal claims.
You can ask us to limit what we use your Personal Data for
You have the right to ask us to restrict what we use your Personal Data for where:
you have identified inaccurate information, and have told us of it
where we have no legal reason to use that Personal Data but you want us to restrict what we use it for rather than erase it altogether
When Personal Data is restricted it can’t be used other than to securely store the Personal Data and with your consent to handle legal claims and protect others, or where it’s for important public interests.
You can ask to have your Personal Data moved to another provider (data
portability)
You have the right to ask for your Personal Data to be given back to you or for it to be provided to another service provider of your choice in a commonly used format. This is called data portability.
This right only applies if we’re using your Personal Data with consent and if decisions were made by a computer and not a human being. It does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
You can make a complaint
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the local supervisory authority for data protection in the EU member state where you usually reside, where you work or where you think an infringement of data protection law took place.
