Pixel Pals Privacy Policy
Pixel Pals and its developer take your privacy very seriously. Pixel Pals does not sell or rent your data.
Pixel Pals does not use any third-party analytics, or ad frameworks.
Pixel Pals functions completely without an internet connection (beyond the initial App Store download) and thus does not transmit data externally.
