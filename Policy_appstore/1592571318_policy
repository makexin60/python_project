MetaWeather
Privacy: No data is collected. Location is required to retrieve weather data via WeatherKit, but NO data, including location data, is collected in any way.
​
You may purchase an auto-renewing subscription through an In-App Purchase named MetaWeather+.
• Auto-renewable subscription
• 1 month, 1 year options
• Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew (at the duration selected) unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
• Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase
​
*MetaWeather Pro*
For those who previously purchased MetaWeather Pro, your purchase should restore when launching the app. You may also go to settings to restore MetaWeather Pro as well. This will unlock all current features of MetaWeather+ at no additional cost!
​
Any additional features will require MetaWeather+ in the future.

If you have any issues restoring purchases, please contact me at the form below.
