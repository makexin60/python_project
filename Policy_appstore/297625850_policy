Your privacy
Making personal data available is essential if you want to get the most out of the services XING has to offer. Nevertheless, it's entirely up to you whether you'd like to focus on maximising your presence or keeping the amount of information you disclose to a minimum.
Your privacy on XING
What's the first thing you’d like to show profile visitors?
When creating a profile on XING, we require a few details from you, such as your name, job title and location. This information then forms the basis of your jobs network and is always visible to other users.
You then have the option of adding other information to present yourself as clearly and professionally as possible on XING. You get to choose what you share with your network, and what profile visitors will see first:
Present your CV and skills first if you think they're most important. Alternatively you can showcase some of your previous work and achievements by displaying your portfolio first.

What's the first thing you’d like to show profile visitors?
Would you like non-members to view your profile?
Would you like non-members to view your profile?
XING is primarily a platform for members. That said, visitors who aren’t (yet) members can also search for people and information on XING – albeit with limited search capabilities.
Your settings let you decide whether you want non-members to be able to find your profile, in turn increasing your chances of being contacted by potential business partners. Alternatively, you can narrow down who can see your profile, e.g. only registered XING members.

Who do you want to make your activities visible to?
Who do you want to make your activities visible to?
You choose whether to make your activities visible on XING, and who you share information with, e.g. if you update your profile or like a post. You can present such entries and activities in your profile as they provide other people with insights into your career progress or professional interests.
That way, visitors can easily find out what's new with you. If you'd prefer not to share this information with others, you can limit the visibility of your activities to certain categories of XING members, or hide them completely.

Who do you want to share your contacts with?
Who do you want to share your contacts with?
Good contacts on XING are like holding all the aces in your hand. But some people like to keep their cards close to their chest. On the one hand, adding and referring contacts is a key part of XING, and you can embrace this basic networking principle by allowing others to see your contacts.
On the other hand, these are your contacts and perhaps you prefer to keep them private. Either way, you decide whether and with whom you'd like to share your contacts.

Who can send you messages?
Who can send you messages?
Networking is all about communication, and a key part of this involves exchanging messages with other members. Your profile settings let you decide the extent to which you can be reached, and who you want to be able to contact you.
If you're open to receiving new contact requests and job enquiries, you should think twice before restricting this option on XING. Nevertheless, you can use your settings to focus on correspondence with your trusted contacts if your prefer.

Your privacy in search engines
Do you want your profile to be found by search engines?
"Do I have any control at all these days over what search engines share about me?" When it comes to XING, the answer is yes. If you don't want your XING profile to be found by search engines, you can adjust your settings so that it's only visible on XING.
If you're focused on the networking ethos though, you'll be happy to know that you can increase your chances of being found in search engines and generating far more profile visitors. On top of that, it's always good if people get to see a link to your professional XING profile in their search engine results.

Do you want your profile to be found by search engines?
Do you want search engines to be able to find your posts as well?
Do you want search engines to be able to find your posts as well?
It's natural to want people to listen to what you have to say, but you probably also want to know who's listening.
On XING, you can enable search engines to find anything you post in public groups on XING so you enjoy maximum reach. Alternatively, you can choose to keep your posts within the boundaries of XING and its members by adjusting your settings accordingly.
