Some of our happy Clients
The D.A.R.T Sim ECG Simulator is a truly phenomenal product that’s hit the market and can be a huge asset in your CPR training business. If you’re teaching ACLS, PALS, or even just doing ECG courses, it brings an unrivaled realism to your training at a price that you can afford. It might just be the best ECG simulator available on the market today for the money.

I have been teaching ACLS and PALS classes for over two decades and this is the best teaching tool EVER! I am tired of lugging a defibrillator and simulator to classes! This takes the place of both, not to mention the MONEY SAVED! Many defibs at training centers are old, this app simulates the latest tech. Students build the skills and muscle memory needed to defib, cardiovert and pace. The variety of strips cover all the major rhythms and there is even one for STEMI. BP and CPR metronome work great. With an adapter I mirror the app with a projector and use it during case presentations/lectures. I might get a touchscreen laptop with all the money I saved and use it in my code room. Thanks for making my life easier and my classes better!!!

Way better than hauling around a full-size defibrillator & EKG simulator. I love being able to preprogram simulations.

I am so thankful to have found a teaching tool that can adapt to the NICU training setting! Thank you for making sim education accessable for those of us that do not have deep pockets, and inturn care for all, regardless of their ability to pay.
Maxwell Lanovo
I’m a Professor of Nursing at WCU and teach an EKG/Pharm class also. This app puts it all together! It gives the students time to think about what drug is next, refresh on their rhythms and optimize their critical thinking. Love the added radiology films too. Keep it up please.

I bought this app yesterday and spent the day today teaching ACLS. This app does exactly what it promises. The students learned how to adjust the pacemaker on our simulated pt and were able to see CPR in progress on the monitor. I was able to simulate multiple scenarios and generate rhythms on the fly. (you have to STATE the BP and whether or not there is a pulse,, that is what I like about it, I can modify and ad lib as I go.). This is the best 3 bucks I have spent this year. Thanks for making my job as faculty a whole lot easier.

I must agree that this is an excellent app, and it continues to get better. For those of us that volunteer to teach volunteers, there is no way that we could afford to purchase a monitor to use for training. This software fills a huge training gap for agencies in low income areas with small to nonexistent training budgets.
The developer is very responsive and quickly replies to any inquiries about the software, even on weekends! Please keep up the great work and support. By doing so you not only help every Paramedic across the U.S., but you also help to insure that all of their patients in cardiac crisis receive great care. Thank you!

I really love this app! I was looking for something like this for months. I use this program to teach ACLS and PALS more then our company’s real defibrillator. I really like how I can show students the pacer function. The pacer works great and you will see capture when mA are increased! Amazing.
It also has a sync. Cardioversion Function as well. I wasn’t sure of the purpose for a CPR button. It made more sense when I used it for the pulseless arrest algorithms. The CPR button is great because the student isn’t waisting time looking at the monitor. They can then focus on medications and watching the CO2 function. CO2 can be changed to show the students ROSC or poor compressions. I can go on and on about this thing!
