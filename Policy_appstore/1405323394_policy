We take data protection and privacy very seriously at Hallow. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use your Personal Data, and we encourage you to read it in its entirety. Here is an overview of the key points of our privacy policy and practices:
We do not sell Personal Data (as defined below).
We take care to encrypt Private Sensitive Personal Data (defined below) like journal entries or reflections, so that only you have access to that content.
​​Any App Analytics Data that we do collect – in the spirit of improving or personalizing the product, messaging, and content – is studied only at an aggregate level across the Hallow community (e.g., which sessions are most popular), unless necessary for specific customer support or de-bugging.
We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise provide users’ Personal Data to any data brokers.
As is customary for web-based services, we partner with Service Providers (e.g., payment processors, database providers) to support our App and Analytics Partners to study how best to improve our App (e.g., which sessions are most popular). Personal Data disclosed to these providers is encrypted and protected both in transit and at rest.
We do not share any Private Sensitive Personal Data with any Advertising Partners.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit the data of individuals under the age of 13 without obtaining COPPA-compliant consent from a parent or guardian, and we do not knowingly disclose information about individuals under the age of 13 to Advertising Partners.
You may, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, delete your full account and all Personal Data associated with it at any point.
At any time you may opt out of cookies and other tracking or exercise your other rights under applicable laws, such as certain US state privacy laws or the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). Please read on to the Full Privacy Policy for more details.
Your use of our Services is subject to our
Terms of Service
, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service. If we make any changes to the way we collect or use your Personal Data we will give you notice of those changes in accordance with the section titled
“Changes to this Privacy Policy”
below.
By creating an account, accessing our Services, or opting into communications from us, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined below, and you consent that we will collect, use and disclose your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Specifically, we’ll create a cryptographic hash value from your contacts’ email addresses and phone number. Each cryptographic hash value is stored on our servers and is linked to your account so that we can more efficiently connect you with these contacts when they join Hallow. If you would like to invite one of your contacts to Hallow, you can do so by sending them an invitation to our service (e.g., via SMS).
When you send us an email or otherwise contact us.
When you are the parent or guardian of a Child under the Age of Consent and provide their name, email address, and other information related to a child’s use of the Service as part of the parental consent process.

3. Data Disclosure
We disclose your Personal Data to the categories of service providers and other parties listed in this section. For more information, please refer to the state-specific sections below.
Service Providers.
These parties help us provide the Services or perform business functions on our behalf. They include:
Hosting, technology, and communication providers.
Support and customer service vendors.
Product fulfillment and delivery providers.
Payment processors.
When you make a purchase through our Services (does not apply to a purchase made through a third-party App Store), our payment processing partner (e.g., Stripe) collects your voluntarily-provided payment card information necessary to process your payment. Please see the payment processor’s terms of service and privacy policy for information on its use and storage of your Personal Data.
Advertising Partners.
These parties help us market our services and provide you with other offers that may be of interest to you. They include:
Ad networks.
Marketing providers.
Analytics Partners.
These parties provide analytics on web traffic or usage of the Services. They include:
Companies that track how users interact with the Services.
Companies that track how users found or were referred to the Services.
Parties You Authorize, Access or Authenticate
Third parties you access through the services.
Other users, including those in your network. See the Hallow Community section below for more information.
Hallow Community
Hallow’s Community functionality allows users pray with and for each other, to find one another, to connect and to share content as a way to enrich each other’s spiritual journeys. When you share and communicate using the App, you choose what you share and the audience with whom you share it. All Hallow accounts are able, if they choose, to participate in the Community functionality, but you are at all times able to control your Community experience by customizing your settings—including the degree to which other users can locate your account and the content that you share. For example, when you post a text-based intention or reflection you can choose to have that content shared with your network on the App. You can also choose to allow your network to see when you take certain actions within the App, such as listening to a specific prayer session, and to make your profile searchable by others in the Hallow community. Also, when you comment on someone else’s post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person’s content, and that person can change the audience later. The same level of choice exists within the group context. If you choose to participate in one of our groups (such as a parish of which you are a member), you can choose to make your interactions within the group visible to other group members and/or the relevant group administrator. Finally, when you choose to send direct messages to communicate with other Hallow users, those users can see the content you send.
Remember, you should consider what you share and who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity within our App can choose to share it with others, including people outside the audience you initially shared it with.
Legal Obligations
We may disclose any Personal Data that we collect to third parties in conjunction with any of the activities set forth under “Meeting Legal Requirements and Enforcing Legal Terms” in the
“Our Commercial or Business Purposes for Collecting or Disclosing Personal Data”
section above.
Business Transfers
All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before (most likely via email) your information becomes subject to different privacy or security policies and practices.
Data that is Not Personal Data
We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and disclose it to third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not disclose such data in a manner that could identify you.
4. Data Security and Retention
We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational  and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data.
We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data, and we further encrypt Private Sensitive Personal Data in a manner designed to ensure only you and those you choose to share it with can view it in unencrypted form.
We also ask for your help to protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.
We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal or business obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may also retain information in an anonymous, de-identified, aggregated form such that information would not identify you personally.
5. Personal Data of Children
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. Moreover, the GDPR requires that data controllers obtain consent from the holders of parental responsibility over children who are under 16 years of age before such controllers knowingly collect and process Personal Data from such children.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13 (if such child is located in the United States) or under 16 (if such child is located in the European Union or United Kingdom) (in each case, a “Child under the Age of Consent”) without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”). Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. If you are a Child under the Age of Consent, please do not attempt to send any Personal Data about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process. If you believe that a Child under the Age of Consent has provided us with Personal Data (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at
support@hallow.com
. We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent than is reasonably necessary for that participation, and we do not retain Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.
If you are a parent or guardian of a user of our Services who is a Child under the Age of Consent, you may contact us at any time to ask that (a) we stop collecting Personal Data from such user, (b) we assist you in deleting any Personal Data already collected from such user (although note that we may retain information in an anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated form where that information would not identify such user personally), or (c) we stop disclosing Personal Data collected from such user to third parties, but continue to allow for collection and use of Personal Data collected from such user in connection with the Services.
If you are a Child under the Age of Consent, your parent or guardian can view all information within or associated with your Hallow account, including, without limitation, all categories of Personal Data as outlined above, by contacting us at
support@hallow.com
.
For clarity, we do not knowingly collect, maintain, use or share any Personal Data of any users that are a Child under the Age of Consent beyond that needed for authorized purposes, or as authorized by the user or his/her parent or legal guardian. In no instance do we sell any Personal Data of users that are a Child under the Age of Consent. We also do not knowingly use or disclose Personal Data of any users under the Age of Consent for behavioral targeting of advertisements.

To exercise the rights described in this Privacy Policy, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information (e.g. login credentials to your account) to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will work to respond to your Valid Request  in the time period required by applicable law. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
You may submit a Valid Request by emailing us at:
support@hallow.com
with the subject line “Data Rights Request.”
You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.

EU and UK Residents
If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom (“UK”), Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the version of the GDPR retained in UK law (together the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Hallow will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.
If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at

Contractual Necessity:
We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.

Private Sensitive Personal Data (passwords only)
Payment Data

Legitimate Interest:
We process the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers a legitimate interest (as defined by the GDPR):

Contact Information for Enterprise Account Sales
Other Identifying Information that You Voluntarily Choose to Provide
We may also de-identify or anonymize Personal Data to further our legitimate interests.
Examples of these legitimate interests include (as described in more detail above):
Providing, customizing, and improving the Services.
Marketing the Services.
Corresponding with you.
Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms.
Completing corporate transactions.
Consent:
In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent (such as when we process your Private Sensitive Personal Data) you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.
Other Processing Grounds:
From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
Sharing Personal Data
The
“Data
