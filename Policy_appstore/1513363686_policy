Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact Samantha Connolly sam.connolly@cewe.co.uk.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.Privacy Notice

9. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact Samantha Connolly sam.connolly@cewe.co.uk.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

9. Data subject rights
The EU General Data Protection Regulation grants you specific rights with respect to the processing of your personal information:
1. Right of access (Art. 15 EU GDPR):
You have the right to request confirmation of whether your personal information is being processed. If this is the case, you have a right to receive information about this personal information and the information specifically listed in Art. 15 EU GDPR.
2. Right to rectification (Art. 16 EU GDPR):
You have the right to have your personal information corrected immediately and, if necessary, to have any incomplete personal information added.
3. Right to erasure (Art. 17 EU GDPR):
You also have the right to request that your personal information be deleted immediately if one of the reasons listed individually in Art. 17 EU GDPR applies (e.g. if the information is no longer required for the pursued purposes).
4. Notification obligation (Art. 19 EU GDPR):
If you have exercised your right of rectification, erasure or restriction of processing towards the data controller, they are obliged to notify all recipients with whom they have shared the personal data in question about this rectification or erasure of data or the restriction of processing, unless this is verifiably impossible or would cause a disproportionate effort.
You have the right to be informed about such recipients by the data controller.
5. Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 EU GDPR):
You have the right to restrict processing, provided that one of the requirements listed in Art. 18 EU GDPR is met (e.g. if you have filed an objection), for the duration of any review.
6. Right to data portability (Art. 20 EU GDPR):
In specific cases, which are listed individually in Art. 20 EU GDPR, you have the right to receive your personal information in a structured, conventional and machine-readable format and to request that these data be transmitted to a third party.
7. Right to revoke consent (Art. 7 Para. 3 EU GDPR):
You have the right to revoke your consent at any time. We will then not continue the data processing activities which we performed based on your consent. Such revocation shall not affect the legality of the processing of the data that has already taken place.

In accordance with Art. 77 EU GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal information violates the data protection regulations.

9. Right to object (Art. 21 EU GDPR):
According to Art. 21 Para. 2 EU GDPR, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data that is taking place pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit e) or Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) EU GDPR at any time, based on reasons that arise due to your particular situation.
The data controller will then cease to process personal data concerning you, unless they can prove that there are reasons that necessitate protection of the processing that take priority over your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing aids in enforcing, exercising or defending legal claims.
If the personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data for the purpose of this type of advertising at any time. This rule shall also apply for profiling, provided that it is connected to such direct marketing activities.
