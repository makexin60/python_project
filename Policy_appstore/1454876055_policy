If a Data Subject provides consent, we may share the individual’s contact information with sponsors, co-sponsors, exhibitors at events, and/or conferences organized and hosted by Emburse.
Our sponsors, co-sponsors, and/or exhibitors may directly collect Personal Data at their conference booths or during presentations. Individuals should review the sponsors, co-sponsors, and/or exhibitors’ privacy policies to learn how they use Personal Data prior to sharing it.
If a Data Subject registers for an Emburse event, seminar, webinar, or conference, based on the individual’s consent we may share basic participant information such as name, company, and email address with other participants to foster communication and exchange of ideas.

This Agreement covers any Confidential Information whether disclosed prior to, contemporaneously with or following the execution of this Agreement. Excluded from “Confidential Information” is information that (a) is generally known or available to the public through no act or omission by the receiving party or its Representatives; (b) becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the disclosing party, which is not bound by confidentiality or other legal or fiduciary obligation of secrecy to the disclosing party; (c) the receiving party can demonstrate by competent evidence was known to it or in its possession on a non-confidential basis prior to the date of disclosure by the disclosing party; (d) the receiving party can demonstrate by competent evidence was independently developed by it, without use of or reference to the Confidential Information; or (e) is furnished by the disclosing party to others with written confirmation that such information may be disclosed.

The receiving party shall maintain Confidential Information in confidence and use the same degree of care to avoid unauthorized disclosure or use of such information as the receiving party employs with respect to its own confidential information, subject to a minimum standard of reasonable diligence and protection. Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of the disclosing party or its licensors or suppliers. No right is granted in or to the Confidential Information, except for the limited right to use it to carry out the Business Purpose. No licenses, trademarks, inventions, copyrights, patents or other proprietary rights are implied or granted hereunder.
Disclosure and Access
. The receiving party will not disclose to or permit any third party to access the Confidential Information without the disclosing party’s prior written consent, except to its officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (“     Representatives”) who need to know the Confidential Information in furtherance of the Business Purpose and who shall be subject to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as the provisions of this Agreement. The receiving party agrees to notify the disclosing party of any violation of this Agreement of which it becomes aware, and in any event, the receiving party shall be responsible for any violations by any of its Representatives.

Disclosure Legally Compelled
. If the receiving party is legally required to disclose Confidential Information, it shall promptly notify the disclosing party, to the extent legally permissible, prior to required disclosure so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or take other appropriate action to limit the disclosure.  If a protective order is not obtained, the receiving party may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel, is specifically required to be disclosed.
Remedies
. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential nformation has competitive value and is of a sensitive nature, and a breach of this Agreement, may cause the disclosing party an irreparable harm that could not be made whole by monetary damages.

21. Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes
a. Purpose.  This Section 21 sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which Claims (as defined below) that arise between you and us will be resolved through BINDING ARBITRATION instead of litigated in court.  THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM, OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE RULES (AS DEFINED BELOW). OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NOTE THAT OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. Nothing in this provision precludes you from filing and pursuing your individual Claim in a small claims court in your state or municipality, so long as that Claim is pending only in that court.
b.
Scope
. We each agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms of Service ("Claims") will be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration as set forth in this Section. This agreement to arbitrate applies to all Claims that        could have been filed in court regarding the Claims, whether you or we are the first to file a Claim with the arbitral tribunal and whether the Claims are against you or us, or ours or your employees, agents, contractors or suppliers. This agreement        to arbitrate covers all Claims under these Terms of Service, regardless of whether such Claim is based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, common law or equity, including, but not limited to, Claims arising out of or related to: (1) the interpretation,        execution, administration, amendment or modification of these Terms of Service; (2) any alleged breach of these Terms of Service or tort, (3) the Site, Abacus App, Services, any transaction, features or services (whether provided by us or another        service provider), any advertisement or solicitation, or your business, interaction or relationship with us; (4) any charge or cost incurred pursuant to these Terms of Service or the collection of any amounts due under these Terms of Service;        and (5) any statements or representations made by us to you with respect to these Terms of Service, the Site, Abacus App, Services, any transaction, features or services (whether provided by us or another service provider) or any advertisement        or solicitation, or your business, interaction or relationship with us.
c.
Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Administrator
. Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by arbitration pursuant to this Section 21 and the code of procedures of the national arbitration organization        to which the Claim is referred in effect at the time the Claim is filed (“Rules”), except to the extent that the Rules conflict with these Terms of Service. Claims shall be referred to either the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”)        or the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as selected by the party electing to initiate arbitration. If a selection by us of one of these organizations is unacceptable to you, you shall have the right within 30 days after you receive notice        of our election to select the other organization listed to serve as arbitrator administrator. For a copy of the procedures, to file a Claim or for other information about these organizations, contact them as follows: (i) JAMS at 1920 Main Street,        Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614, website at www.jamsadr.com; or (ii) AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017, website at www.adr.org.
d. Class Action Waiver and Other Restrictions.  If either party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis. There shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other Cardholders or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve Claims is limited to Claims between you and us alone, and the arbitrator’s authority to make awards is limited to you and us alone. Furthermore, Claims brought by you against us or by us against you may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with Claims brought by or against someone other than you, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties.  No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any Dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms of Service (including the "Continuation” provision below), and without waiving either party’s right of appeal, if any portion of this "Class Action Waiver and Other Restrictions” provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Section 21 (other than this sentence) shall not apply.
e.
Location of Arbitration/Payment of Fees
. Any arbitration hearing that you attend shall take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of all        or part of the filing administrative and/or hearing fees for any Claim you initiate as to which you or we seek arbitration. Waivers may also be available from the JAMS or AAA. At the conclusion of the arbitration (or any appeal thereof), the arbitrator        (or panel) will decide who will ultimately be responsible for paying the filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in connection with the arbitration (or appeal). If and to the extent you incur filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in arbitration,        including for any appeal, exceeding the amount they would have been if the Claim had been brought in the state or federal court which is closest to your billing address and would have had jurisdiction over the Claim, we will reimburse you to that        extent unless the arbitrator (or panel) determines that the fees were incurred without any substantial justification.
f.
Arbitration Procedures
. This Section 21 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16, as it may be amended (the “FAA”), and the applicable Rules,        except that (to the extent enforceable under the FAA) this Section 21 shall control if it is inconsistent with the applicable Rules. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations        and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law and, at the timely request of either party, shall provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the decision. In conducting the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall not apply        the Federal or any state rules of civil procedure or rules of evidence. Either party may submit a request to the arbitrator to expand the scope of discovery allowable under the applicable Rules. The party submitting such a request must provide        a copy to the other party, who may submit objections to the arbitrator with a copy of the objections provided to the request party, within fifteen (15) days of receiving the requesting party’s notice. The granting or denial of such request will        be in the sole discretion of the arbitrator who shall notify the parties of his/her decision within twenty (20) days of the objecting party’s submission. The arbitrator shall take reasonable steps to preserve the privacy of individuals, and of        business matters. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA. However, any party can        appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization, which shall consider anew any aspect of the initial award objected to by the appealing party. The appealing party shall have thirty (30) days from        the date of entry of the written arbitration award to notify the arbitration organization that it is exercising the right of appeal. The appeal shall be filed with the arbitration organization in the form of a dated writing. The arbitration organization        will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The arbitration organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel which will conduct arbitration pursuant to its Rules and issue its decision within one hundred twenty (120) days        of the date of the appellant’s written notice. The decision of the panel shall be by majority vote and shall be final and binding.
g.
Survival; Severability
. This Section 21 shall survive termination of these Terms of Service, your Card or the relationship between you and us concerning your Card, any permitted transfer, sale or assignment of your Card, or any amounts owed        on your Card, to any other person or entity as well as voluntary payment of any debt in full by you, any legal proceeding by or between you and us to collect a debt owed by you, and any bankruptcy by you or us. If any portion of this Section 21,        except the "Class Action Waiver and Other Restrictions” provision above, is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Section 21, these Terms of Service or any prior agreement you may        have had with us, each of which shall be enforceable regardless of such invalidity.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS  SECTION 21, DO NOT USE THE SITE, ABACUS APP OR THE SERVICES.
