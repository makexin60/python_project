Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to Shazino. Therefore we’ve made a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.
This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our applications.
Google Analytics
We use
Google Analytics
to understand how users interact with PaperShip. For example we use Google Analytics to find out which service provider is used (Mendeley or Zotero) or which type of document is read (PDF, webpage, etc.).
The “Analytics” toggle switch for PaperShip will disable Google analytics for PaperShip once the app has been quit and relaunched
(Menu > Settings > Send Usage Statistics: OFF)
.
If any customer using this app is under the age of 13 or allows such persons to use PaperShip, please disable Google Analytics with the in-app toggle switch.
We (Shazino) do not collect personally identifiable information. Shazino does not sell, share, or otherwise distribute the analytics data that Google Analytics provides except in the event where it is necessary to comply with laws and legal processes, or to respond to lawful requests.
