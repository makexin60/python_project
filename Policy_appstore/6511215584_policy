3. ONLINE AND MOBILE APP ADVERTISING
ONLINE ADVERTISING ON OUR WEBSITES AND NON-SEGA PROPERTIES
We may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google’s ad services, and others) on our Products that use cookies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you on the Products and other websites you visit and applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect about you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests. In accordance with applicable law in your jurisdiction (such as California), we do not share your age or gender with third parties to enable them to deliver targeted advertising to you based on your age or gender in our mobile apps, except that we may inform third parties if we know that you are under the age of consent (see “
Children's Information
” section below).
Information on Cookies: a cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device that allows us to recognize and remember you. When you visit our websites, we may collect information automatically through cookies. Cookies are essential to provide you with the best services possible and are used to improve those services. In addition, cookies are used to remember and recognize your preferences, so that we can provide a better personalized experience for you, and to help prevent fraudulent activity, improve security, and deliver content. We may use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting feature to collect certain information, including, without limitation, age, gender, and interests. You can manage the use of cookies, including advertising cookies, and disable the sharing of data with partners for advertising purposes, by changing your personal settings on your Ad Settings page and/or downloading and installing Google’s Opt-out Browser Add-on for your web browser. You can also customize advertisements displayed through Google Display Network by changing your personal settings in your Ad Settings page. Your Ad Settings page can be accessed through your personal Google account. In some cases, you can turn off advertising cookies on a cookie-by-cookie basis. Please note that the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our Products by unaffiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to access information about how you can opt out of tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.
For additional ways to opt-out of targeted advertising activities under applicable laws, see the “
Your Choices and Rights
” section below.
Please note that these opt-outs apply per browser and per device, so you will have to opt out for each device—and each browser on each device—through which you access our Products. In addition, the opt-outs do not apply to advertisements in mobile applications. See the “
Mobile App and In-Product Advertising
” section below to learn how to opt out of mobile app advertising.
MOBILE APP AND IN-PRODUCT ADVERTISING
You may also receive tailored in-app advertisements when using our mobile apps. We may use third-party service providers to deliver ads on mobile apps or for mobile app analytics. Each operating system (for example iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to express certain choices regarding the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. Because we do not control how the applicable Platform Operator enables these choices receiving personalized in-application advertisements, you should review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems for information on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. In accordance with applicable law in your jurisdiction (such as California), we do not share your age or gender with third parties to enable them to deliver targeted advertising to you based on your age or gender in our mobile apps, except that we may inform third parties if we know that you are under the age of consent (see “
Children's Information
” section below).
Further information about the protection of your privacy can be found in the relevant third party entity’s privacy policy.
NOTICE CONCERNING DO NOT TRACK
Do Not Track (“
DNT
”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “
Your Choices and Rights
” section below, which is a legally recognized browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your personal information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” or “sharing” of your information or the disclosure of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF SALES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PROCESSING/SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR TARGETED ADVERTISING PURPOSES
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your personal information and “sharing/use of your personal information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “
How We Disclose Information
” section above, we sometimes disclose information to unaffiliated third parties we collaborate with or that provide offers that we think may be of value to you. This disclosure of information may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under applicable laws.
We may also provide personal information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our Products, or use analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our Products and our user/customer base. The disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under applicable laws, or, the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of our online disclosure of your personal information for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” for purposes of targeted advertising, please go to the respective Sega property (e.g., sega.com, sega.co.uk, sega.jp, or the specific website for a SEGA game or app) and click on the “Your Privacy Choices” or related link in the footer of the website, or utilize the website popup (please note that opt-out method may vary depending on the website). You must make this choice on each site on each browser/device you use to access the services. You must also renew this choice if you clear your cookies or your browser is set to do that. You may also submit a request to opt out of the use of your email address and other personal information related to that email address for targeted advertising purposes by emailing us at dataprivacy@sega.com.
Please note that if you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference as required by applicable laws.
MOBILE DEVICES
We may send you push notifications through our mobile applications. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device.
7. NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
We may offer opportunities to receive certain services or benefits (for example, money, virtual or tangible items, or entries into contests) by signing up for communications, participating in surveys or research sessions, or conducting other similar activities, which may require the provision of personal information, such as registering for an account and answering surveys or providing additional feedback or information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable laws (each, an “
Incentive Program
”). Your participation in Incentive Programs is purely voluntary. When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program.
8. CHILDREN'S INFORMATION
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to SEGA. For that reason, SEGA does not knowingly collect, maintain, sell or share personal information or non-personally identifiable information from underage users other than as permitted by law. SEGA may identify underage users to third-party advertisers to ensure that third-party advertisers (i) do not collect personal information or non-personally identifiable information about those underage users and (ii) do not show age-inappropriate ads to those underage users.
In this Privacy Policy, any reference to underage users refers to those under the age of consent to the processing of personal information in their country of residence. For example, please see below for a non-exhaustive regional list of the age of consent for our privacy purposes as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy:
Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia – 16 or under
Czech Republic, France, Greece, Slovenia – 15 or under
Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Italy, Lithuania, Spain – 14 or under
United States, United Kingdom and any EU countries not listed above – 13 or under
If SEGA learns that personal information of underage users has been collected unlawfully, SEGA will take reasonable steps to remove such information. If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected personal information about your child who is underage, you may contact us using the details provided below.

10. NEVADA RESIDENTS
Under Nevada law, certain Nevada residents may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such term is defined under Nevada law). We do not engage in such activity as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy.
11. INTERNATIONAL USERS
Personal information may, in accordance with applicable laws, be transferred to countries other than your country of residence where SEGA or its service providers or trusted business partners maintain operations, including the United States. These countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to the country from where you access our Products or, in the case of transfers subject to European law, may not be subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission (EC). An adequacy decision is a decision taken by the EC establishing that a third country provides a comparable level of protection of personal information to that in the EU, through its domestic law or its international commitments. Such third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of our Products to you, the processing of transactions, and/or the provision of support services. By providing us with your personal information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage, or use by such third parties.
Where SEGA transfers personal information it will seek to take account of any applicable legal obligations relevant to personal information transfers. In the case of transfers of personal information out of the European Economic Area, it will, in the absence of an EC adequacy decision for the destination country, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as the EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to personal information transfers between data controllers or between a data controller and a data processor (see https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).
12. MOBILE APPLICATIONS
Several of our mobile products may serve advertising, and some of our partners may collect data directly from your device. Depending on your region and device, you may have choices regarding our partners’ access to certain data like your device ID and device geo-location data.
Certain Mobile Products may utilize third party advertising partners that serve advertisements (“
Third Party Advertisers
”), which may include behavioral, location or interest based advertising (“
Interest Based Advertising
”) within our Products. These Third Party Advertisers may use technology to serve the advertisements and link them directly with our Products, and they may automatically receive your device ID, IP address or geo-location data (limited to country/region) when this happens.
Please note that if you opt out of certain Interest Based Advertising, you may continue to receive contextual ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of the Product you are using.
OPT-OUT FOR LOCATION DATA
Certain Third Party Advertisers in Products may collect (with your permission) precise location data, or street-level location information, about you (“
Precise Location Data
”). Your mobile device may allow you to limit access to your device IDs and device geo-location data (including opt out of the collection of Precise Location Data such as by Third Party Advertisers) through the settings on your device. Please note that your mobile device will not share location information without your permission.
