Privacy Policy
Updated: December 2024
GIAC, LLC PRIVACY POLICY
GIAC, LLC is a subsidiary of The Escal Institute of Advanced Technologies, Inc. d/b/a the SANS Institute (GIAC, LLC and the SANS Institute are collectively referred throughout as "GIAC"). GIAC is a U.S. based company that provides cyber security certifications through its Global Information Assurance Certification programs. SANS Institute also operates its academic programs offered through the SANS Technology Institute ("STI").
This Policy addresses how GIAC, as a data controller, collects, uses, and otherwise processes personal information relating to individuals who participate in the programs offered through GIAC and who visit the GIAC websites that link to this Policy (collectively, the "Websites"). When we refer to "Websites" we mean
www.giac.org/legal/privacy
as well as other websites that link to this Policy. "Personal information" is information that relates to an identified of identifiable living individual.
Note that the SANS Institute has its own privacy policy at
www.sans.org/privacy
and SANS Institute has its own privacy policy at
www.sans.edu/privacy
. This Policy does not apply to personal information that is addressed by those privacy policies.
We need to process personal information to provide services to you. Sometimes, we provide your personal information to third parties, including GIAC affiliate organizations such as SANS and STI, to help us provide our services. If you are not willing to provide your personal information and have it disclosed to third parties in accordance with this Policy, you may not be able to use our services.
Specific Information about Our Privacy Policy
Our Policy is described here in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form. It is set forth in a series of specific components describing how our Policy operates and how it meets certain privacy rights.
Identity of the Data Controller
GIAC is the data controller - the entity that collects and processes personal information or arranges for such actions taken on its behalf by its agents. As such, we are responsible for deciding the purposes for which personal information is used and processed, and how such processing is done. Thus, it is GIAC's responsibility to inform you in advance concerning the processing of your personal information. You may contact GIAC concerning your rights under this Policy by writing to:
policy@giac.org
or
privacy@sans.org
.
Legitimate Bases for Collecting/Using Your Personal Information
The principal basis on which we collect and use your information is when you give us your affirmative consent. However, when you register for the GIAC program, or make a purchase of testing and/or related services from us, GIAC has a legitimate basis beyond consent to collect your personal information in order to provide you with the goods or services that you expect us to deliver, which depends upon us having and using your personal information. In the process of registering for testing services, you will be asked to sign a Candidate Agreement, from which a legitimate basis is created for us to collect and use your personal information. Once you have a formal relationship with us, GIAC also has a legitimate interest in providing you with timely information about upcoming events and/or products in which you may have an interest; so, to better serve you, we will market or promote those events/products to you. Thus, depending on the precise situation, GIAC may rely on one of these legitimate bases in collecting your personal information.
How We Collect and Use Personal Information
To save you time and make our web services easy to use, you may create a dashboard account using your personal information. You may do this by visiting https://www.sans.org/account/. The account dashboard system saves your information and references it to your email address and password. The next time you visit the GIAC website, you can simply enter your email address and password. If you purchase a certification or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We also use the mailing address to send you GIAC brochures and other items of interest.
When you register online for a certification, we collect the information you provide us, including your name, contact information, affiliation, and the name of the certification. We use this information to ensure you are properly registered for the certification you have selected, and to notify you about other certifications that may be of interest to you. We also use this information while fulfilling our obligations to provide the certification to you, including providing you materials, if opted for a certification renewal, and contacting you with respect to the certification itself.
Many employers have purchasing arrangements with GIAC, or GIAC's parent company, the SANS Institute, that may be used by their employees to pay for GIAC products. GIAC candidate data, including contact information and exam-related data may be shared with the purchasing organization's designated contact. In addition, such GIAC candidate data may also be shared with its affiliated entities under the SANS Institute as necessary for customer service purposes. As such, GIAC may share your certification status, and/or the results of GIAC certification attempts, with the entity that GIAC determines, using commercially reasonable practices, directly or ultimately paid for your certification exam or other related GIAC products or service, as well as SANS Institute affiliated entities. GIAC may release to such organizations only appropriately limited information, including your progress, exam appointment date, exam deadline, the results of the test, and any sanctions decisions, subject to the commitment by that entity to keep GIAC data confidential and not to further disclose it to any third party without your express written consent.
GIAC may use outside vendors or third parties to proctor or administer exams we provide or for other certification, accreditation, or licensing. The authentication and validation process may include requiring persons to provide identification (or photographing participants). Copies of such authentication information, as well as the identity of those taking the exams, may be collected and stored by GIAC, but this information will be used by GIAC in accordance with this Policy to prevent fraud and to ensure the identity of those taking the examination.
GIAC may occasionally provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact and demographic information such as name and address. We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. When this information is shared, it is anonymous (i.e., does not identify individual users).
When you contact GIAC, we may keep a record of your communication to help resolve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
GIAC may use X (formerly Twitter), Facebook or other social media outlets to market and promote its offerings and services. Any communications you make with GIAC using these media may be used by GIAC in accordance with this Policy.
Access to Your Personal Information
You always have access to the information we have about you. To review and update your personal contact information, simply click https://www.sans.org/account/login and log in with your email address and password, then click Update Your Account. We encourage you to review your preferences regularly to keep the information current. You may also write policy@giac.org to have the information changed or removed, or to withdraw your consent.
How Long We Retain Your Personal Information

For personal information that we process on behalf of a business partner or your employer, we will retain such personal information in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them.

We may provide access to your personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

When we de-identify personal information, we have implemented reasonable measures as required by law to ensure that the de-identified data cannot be associated with any individual or customer.

Other technologies. We may use standard internet technology, such as web beacons, session replay scripts, and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Websites. We also may include web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use these, in connection with our Websites to, among other things, track the activities of users of our services, improve ads, personalize and manage content, and gather usage information about our Websites. We may also use these in HTML emails, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded. Session replay software scripts capture information concerning a user's interaction with the Websites, including keystrokes, mouse movements and clicks, movements within a webpage and through the Websites, interactions with menus, banners, and forms, and form field entries.

Transfer of Your Information
GIAC generally transfers your personal information to the United States in order to process it (e.g., handle and follow up on your test registration and test results), as well as to store the information for future use (e.g., to comply with your instructions to share information, to provide you additional services). When we transfer personal data, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that the information is protected, including protection by contractors and/or subcontractors, and to ensure that your information is not shared in any manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Whenever GIAC transfers personal information, we take every precaution to ensure that the entity with which we interact receives, stores, and processes your personal data in conformance with the GDPR and any other confidentiality/security requirements.
Your Privacy Rights
How You Can Access Your Information
Your rights in relation to your personal information are to: (1) be informed about its use; (2) have access to your information; (3) correct your personal information; (4) have your personal information deleted; and (5) restrict how we use your personal information. You also have the right to have your personal information ported to others; however, as explained in more detail in the Candidate Agreement, because GIAC's use of your personal information is specific to its uses (e.g., for testing and marketing activities related to our services), it is usually not technically feasible for us to honor such requests because we are not able to exchange that information with another entity with which we have no direct interface or any reason to exchange data. You are also entitled to know if GIAC is using any automated decision-making (including profiling); we do not use any such automated technologies in the processing of your personal information.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time during use of this Website or by emailing GIAC at
policy@giac.org

If your personal information changes (e.g., postal code, phone, email, or postal address), you can change online, physical contact, and other information by contacting GIAC as shown above. If you wish to correct/update/delete information or no longer desire to receive information from GIAC, you can notify us by using any of the information in the Contact section of this Policy. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.
You have the right to file a complaint with GIAC by emailing us at
policy@giac.org
and we will respond without undue delay, within at least 30 days unless we inform you that additional time will be required. In addition, you have the right to file a complaint with your relevant Supervisory Authority (i.e., Data Protection Authority).
If you have an online account with us, you can review your personal information by logging into your account. You can also update your personal information by contacting us.
You can ask us to delete, rectify, or port your data by submitting a request through your account or by contacting
policy@giac.org

If you opt out of receiving promotional communications, you may continue to receive emails and notifications relating to business-related communications.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
GIAC safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Likewise, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.

Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
SANS.edu values the student’s right to privacy.  The college adheres 
to a federal law called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
(FERPA) that sets privacy standards for student educational records. The
 Act serves two primary purposes.  It gives eligible students more 
control over their educational records, and it prohibits educational 
institutions from disclosing “personally identifiable information in 
education records without the written consent of an eligible student.
With certain exceptions, SANS.edu will not disclose personally 
identifiable information from a student’s education records without the 
student’s prior written consent.
Directory Information
Schools may disclose directory information contained in an 
educational record that would not be considered harmful or an invasion 
of privacy if released.  Directory information at SANS Technology 
Institute includes:
Name
Address (city and state of residence only)
Major program
Honors and awards
Dates of attendance
Degree awarded and date conferred
Students may direct SANS.edu not to disclose their directory 
information by completing a Directory Information Opt-Out Form and 
returning it to their student advisor at any time. Students should be 
aware of the consequences of making this request, including 
non-verification of enrollment or degree status, non-inclusion in honors
 or awards announcements, non-inclusion in student research 
publications, and non-inclusion in the SANS.edu Commencement booklet.
Other Disclosures Permitted Under FERPA
FERPA allows SANS.edu to disclose those records, without consent, to 
the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR S 
99.31):
School officials with legitimate educational interest
Other schools to which a student is transferring
Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes
Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student
Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school
Accrediting organizations
To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena
Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies
State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific state law
