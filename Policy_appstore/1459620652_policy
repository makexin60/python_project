We use cookies and similar technologies to create a better experience for you.
Cookies are data, stored in small text files on your computer. The use of cookies allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over a period of time.
In addition to cookies, we use HTML local storage. This was introduced with HTML and is a more secure alternative to cookies. This allows websites to save data into the web browser. We use this to store settings and configurations for some of the components we use, such as sliders and tables. This is not personal data and unlike cookies, it is not transmitted back to servers.
Cookies and HTML local storage can be for the session only, which means they are live for the browsing session only, or persistent, which means they continue for some time after the session. You can see the duration for each cookie and local storage used on this website in the detailed table below.

To provide these analytics and insights, Contentsquare uses first-party cookies and other technologies to process data of our visitors’ behaviour and their devices on our behalf. This may include data like the device’s IP address, Online ID (like a Cookie ID number), device type and screen size, browser information, geographic location (only down to the city-level) and e-commerce data.

The content and experiences tested are only available to users who accept the related first-party, statistical cookies (e.g. optimizelyEndUserId).
