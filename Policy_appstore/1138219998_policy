Privacy Policy
version 2.0.0 of This Agreement was created on May 25, 2023.
BookPlayer is an audio book player app, and we believe that an audio book player should provide a good listening experience which also includes peace of mind when it comes to data responsibility.
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and why. It applies to the iOS, iPadOS and MacOS apps.
What information do you collect about me?
For our base functionality, BookPlayer collects two types of information:
App crash data and performance (using
Sentry
).
App usage (using
TelemetryDeck
).
If you choose to create an account in our app, we store the email address that you share via the Sign in with Apple integration,
If you choose to purchase a subscription to BookPlayer Pro, we do the following:
We process your payment data using RevenueCat, which collects anonymous purchase history limited to BookPlayer subscriptions only. For more details, please see their
privacy policy
.
We will store your library data in our servers, including the files, book progress (total listened time also), and bookmarks that have been added or created inside the app.
How do you use my information?
To provide all the features specified in the subscription service.
To provide effective support to you during your use of the app.
To understand how BookPlayer services are used and to improve our services.
Will you send me emails?
No.
Will you share my information?
No.
Can I delete my information?
Yes, you can initiate the process for deleting your account from within the Account screen inside the app. We will retain your data for a 7-day period in case you decide to contact us via
support@bookplayer.app
and revert your decision.
Can I have a copy of my information?
Yes, you can request a copy of your data we have stored by contacting us via

Will This Privacy Policy Ever Change?
We may need to update this Policy to reflect changes in our provided services, our business and applicable laws. We will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will post any revisions to this Policy on our public Github code repository. Your use of our services after any change will be subject to the new Privacy Policy.

17
+
(iv) utilize any programs or scripts for the purpose of scraping, indexing, measuring or otherwise data mining any parts of the Application or otherwise hindering the functionality of any part of the Application.
18

20
+
21
+
2.1 The Application and the Content are the property of BookPlayer and its licensors, and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.

22
+
23
+
2.2 If you provide us any feedback, ideas and suggestions about the Application or Content (“Feedback”), you assign to us, your entire right, title and interest (including, without limitation, all patent rights, design rights, copyrights and trade secrets) in the Feedback.

3.1 The Content and Application are provided to you “as is” and without warranty. BookPlayer and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “BookPlayer Parties”) hereby disclaim all warranties with regard to same, including, without limitation, (a) all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, performance, accuracy, reliability, availability, compatibility, title and noninfringement; (b) any errors or defects will be corrected; (c) the Application is free of viruses or other harmful components; or (d) the results of using the Application will meet your requirements.

Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.
30
+
31
+
3.3 You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless all BookPlayer Parties, from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Application or your violation of the Terms.

(collectively the
**
“Terms”
**
). All capitalized words not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the other Terms.
4
+
5
+
**
1. Your Membership Rights and Obligations
**
6
+
7
+
1.1 By paying the fixed subscription fee you will become a member of the Application. As a paying member you will gain exclusive access to various features on the Application. This will include a feature enabling you to upload files onto the platform in accordance with the Terms. The files you upload are not to be shared with other BookPlayer members. The available online storage for the uploaded files may be limited based on the subscription plan.
8
+
9
+
1.2 You shall not add, store or contribute any content (“User Content”) to the Application:
10
+
(i) unless you hold all necessary rights, licenses and consents to do so and have fully complied with any such third-party licenses relating to User Content (including paying all royalties, fees and any other monies required to be paid in connection with such User Content);
11
+
(ii) that would cause you or us to breach any law, regulation, rule, code or other legal obligation;
12
+
(iii) that is or could reasonably considered in our sole discretion: (1) to be obscene, defamatory, disparaging, indecent, offensive, threatening or to incite racial hatred, discriminatory, blasphemous, in breach of confidence or in breach of privacy or otherwise objectionable; (2) that would demean, criticize, place in a negative or false light, harm or negatively affect the reputation of BookPlayer, the Application or its associated features; (3) that infringes or is likely to infringe the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any person, or (4) is likely to subject us or our affiliates to any monetary and/or legal obligations.
13
+
14
+
1.3 You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or from your devices. You accept all risks of unauthorized access to the user data and any other information you provide to us.
15
+
16
+
**
2. Accounts and Paid Subscription Packages
**
17
+
18
+
2.1 We may make certain products and/or services available to users of the Application in consideration of a subscription fee or other fees (“Premium Services”), including the ability to purchase products and services from within the Application (“In-App Products”). If you choose to use Premium Services or make purchase of In-App Products via a third-party application store (like the App Store), then such third-party application store will charge you for any such applicable fees or charges (including any applicable taxes), according to their terms and conditions attributable to such purchase.
19
+
20
+
2.2 If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in-app purchase, you will continue to be billed for the subscription until you or we cancel it. The initial price and billing period will be as displayed via the Application. We may change the price at any time, but price changes will only apply to new purchases (including renewals). If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to follow the instructions from Apple to cancel your subscription before the next billing period starts, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Application from your device. Deleting your member account or deleting the Application from your device does not cancel your subscription. You must cancel your Account as set forth in these Terms.
21
+
22
+
2.3 You retain the right to cancel your subscription at any time which must be done via your Apple account. Upon cancellation, you will continue to be subscribed to the Application until the conclusion of the relevant billing cycle, at which point your subscription and access to the Premium Services will cease.
23
+
24
+
2.4 If you cancel your subscription, following the subscription expiration date, BookPlayer reserves the right delete all files being stored on the platform.
25
+
26
+
**
3. Billing Cycle and Payment
**
27
+
28
+
3.1 The membership fee for the Premium Services, the purchase price of In-App Products, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as sales tax, VAT, and any other transaction fees, will be charged to you via your Apple account.
29
+
30
+
3.2 The length of your billing cycle will depend on the subscription type you select at sign-up for the subscription. Subscription fees will be payable on either an annual or per month basis.
31
+
32
+
3.3 In certain circumstances the payment date may change, for example, if your chosen method of payment has not successfully settled.
33
+
34
+
3.4 If a member exercises its cancellation right, BookPlayer or its billing agents will not charge further subscription fees following the date of cancellation. Members will retain access to Premium Services until the billing cycle concludes. The expiration date will be fixed in-application at the time of subscription.
35
+
36
+
3.5 All subscription fees are non-refundable.
37
+
38
+
3.6 BookPlayer may change your subscription fee from time to time, however, any price changes will apply to subsequent billing cycles only.
39
+
40
+
3.7 BookPlayer may, from time to time, offer new members a “free trial” period where subscription fees will be waived for a period of time. To avoid charges, you must cancel the free trial in the same manner as indicated above for cancellations of subscriptions before the free trial expires.
41
+
42
+
**
4. Intellectual Property Rights
**
43
+
44
+
Content uploaded by you will remain the property of the contributor or creator. BookPlayer will not, without user consent, publish the contributed content. However, by posting any User Content onto the Application or its network, you grant us a perpetual, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, sublicensable and worldwide right and license to host, cache and copy the User Content to and from various servers and our associated networks and to play same to you upon your request. You represent that all User Content is stored for your personal, non-commercial use and represent that you have all rights to store, retrieve and listen to any User Content and that you have all necessary rights to grant the licenses and consents with respect to your User Content and for the rights you grant under these Terms.

How We Respond to DNT Signals
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a Do Not Track signal to websites and other online services you visit. We do not alter our practices when we receive a Do Not Track signal from a visitor’s browser because we do not track our visitors to provide targeted advertising. To find out more about Do Not Track, please visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com
.
Public forums
The site may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and avoid posting any personal information.
Child safety
The site is intended for use only by persons who are at least 16 years of age. By using the site, you confirm to us that you meet this requirement. If you are under the age of 16, you confirm you have received permission from your parent or guardian before using this site or sending us personal information.
Payment processing
Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted to us over the internet. Payments made on the site are made through our payment gateway provider. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to the operator which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorizing payment. Information which you supply is not within our control and is subject to the operator’s own privacy policy and terms and conditions.
How we protect your information
Security is one of our biggest priorities at RevenueCat. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
All application data is secured in transit using TLS.
Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL.
RevenueCat audits changes to the application throughout the development lifecycle: architecture reviews are performed as well as stringent automated and manual code review processes.
RevenueCat monitors application servers, infrastructure, and the RevenueCat network environment to detect potential abuse.
RevenueCat uses Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) to persistently store Customer data and does not host Customer data on its premises. AWS is a leading cloud provider, and holds industry best security certifications, such as SOC2 and ISO 27001. Customer data sent to RevenueCat from around the world is sent to AWS data centers located in the United States.
How long we keep your information
We retain personal data during any period in which you have expressed an interest in our products and services, for as long as you have an account with us in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for six years after that to identify any issues and resolve any legal proceedings. We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. You cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.

Data processed on behalf of our Customers
RevenueCat may process End User Information on behalf of its customers. We are not the controllers of this data and act as data processors, and have no direct relationship with the individuals or end users whose personal information it processes.

Data Processing Addendum

We will process such data on behalf of the customer as prescribed in the respective agreements between RevenueCat and the customer. The customer’s privacy policy or other agreement between the customer and you (or your organization) will apply to such processing, and not this policy.

The RevenueCat customer should then provide instructions to us, if necessary. If requested to remove data by the data controller we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
