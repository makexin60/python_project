During the course of dealing with you, we do not expect to collect any ‘special category’ data about you.
How we collect your personal information
We may obtain personal information by directly interacting with you, such as:
creating an account on, or otherwise using, our website;
entering into an agreement with us for products or services;
subscribing to our services or publications, or otherwise requesting marketing material to be sent to you; or
corresponding with us by phone, email, letters or otherwise.

We may also collect personal information about you from third parties or publicly-available sources, such as:
public bodies and regulatory authorities;
analytics providers (such as Google);
advertising networks;
search information providers; and
providers of technical, payment and delivery services.
The legal basis for use of your personal information
We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:
you have given us consent;
we need to perform a contract we are about to enter into, or have entered into, with you;
where it is necessary for our or a third party’s legitimate interests, and your interests and rights do not override those interests; or
where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Particular purposes for which we will use your personal information, and the legal basis for that use, are as follows:
Purpose:
Where you are acting as a representative of an organisation, then to register that organisation as a new customer
Legal Basis:
It will be necessary for our legitimate business interests, namely with a view to providing products and services to your organisation
Purpose:
Where you are acting as a representative of an organisation, to process your instructions and, if accepted, to provide products and services to your organisation (including managing payment, fees and charges)
Legal Basis:
It will be necessary for our legitimate business interests, namely with a view to providing products and services to your organisation
Purpose:
To obtain further information about you and/or your organisation
Legal Basis:
It will be necessary for our legitimate business interests, namely to ensure we are fully aware of all issues relating to the products and services we are providing
Purpose:
To monitor the endpoints of all public interfaces with our systems and networks in order to proactively detect, investigate and respond to potential threats
Legal Basis:
It will be necessary for our legitimate business interests, namely to optimise the security of our assets, systems and networks
We will only use your personal information for the purpose(s) for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
If you cannot or will not provide us with your personal information
Without your personal information, we cannot register you or your organisation (as the case may be) as a new customer.  That means that we will be unable to provide you or your organisation with any products or services.
Disclosure of your information
We may share your personal information with the parties set out below:
public bodies and regulatory authorities;
other companies within our group;
other personnel within your organisation, or any other organisation that is party to or otherwise has a legitimate interest in the agreement between us and your organisation;
providers of IT and system administration services to our business;
our professional advisers;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our website; and
third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal information in the same way as set out in this policy.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law.
To assist in the protection of your data, we work with carefully selected third party service providers who supply cybersecurity products and services to monitor the endpoints of all public interfaces with our systems and networks in order to proactively detect, investigate and respond to potential threats. As part of this activity, Technical Data is:
collected, stored, used, transferred and processed by our chosen cybersecurity partners to help keep our assets, systems and networks safe; and
used by our chosen cybersecurity partners to develop, enhance and improve their security products and services to benefit us and their wider customer bases. The transfer (and retention) of data relating to the latest security threats is fundamental to ensure the cybersecurity protections offered by our partners remain up to date and effective at keeping personal information secure. Where a cybersecurity partner uses personal information in this way, it is a controller of such data.
Please see:
the section above headed “
Information You Give Us
” for an explanation of what constitutes Technical Data; and
the section below headed “
Your Rights”
for details on how to obtain more information on the processing of personal information for reasons of cybersecurity.
Keeping your personal information secure
While we operate within the UK and EU, your personal data may be transferred to (or stored by) carefully selected third party service providers that we work with, located in countries outside of the UK or EU. Where this is the case, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place for that transfer and storage as required by applicable data protection law. If you would like more information about the storage of your data, or the safeguards that are in place to protect your data, please contact our DPO office using the details in the section of this notice headed “Introduction”.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
How long we will store your personal information
The length of time that we will store your data will depend on the ‘legal basis’ for why we are using that data, as follows:
Legal Basis:
Where we use/store your data because it is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us
Length of time:
We will use/store your data for as long as it is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us
Legal Basis:
Where we use/store your data because it is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject
Length of time:
We will use/store your data for as long as it is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations
Legal Basis:
Where we use/store your data because it is necessary for our legitimate business interests
Length of time:
We will use/store your data for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us or until we no longer have a legitimate interest in using/storing your data
Legal Basis:
Where we use/store your data because you have given us your specific, informed and unambiguous consent
Length of time
: We will use/store our data until you ask us to stop
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Where our cybersecurity partners use Technical Data to develop, enhance or improve their security products and services to benefit us and their wider customer bases, separate retention periods will apply (determined by the relevant cybersecurity partner itself as controller). You can obtain more information on this by contacting us below.
Your rights
You have various legal rights in relation to the information you give us, or which we collect about you, as follows:
You have a
right to access the information
we hold about you, together with various information about why and how we are using your information, to whom we may have disclosed that information, from where we originally obtained the information and for how long we will use your information.
You have the
right to ask us to rectify any information
we hold about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.
You have the
right to ask us to erase the information
we hold about you (the ‘right to be forgotten’). Please note that this right can only be exercised in certain circumstances and, if you ask us to erase your information and we are unable to do so, we will explain why not.
You have the
right to ask us to stop using your information
where: (i) the information we hold about you is inaccurate; (ii) we are unlawfully using your information; (iii) we no longer need to use the information; or (iv) we do not have a legitimate reason to use the information. Please note that we may continue to store your information, or use your information for the purpose of legal proceedings or for protecting the rights of any other person.
You have the
right to ask us to transmit the information
we hold about you to another person or company in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format. Please note that this right can only be exercised in certain circumstances and, if you ask us to transmit your information and we are unable to do so, we will explain why not.
Where we use/store your information because it is necessary for our legitimate business interests, you have the
right to object to us using/storing your information
. We will stop using/storing your information unless we can demonstrate why we believe we have a legitimate business interest which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms.
Where we use/store your data because you have given us your specific, informed and unambiguous consent, you have the
right to withdraw your consent
at any time.
You have the
right to object to us using/storing your information for direct marketing purposes
.
If you wish to exercise any of your legal rights, please contact our DPO’s office by writing to the address at the top of this policy (see section headed “
Introduction
”), or by emailing us at
DPO-Office@bca.com
.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
You can also contact us if you would like more information about:
the storage of your data;
the safeguards that are in place to protect your data; or
our cybersecurity partner and its use of your data.
To do so, please contact our DPO office using the details in the section of this notice headed “
