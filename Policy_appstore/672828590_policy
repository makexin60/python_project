1. Personal, Sensitive, and Non-Personal Data We Collect and How We Use and Disclose It
We collect data from you directly, automatically when you visit or use the WGT Offerings and through cookies and other technologies, and sometimes from third parties.
Some of this data may be considered "personal information" or "personal data," some of which may be considered "sensitive," under various applicable laws.
We consider data that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal data (such as your name, phone number, email address, etc.), and we treat additional data, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as "personal data" where required by applicable law.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal data so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a "hash."
We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements.
We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.
If we combine data that we consider to be non-personal with personal data, we will treat that combined data as personal data under this Privacy Notice.
The following chart sets out the category of personal data collected ("
Category

A. Purposes

Information we collect
Personal Information
When you visit or use our online services, we may collect personal information from or about you including your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number(s), account numbers, limited location information, user name and password. We may also collect payment card information, tax identification numbers, driver’s license numbers (or comparable) when you provide such information while using our online services and where we believe it is reasonably required for ordinary business purposes.
Usage and Other Information
In addition to the personal information described above, we may collect certain information about your use of our online services.  For example, we may capture the IP address of the device you use to connect to the online service, the type of operating system and browser you use, and information about the site you came from, the parts of our online service you access, and the site you visit next. We or our third-party partners may also use cookies, web beacons or other technologies to collect and store other information about your visit to, or use of, our online services.  In addition, we may later associate the usage and other information we collect online with personal information about you.
Chase Mobile
For your convenience, Chase offers you the ability to access some of our products and services through mobile applications and mobile-optimized websites (“Chase Mobile”).  When you interact with us through Chase Mobile, we may collect information such as unique device identifiers for your mobile device, your screen resolution and other device settings, information about your location, and analytical information about how you use your mobile device.  We may ask your permission before collecting certain information (such as precise geo-location information) through Chase Mobile.
Additional Sources of Information
We may also collect information about you from additional online and offline sources including from co-branded partner sites or commercially available third-party sources, such as credit reporting agencies.  We may combine this information with the personal and other information we have collected about you under this Online Privacy Policy.
Use of Information
We use the information discussed above in the following ways:
Processing applications and transactions;
Verifying your identity (such as when you access your account information);
Preventing fraud and enhancing the security of your account or our online services;
Responding to your requests and communicating with you;
Managing your preferences;
Performing analytics concerning your use of our online services, including your responses to our emails and the pages and advertisements you view;
Providing you tailored content and marketing messages; operating, evaluating and improving our business (including developing new products and services; improving existing products and services; performing data analytics; and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
Complying with and enforcing applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual obligations and our policies; and
For any other purposes that we may specifically disclose at the time you provide or we collect your information.
We may also use data that we collect on an aggregate or anonymous basis (such that it does not identify any individual customers) for various business purposes, where permissible under applicable laws and regulations.
Disclosure of Information
We may share the information we collect from and about you with our affiliates and other third parties as described below.  In particular, we may share your information with:
Chase third-party service providers;
Chase affiliated websites and businesses in an effort to bring you improved service across our family of products and services, when permissible under relevant laws and regulations;
Other companies to bring you co-branded services, products or programs that you have requested;
Third parties or affiliates in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a sale, consolidation or merger of Chase businesses; and
Other third parties to comply with legal requirements such as the demands of applicable subpoenas and court orders; to verify or enforce our terms of use, our other rights, or other applicable policies; to address fraud, security or technical issues; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property or security of our customers or third parties.
Where appropriate, we will limit sharing of your information in accordance with the choices you have provided us.
We may share anonymous or aggregated information with third parties to help deliver products, services, and content that are better tailored to the users of our online services and for other purposes.
Understanding Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies
We, or our service providers, and other companies we work with may deploy and use cookies, web beacons, local shared objects and other tracking technologies for the following purposes: fraud prevention and monitoring our advertising and marketing campaign performance. Some of these tracking tools may detect characteristics or settings of the specific device you use to access our online services.
“Cookies” are small amounts of data a website can send to a visitor’s web browser. They are often stored on the device you are using to help track your areas of interest.  Cookies may also enable us or our service providers and other companies we work with to relate your use of our online services over time to customize your experience.  Most web browsers allow you to adjust your browser settings to decline or delete cookies, but doing so may degrade your experience with our online services.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags or web beacons—which are typically one-pixel, transparent images located on a webpage or in an email or other message—or similar technologies may be used on our sites and in some of our digital communications (such as email or other marketing messages). They may also be used when you are served advertisements or you otherwise interact with advertisements outside of our online services. These are principally used to help recognize users, assess traffic patterns and measure site or campaign engagement.
Local Shared Objects, sometimes referred to as “flash cookies” may be stored on your hard drive using a media player or other software installed on your device. Local Shared Objects are similar to cookies in terms of their operation, but may not be managed in your browser in the same way.
Online advertising
You will see advertisements when you use many of our online services. These advertisements may be for our own products or services (including pre-screened offers of credit) or for products and services offered by third parties. Which advertisements you see is often determined using the information we or our affiliates, service providers and other companies that we work with have about you, including information about your relationships with us (e.g., types of accounts held, transactional information, location of banking activity). To that end, where permitted by applicable law, we may share with others the information we collect from and about you as stated in this policy under Information We Collect.
Online behavioral advertising (also known as “OBA” or “interest-based advertising”) refers to the practice of collecting information from a computer or device regarding a visitor’s web-browsing activities across non-affiliated websites over time in order to deliver advertisements that may be of interest to that visitor based on their browsing history. Through OBA, we hope to deliver advertisements that are most likely to be of interest to you using information about your other web-browsing activities (e.g., the web pages you visit, search terms you enter, and the way you move through our online services on your computer or device) or your personal profile (e.g., demographic or location information). Certain companies we work with may set cookies and use related tracking technologies, such as the clear GIFs discussed above, throughout our online services or in our communications to support these OBA efforts. If you do not want your information collected and used by the companies we work with for OBA purposes, you can opt out of this form of OBA by following the instructions in the next section.
Opting Out of "Online Behavioral Advertising" (OBA)
There are two (2) ways that you can opt out of OBA from certain Chase ads on third- party websites. One way is through the cross-industry
Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising
(Opens Overlay)
managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). To opt out of OBA, please click on the following link and follow the instructions:
http://youradchoices.com
(Opens Overlay)
. Another way to opt out of OBA is by clicking on the Advertising Options Icon featured on certain Chase ads on third-party websites. When clicked it
(i) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant third-party website and (ii) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the third parties listed for the purposes of OBA.  If you choose to opt out, our service provider will communicate your opt out election to the relevant third-party advertising partners and a cookie will be placed on your browser indicating your decision to opt out.
Bear in mind that because cookies are stored by your browser, if you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and devices that have browsers and you do not wish to have cookies collect information for OBA purposes, you will need to opt out of OBA from each browser on each of the computers and devices that you use.  Please note that even if you opt out of OBA, you may still receive advertisements from us; however, they won’t be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites.
Linking to Third-Party Websites
Chase may provide links to websites that are owned or operated by other companies ("third-party websites").  When you use a link online to visit a third-party website, you will be subject to that website’s privacy and security practices, which may differ from ours. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy, terms of use and security practices of the linked third-party website before providing any information on that website.
Security
We use reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with legal and regulatory standards to protect and limit access to personal information.  This includes device safeguards and secured files and buildings Visit our
Security Center
for additional information about how we protect your Personal Information.
Please note that information you send to us electronically may not be secure when it is transmitted to us.  We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information (such as your tax identification number) to us.
Updating Your Information
Keeping your account information up-to-date is very important.  You may review, or update certain account information by logging in and accessing the “Customer Center” section.  If you cannot change the incorrect information online, or you prefer to request changes offline, please use the Contact Us option on our site, or call or write to us using the contact information listed on your account statements, records, or other account materials.  You can also speak to one of our branch representatives, your Financial Advisor, or your designated account representative.
Changes to this Online Privacy Policy
We may change this Online Privacy Policy from time to time.  When we do, we will let you know by appropriate means such as by posting the revised policy on this page with a new “Last Updated” date.  Any changes to this Online Privacy Policy will become effective when posted unless indicated otherwise.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

1. Personal, Sensitive, and Non-Personal Data We Collect and How We Use and Disclose It
We collect data from you directly, automatically when you visit or use the WGT Offerings and through cookies and other technologies, and sometimes from third parties.
Some of this data may be considered "personal information" or "personal data," some of which may be considered "sensitive," under various applicable laws.
We consider data that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal data (such as your name, phone number, email address, etc.), and we treat additional data, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as "personal data" where required by applicable law.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal data so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a "hash."
We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements.
We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.
If we combine data that we consider to be non-personal with personal data, we will treat that combined data as personal data under this Privacy Notice.
The following chart sets out the category of personal data collected ("
Category
"), the purposes for which the data is collected ("
A. Purposes
"), the categories of third parties to whom the data may be disclosed for a business purpose ("
B. Disclosed To
"), and the categories of third parties to whom the data may be sold for monetary value or other valuable consideration or shared for cross context behavioral advertising/targeted advertising ("
C. Sold/Shared To
").

13. Notice to California Residents
This California Privacy Notice is effective as of the Effective Date.
This California Privacy Notice supplements the information contained in WGT's Privacy Notice and applies only to California residents.
This California Privacy Notice sets forth the disclosures and rights for California Consumers regarding their personal information, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("
CCPA
"), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("
CPRA
"), and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder.
Any terms (including defined capitalized terms) used in this California Privacy Notice have the same meanings given in the CCPA, CPRA, and the associated regulations, unless otherwise defined.
EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA ACCESS, DELETION, AND DO NOT SELL RIGHTS
If you are a California Consumer, you have the right to request:
(1) that we disclose to you what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you ("
Right to Know
");
(2) that we delete the personal information we collect about you ("
Right to Delete
");
(3) that we correct inaccurate personal information we hold about you ("
Right to Correct
"),
(4) to opt-out from the sharing of your personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising) ("
Right to Opt-Out of Sharing
"), and
(5) to opt-out from the sale of their personal information ("
Right to Opt-Out of Sale
"), all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA and CPRA.
More information on each of these rights is below.
In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative.
You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request if we cannot verify your identity.
Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.
Verifying Your Requests
We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide and the type of request you are making.
When you exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, or Right to Correct, we may ask that you provide us with information, beyond your full name, in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request.
If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.
Agents
If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a user's behalf, please complete the applicable request per the instructions below.
You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.
We will follow up to request a signed, written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing you to make the request on their behalf.
The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request and needs to be clear about the permission granted.
Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465.
In either case, please also indicate the nature of your request.
The consumer's identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request.
We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request.
Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer's behalf, we may deny the request.
Requests to Know
California Consumers have the right to know what information we have collected about them (the categories and the specific pieces of information).
If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Know, please submit your request by completing this
form
or by emailing us at

.
In order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
Requests to Delete
California Consumers have the right to request that we delete personal information we have collected from them.
If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Delete, please submit your request by completing this
form
or by emailing us at
wgt_privacy@wgt.com
.
Please note that as part of the verification process, once you submit a request to delete, we may follow up and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted.

Other Important Information for Do Not Sell or Share

Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
Under the CPRA Regulations, a business must only provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of sensitive personal information when such use is not collected or processed for the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer, or does not fall under certain statutory exceptions, pursuant to CPRA §1798.121.
WGT's use and disclosure of sensitive personal information is not used for such purpose and/or falls within the statutory exceptions, and we therefore do not offer this right at this time.
