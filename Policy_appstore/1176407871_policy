Purposes and legal bases
We
process your Personal Data only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes
and provided that we have a legal basis to rely on. Your Personal Data will not

Use of the Apps (for each
app see the information applicable below):
(a)
E-TUBE PROJECT
E-TUBE
PROJECT offers you the option of using the app without logging in. In case of

profile you have created. We use your Personal Data to manage your bike
information associated with your user account. Our aim is to offer you a
seamless experience by enabling you to access your data from any place and any
device. E-TUBE PROJECT also offers a
customization function of the App. You can activate this function though
pushing an activate button (such as “Use bike brand information”) We
base the processing of your Personal Data for the above purposes on the
performance of a contract to which you are party, see Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR.
When
configuring your user profile, you can choose to submit more information th
an
the strictly required to provide you with our services. The provision of
optional information to complete your user profile enables you to benefit from
a more personalized experience on our Apps.
We
rely on your consent to process any Personal Data you have freely chosen to
provide us with, see Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR. In case you withdraw your consent, for
example, by updating your user profile, we will stop processing your Personal
Data for this purpose.
(b)

E-TUBE
RIDE offers you the option of using the app without logging in. In case of
using the app with user registration, the app operates on the basis of the user
profile you have created. We use your Personal Data to manage your bike

and any de
vice. We base the processing of your Personal

health-related data (heart rate and weight information). The provision of optional
information to complete your user profile enables you to benefit from a more
personalized experience on our Apps.
We
rely on yo
ur consent to process any Personal Data you

processing your Personal Data for this purpose.
·
Communication with you
(applicable for
all Apps
):
We
use your Personal Data to contact you (i) in order to provide you with information
about the Apps and their functionalities for the purpose of providing you with
the Services, (ii) to send you information about similar products and/or
services, (iii) upon your request or consent (for example, to obtain feedback
from you in order to improve our products, services and/or marketing
)
.
We
base the processing of your Personal Data on your consent, as well as on the
performance of a contract to which you are party and our legitimate interests
to provide customer support, and to provide you with product and/or service
information, see Art. 6 (1)(a), (b) and (f) GDPR.
·

(applicable for

calculate the necessary product replacement timing, to introduce new products
and test their compatibility, etc.

improve the quality of our products and services, for product development
research and to expand and grow as a business, see Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR.

user
measurement and usage analysis (applicable

We
analyse the performance of our Apps and Services content in order to understand
how users interact with them and improve them accordingly.

rely on your consent to process your Personal Data for this purpose, see Art. 6
(1)(a) GDPR. In case you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your
Personal Data for this purpose.
We
further aggregate user data collected in our database in order to provide data
analysis services (e.g. regarding bike model usage (for example terrain
information, battery use history, errors, etc.), gender ratio, average
speed/distance/riding time, firmware status) to manufacturers of bikes, to bike
brands and to bike dealers. In order to provide each party with the relevant
aggregated data, as a first step, we match on our servers the serial number of
Shimano components registered by users in the Apps with the serial numbers from
our factory database. In a second step, by way of data aggregation, all
Personal Data is anonymized by aggregation before it is included in the
respective statistics so that it is not possible for the manufacturer or dealer
to directly or indirectly identify you.
For
this purpose, we rely
on our legitimate interests to
provide the added services to our cooperation partners and on the legitimate
interests of our cooperation partners to be able to analyze model usage
,
see Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR.

which you are party, as well as on our legitimate interests in prosecuting any
misuse of our Apps which could affect us and could have legal consequences, see
Art. 6 (1)(b) and (f) GDPR.

the above purposes require or involve the processing of Sensitive Data, we will
ask for your express consent, as required by law, see Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR.

consumers, including by identifying specific categories of data. We collect
Personal Data directly from consumers, automatically when consumers use our

you use a social media account to register to SHIMANO ID). As we describe in
more detail above in the “Information We Collect” section of this Notice, we
have collected the following categories of Personal Data in the past 12 months
in the context of each App:

For
information about our business or commercial purpose(s) for collecting, or
possibly sharing, your Personal Data, please refer to the “Purposes and Legal
Bases” section of the Notice above.
How
We Disclose Personal Data
We
may disclose your Personal Data to third parties as described in the
“Recipients of Personal Data” section of the Notice above. We do not “sell” or
“share” Personal Data as those terms are defined under California law.
California law also requires that we provide you with information about certain
disclosures of Personal Data to third parties, where the disclosures are made
for “business purposes”, such as disclosures to service providers. We disclose
the following types of Personal Data for our business purposes:

California
Rights
California
law grants certain rights to California consumers. These include the rights to:
·
Access specific pieces of
Personal Data (“
Right to Access
”)
·
Learn about how we process
and share Personal Data (“
Right to Know
”)
·
Correct inaccurate or
incomplete Personal Data (“
Right to Correct
”)
·
Request deletion of Personal
Data we collected from you (
“Right to Request Deletion
”)
·
Opt out of “sales” and
“sharing” of Personal Data, as defined under California law
·
Restrict certain uses and
disclosures of Personal Data that is considered sensitive personal information
under California law
·
Not to be denied goods or
services for exercising these rights
To
exercise the Right to Access, Right to Know, Right to Correct, or Right to
Request Deletion: please contact us at
privacy@shimano-eu.com
or
+1-800-423-2420
.
Only you or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a
request related to your Personal Data. A request to exercise any of these
rights must (1) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably
verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data (or an
authorized representative of that person); and (2) describe your request with
sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to your
request. We will verify your identity by sending email to your registered email
address and confirming reply from your email address. In certain cases, we may
need to ask for more information. We may not be able to respond to your request
or provide you with the information you requested if we are unable to verify
your identity (or establish the authority of an authorized agent acting on your
behalf). Authorized agents wishing to exercise rights on behalf of a California
consumer should submit requests to
privacy@shimano-eu.com
along with a copy of the consumer’s signed authorization designating you as
their agent.
If you do not have an account with SHIMANO,
while you may contact us at
privacy@shimano-eu.com
with questions or concerns, we may not be able to respond to requests to
exercise your rights under California law, including the right to know or
delete your Personal Data. Because we only collect limited data about
individuals without an account, we are unable to verify requests from
non-accountholders to the standard required by California law.
Additionally,
under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents have the
right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established
business relationship, (a) a list of the categories of personal data that a
business has disclosed to third parties during the immediately preceding
calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and (b) the
names and addresses of such third parties. To exercise this right, please
contact us at
privacy@shimano-eu.com
.

you have any questions regarding the processing of your Personal Data, please
