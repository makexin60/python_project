As such, TRX complies with all requirements of Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 10, 2023 on the general product safety, amending Regulation (EU) No. 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and the Council, and repealing Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directive 87/357/EEC.
As such, TRX provides (in compliance with Article 19):
Name: TRX, Registered Trade Name: TRX®, Postal address: 1110 South Federal Highway, Delray Beach, Florida 33483, USA, Email address:
legal@trxtraining.com
.
Product identification and details, including a picture, type, and other identifier can be found on the physical box of the product, on the webpage of the product as sold or using one of the numerous other registered branded elements of TRX. The website trxtraining.com is the primary source of all product identification, details, pictures and other identifier and all these products sold online are indexed in a simple and comprehensive way to help buyers secure this information. TRX also offers a 24/7 customer service hotline and other tools to help all customers secure all information required under the Regulation.
TRX has a long history of prioritizing safety and warnings on all its products which require such safety warnings. TRX provides with use-based tips on key safety elements on the website trxtraining.com, on its App and on multiple trade channels such as YouTube®. Also, every product sold by TRX is sold with diagrams and illustrations that can easily be understood in any language of the Union. In addition to existing safety information, TRX offers certifications and online training on how to best use all of its products safely. This information can be found at trxtraining.com/education. TRX provides the following key elements:
Suspension Training® family of products (aka strap-based products): These products are sold with one or more anchoring solution ranging from a door anchor, an anchor for rounded elements like a tree or a pole, and an anchor for a fixed point. Each trainer must be carefully examined for integrity and lack of visible use. Please replace the product or call customer service if any issue is visible. Warranty of manufacture is limited to two years and TRX strongly recommends replacement at the end of the recommended period of use. Always use over a soft area like grass, an exercise mat or carpet. Please do not use with wet hands. Test integrity of product before exercise us by conducting a simple weight test. Hold the handles at mid-height and bend knees putting your bodyweight on the product and in the anchor point. In case of any movement at the anchor point, please correct the fixation point. Specific videos on proper installation can be found on trxtraining.com. TRX does not recommend you use the product without an official TRX anchor.
TRX family of anchoring solutions: All anchors must be installed on fixed surfaces carefully. When bolting is required, please secure as instructed on the product guide. It is important after installation to conduct a test by applying a full body test. Simply attach a weight to the handle of the trainer in upper position once the Suspension Training® product is attached to the anchor. The weight as selected should be at least equal to the full bodyweight of the individual using the product.
YBELL / Weights / Kettlebells family of products: Please do not drop the weight on any part of the body. Do not use with a poor grip, for example do not use when hands are wet or when muscles are tired. Do not place the weights directly above the head and use ordinary care in the common use of exercise and fitness weights.
RIP® Trainer, Bandit & Resistance Bands: Please anchor to a point as instructed and use a TRX anchor as described above. Please test the anchor as instructed above prior to use. As for angle of use, do not pull or place strain in the elastic bands directly pointing to your facial area. Exercise and pull on the bands away from the face. Do not point the tip of the RIP® toward any individual or person in proximity. Exercise alone and at least 60 cm from another person.
TRX Strength Training Equipment family of products; All TRX tools must be used as is commonly used for gym-based fitness equipment and only for its intended purpose. Medicine balls, slam balls and power bags must only be used as normally used to train certain muscle groups and as illustrated in the instruction videos found at trxtraining.com.
TRX Racks: The use of TRX racks for weights must be used according to normal protocols and only the TRX weights should be placed on the racks. No pressure should be applied laterally on the top metal plate of the vertical rack of TRX to tip it over. The vertical rack should be placed next to a wall to avoid back tipping. TRX recommends 5-10 cm from a flat wall.
TRX Studio Line™: TRX also sells in the commercial setting its Studio Line, and such a large product comes with its own instruction and is normally not sold directly online. If purchased online, please communicate with
legal@trxtraining.com

If you reside in a member country of the EU, the UK or Switzerland, TRX does self-certify that it complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, “Privacy Shield”) as set out by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  TRX has self-certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer (including our Data Processors or other third parties as permitted in this Policy), security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. Under the Privacy Shield’s “Onward Transfer Principle”, we may remain liable for the processing of Personal Data of EU, UK or Swiss residents that we transfer to our Data Processors or other third party service providers or agents. In certain situations, we may be also required to disclose Personal Data in order to comply with lawful requests from public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement purposes.

NOTICE
:
On July 10, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) entered into force.
The Department of Commerce has announced that the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework will go into effect on July 17, 2023.
With regard to the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, the Department of Commerce stated the following:
Effective July 17, 2023, eligible organizations in the United States  that wish to self-certify their compliance pursuant to the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF may do so; however, they may not begin relying on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF to receive personal data transfers from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) before the date that the United Kingdom’s anticipated adequacy regulations implementing the data bridge for the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF enter into force.  Organizations that wish to participate in the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF must also participate in the EU-U.S. DPF.
For additional information and updates, please go to the official DPF website of the Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration:
www.dataprivacyframework.go

The
Privacy Shield Program
, which is administered by the International Trade Administration within the Department of Commerce, allows U.S.-based organizations to join one or both of the Frameworks. While participation is voluntary, organizations that opt to participate are required to self-certify and commit to compliance with the Frameworks’ requirements.
