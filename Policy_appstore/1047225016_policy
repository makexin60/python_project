3.5. Face Data Collection, Usage, and Storage
3.5.1. Purpose of Collecting Face Data
At CEX.IO, we use face data as part of our liveness check during the user verification process. This is essential for:
Identity Verification: Ensuring that the person verifying their identity is physically present and not using a photo or video, which helps prevent identity fraud.
Security: Adding an extra layer of security to ensure the authenticity of the user during the verification process.
Fraud Prevention: Detecting and preventing potential attempts to bypass security measures, ensuring that the verification process remains secure and trustworthy. Verifying that the individual accessing our services is indeed who they claim to be.
Regulatory Compliance: Meeting legal and regulatory requirements that mandate secure identity verification methods for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.
By utilising face data in the liveness check, we ensure a more secure and reliable verification process for all users.
3.5.2. Storage and Retention of Face Data
Face data is stored securely in compliance with regulatory requirements that CEX.IO must adhere to. We implement robust security measures to protect this data. We retain face data for a period of five to eight years, depending on local regulatory body requirements. This retention period starts from the date of the user’s last transaction or the end of the tax period in which the last transaction occurred. This duration is necessary to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and to ensure we can respond to any legal or compliance inquiries that may arise during this period.
We are committed to ensuring that face data is handled securely and stored only for as long as necessary and required by legal and regulatory requirements to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. Our approach to the storage and retention of face data is governed by the following principles:
Limited Retention Period:
Face data is stored only for the duration needed to complete the verification process or meet the legal requirements related to identity verification. Once the verification is complete, we retain the data for a specific period in accordance with regulatory obligations and internal policies.
Purpose-Specific Retention:
We store face data for the following purposes:
Identity Verification: Retained for a limited period to allow for audits or disputes related to the verification process.
Fraud Prevention and Security: Retained to detect and prevent potential fraud during and after the verification process.
Data Deletion Policy:
Once face data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected for, or after the retention period has passed, it is securely deleted. We do not retain face data indefinitely.
Compliance with Legal Requirements:
Our retention policy complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection regulations. Face data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, in accordance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.
User Rights:
Users have the right to request the deletion of their face data at any time, in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We ensure a transparent and easy process for users to exercise this right.
By adhering to these principles, we aim to balance the need for effective user verification and security with the rights and privacy of our users.
3.5.3. Sharing of Face Data with Third Parties
We prioritise the security and privacy of face data and only share it with third parties when absolutely necessary. Our approach to sharing face data is guided by the following principles:
Limited Sharing:
We share face data with third parties only when it is essential to provide our services or comply with legal obligations. The main purposes for sharing face data include:
Identity Verification Providers: We may share face data with trusted service providers who assist us in conducting secure user verification and liveness checks.
Cloud Storage Providers: Face data may be stored securely by third-party cloud service providers who are bound by strict data protection agreements.
Security and Fraud Prevention Partners: We may share data with specialised security vendors to help detect and prevent fraud during the verification process.
Banks and Payment Providers: We may share face data with banks and payment providers upon request for investigation related to specific transactions.
Regulatory Authorities: If required by law or to comply with legal obligations, we may share face data with government or regulatory bodies to meet legal requirements or respond to law enforcement requests.
Robust Data Protection Agreements:
All third parties we share face data with are required to comply with strict contractual agreements that meet or exceed applicable data protection laws. These agreements ensure that third parties use the data solely for the purposes we have defined and apply stringent security measures to protect the data.
No Unauthorised Use:
We do not permit third parties to use face data for any purpose other than what is explicitly stated in our agreements. Third parties are prohibited from using the data for advertising, analytics, or any other purposes outside of those required for verification or security.
Data Retention by Third Parties:
Some third parties, such as identity verification providers, may retain face data for a limited period to comply with legal or contractual obligations. We ensure that any third-party data retention policies are consistent with our own practices, and they are required to delete or anonymize face data once it is no longer needed.
Transparency and User Rights:
We provide transparency to our users about which third parties may have access to their face data and the reasons for such sharing. Users also have the right to request information about third-party sharing and to request deletion of their face data.
By adhering to these principles, we ensure that face data is shared responsibly and securely, maintaining the privacy and trust of our users.
3.5.4. Third-Party Data Storage and Practices
When we share face data with third parties, we ensure that their data storage practices align with the highest standards of privacy and security. Below is an outline of how third-party data storage is handled, along with our measures to protect user privacy:
Data Storage by Third Parties:
Some third parties, such as identity verification providers and cloud storage services, may store face data temporarily to assist us in completing the user verification process. The specific practices include:
Secure Cloud Storage: Third-party providers may store face data on secure servers that use encryption and advanced security measures to protect data from unauthorised access.
Temporary Retention: In most cases, third parties only store face data for the duration necessary to complete verification, after which the data is either securely deleted or anonymized.
Privacy Practices of Third Parties:
We carefully vet all third-party providers to ensure their privacy practices are compliant with applicable data protection regulations, such as the GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws. Their privacy practices must include:
Limited Data Usage: Third parties are prohibited from using face data for any purpose other than those specified by us, such as verification and fraud prevention.
Security Measures: They are required to implement strong security protocols, such as encryption and secure access controls, to safeguard face data.
Compliance with Regulations: Third parties must adhere to relevant data protection regulations, and we regularly review their compliance.
Data Retention Policies:
If third parties retain face data, they are bound by specific retention policies that comply with the following guidelines:
Purpose-Limited Retention: Face data is only retained for the period necessary to fulfil the specific purpose (e.g., user verification or fraud detection).
Deletion or Anonymization: Once the data is no longer needed, third parties must either securely delete it or anonymize it to ensure it cannot be linked to individual users.
Reasons for Third-Party Data Storage:
Third parties may store face data for the following reasons:
Verification Records: To maintain an audit trail of user verification for compliance with legal or contractual requirements.
Fraud Prevention: To identify and prevent repeated or attempted fraud during the verification process.
By enforcing strict data storage and privacy practices with our third-party partners, we ensure that face data is handled securely and in compliance with all relevant privacy laws.
3.5.5. User Rights
Users can access, correct, or request the deletion of their face data by contacting our Support Team. However, please note that we may need to retain personal information if required by data protection laws for specific purposes, such as regulatory compliance or defending legal claims. In such cases, we will inform you and provide an explanation if this applies.
3.5.6. Additional Information

AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions.
