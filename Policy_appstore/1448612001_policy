Privacy Policy
Last updated: 11 January 2019
SenSense does not collect or store any names or email addresses. Our focus is entirely on making a fun game.
SenSense is built using the
Unity Game Engine
and uses
Unity Networking
to connect you to your collaborators. Your
ip address
is required to communicate between your phones. You can still play SenSense over a local wifi connection if you do not wish Unity Networking to access your ip address.
SenSense also implements
Unity Analytics
which stores basic details about your experience with the game. It makes us very happy to see when people are playing our game and provides helpful information on how to improve it and correct any issues. You can choose to change your Unity Analytics data privacy settings by clicking on the information icon on the create/join game screen.
