Melon VPN Privacy Policy
Last Updated: November 28, 2024
At Melon VPN, we prioritize your privacy. Our core principle is to collect only the minimum data necessary to provide high-quality VPN services. Here’s what you need to know:
1. Data Collection and Usage
We do not collect your browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries.
We do not keep connection logs, such as IP addresses, connection timestamps, or session duration.
We only collect and use information necessary to provide services, improve our products, and support customers.
Network Speed Test:
To provide network speed testing, we may temporarily collect anonymous network performance data (e.g., speed, latency, and packet loss). This data is not linked to your personal identity and is not stored on our servers.
Browser Feature:
Our built-in browser does not track users’ browsing history or activity but may collect anonymous usage statistics (e.g., feature usage frequency) to improve user experience.
2. Data Protection
We implement high standards of security to protect your data.
Our servers are located in secure data centers and do not require user data logging.
We only share information with third parties when legally required or with your explicit consent.
3. Subscription and Login Features
Melon VPN offers subscription services. Subscribers can unlock all servers and enjoy faster connection speeds.
Subscription users have no connection time limits and can experience a more stable service.
We do not require mandatory login. You can subscribe or use Melon VPN’s features without logging in.
We provide a login option, which is supported exclusively through Apple Login (Sign in with Apple).
By logging in, you can enjoy membership services on up to two iOS devices simultaneously.
Subscription and login data are used solely to verify user permissions. We do not collect personal information unrelated to these features.
4. Legal and Rights
Our company is registered in Singapore and complies with local data protection laws.
We comply with GDPR requirements to protect users’ data rights.
We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 and prohibit their use of our services.
5. Data Management
You can access, correct, or delete your information at any time.
We retain data only when necessary and delete or anonymize it when no longer needed.
6. Technical Implementation
Our VPN service uses the NEVPNManager API, which meets Apple’s technical requirements.
Network Speed Test:
The speed test feature collects only the data necessary for network performance testing and does not involve personal data.
Browser Feature:
The built-in browser adheres to privacy protection standards, and all data is handled anonymously and non-permanently.
7. Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of our services indicates your acceptance of the updates.
For significant changes, we will notify you through the app, email, or other means.
