If you use Facebook we additionally receive and add to the records:
Facebook ID (to communicate with Facebook server)
Facebook profile picture (avatar)
In the “Personal data” the name and last name are added through Facebook. These form your username automatically for you. So when you register by using Facebook it automatically generates your username for you. When creating a account by email and password these are not needed.
The “Formula data” is for our formula to calculate the calories burnt. You can leave these to the standard values, the app will work but the formula won’t work.
The “Account data” forms the account for you.
The avatar is an extra for your profile, you can leave this blank.
The Achievements are stored automatically so we can load the digital medals you earned.
The Email, Username and Password will give you access to your online profile. When losing your login data you can use your email address to reset the information.
All passwords are encrypted. We can’t read this.
The “Phone and activity” Data is what fill your account and what helps us to run our support.
We use the UDID to determine if the account is still on the right device. If it switches to much it will freeze the account for safety measures.
The login date helps the support to retrieve account and detect strange account behaviour.
Your purchases (The older schedules/pro run options and now the subscriptions) are added to your account. This is because when you switch phones we still want you to be able to use your purchases.
Trial data will make sure that you receive the 7 days of free use of every paid feature. This allows us to track those 7 days.
The Version ID shows what version of the app is last seen on your phone. Often we can help people by letting them know they need to update the app on their device.
The Location History / Session data is what makes up the statistics. We need to keep track of your location data to determine how fast you ran and at what pace. We save the type of training, speed, distance, time, calories and date.
Data Retention
We keep your records. We have a lot of returning runners, sometimes 4-5 years after last running and they have there previous data and purchases ready for them when they decide to pick up the sport again with Run Trainer.
