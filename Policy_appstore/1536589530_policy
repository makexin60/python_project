ADVERTISEMENTS
Advertisements appearing on the Website may be delivered by us or one or more third-party web advertisers. These third party web advertisers may set cookies. These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your computer by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers. For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third- party web advertiser(s).
OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
Under certain circumstances, Chef’s Plate will disclose your personal information:
when we are required or authorized by law to do so, for example if a court issues a subpoena;
when you have consented to the disclosure;
where it is necessary to establish or collect fees;
if we engage a third party to provide IT services to us (like computer back-up services or archival file storage) and the third party is bound by our privacy policy, please note that such service provider(s) may be located outside of Canada;
in connection with a change of control transaction;
if the information is already publicly known.
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate or provide the Service on our behalf (for example delivery and production facilities), to process payment, provide customer support, provide postal code information to our delivery drivers, to host our job application form, to perform Website-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Website's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually bound not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Our service providers store information in Canada and in the United States and accordingly your personal information may be available to Canadian and/or United States governments or agencies under a lawful order, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your personal information.
Chefs Plate will disclose your personal information to the extent that this is legally required, or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and legal process; or in the event of an emergency pertaining to your health and/or safety.
YOUR RIGHTS

You may also amend your personal details using your Chefs Plate account on the Website or the App.
RETENTION
Unless specified otherwise in this Privacy Policy, we will retain your information until you cancel your Chef’s Plate account, or until your Chef’s Plate account has been inactive for a year. If you wish to cancel your Chef’s Plate account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please contact us at hello@chefsplate.com. Upon expiry of the one year period of inactivity, we will alert you and give you two weeks to re-activate your Chef’s Plate account or retrieve any personal information you want to keep.

SECURITY
Chefs Plate has taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures against loss or unlawful processing of your personal data. We use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) as well as physical safeguards of the locations where data are stored.
However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Any transmission of information by you to Chef’s Plate is at your own risk. We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.
