​Privacy Policy
​
Effective Date: 9/12/2024
At Glasseye ("we," "us," or "our"), we are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the data when you use our augmented reality (AR) app, which integrates ARCore (for Android) or ARKit (for iOS), accesses your camera, and includes an internal browser with limited functionality.
​
By using our app, you agree to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. Please read this policy carefully to understand how we handle your data.
​
1. Information We Do Not Collect
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data or identifiable information when you use our app. We do not track or collect any data such as your name, email, location, or browsing history.
2. Camera Access
Our app requires access to your device’s camera in order to provide the augmented reality (AR) features. However, we do not capture, store, or transmit any images or videos taken with the camera. The camera is used exclusively to render AR experiences in real-time, and no data from the camera is collected or stored by us.
3. Use of ARCore and ARKit
The app uses ARCore (for Android) and ARKit (for iOS) technologies to provide AR features. These frameworks utilize your device’s sensors and camera to detect and track the environment in real-time. However, we do not access or store any personal data processed by ARCore or ARKit outside the context of the AR experience. The data captured by these frameworks is processed locally on your device and is not shared with us.
4. Internal Browser
Our app includes an internal browser that allows you to view web content. However, you cannot input or enter your own URLs in the internal browser. The browser is restricted to pre-configured web pages and URLs that are part of the app's functionality. This means no user-generated data or browsing history is collected from the internal browser.
5. Data Storage and Sharing
As we do not collect personal information, we do not store, share, or sell any user data. The app does not process, transmit, or collect any personal information or identifiable data.
6. Third-Party Services
While we do not collect personal data, our app may contain third-party services that collect information independently, such as analytics or advertisements. These services may collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties to understand how they manage your data.
7. Permissions
To provide the AR experience and internal browser functionality, the app requires the following permissions:
Camera Access:
To capture real-time images for AR features.
Internet Access:
To display pre-configured web pages in the internal browser.
You can manage or revoke these permissions through your device’s settings at any time. However, disabling these permissions may affect the functionality of the app.
8. Security
We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, but as we do not collect any personal information, there is no personal data at risk. We ensure that any information processed is done so securely and in accordance with best practices.
9. Children's Privacy
Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have unintentionally collected data from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.
10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any significant changes are made, we will notify you through the app or by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We recommend that you review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
