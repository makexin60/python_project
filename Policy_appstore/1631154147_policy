This list of Booking Engines is subject to change and any additions or deletions will be reflected in an updated version of this Policy.
These Booking Engines will provide the Reservation Information to both us and/or to the independent operators and/or managers of the Hard Rock Hotels to complete your reservation and to provide you services.  Some of the Reservation Information may also be provided to Hard Rock to verify if a visit occurred and for purposes of tracking loyalty rewards under the Hard Rock Rewards Program.
The Booking Engines are contracted to collect and provide the Reservation Information to us and the independent owners and/or operators of Hard Rock Hotels for purposes of making and managing your reservations at Hard Rock Hotels.  However, they are separately owned and operated from Hard Rock, and therefore this Privacy Policy does not pertain to the policies and practices of such Booking Engines.  Please consult the privacy policies listed above regarding their policies and practices with respect to the Personal Information they collect and process in providing these reservation services.
HARD ROCK MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES REGARDING SUCH BOOKING ENGINES OR THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY OR PRIVACY PRACTICES.  PLEASE NOTE THAT HARD ROCK DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY RELATING TO USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (INCLUDING RESERVATION INFORMATION) BY THE BOOKING ENGINES OR THE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OF THE FRANCHISED HOTELS THAT ARE NOT OWNED, MANAGED OR OPERATED BY HARD ROCK.
RIGHT NOT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION
In certain jurisdictions, you may have the right not to provide Personal Information. However, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to utilize certain services on the Website, including making reservations online.
JOB POSTINGS
The Website may include job postings from time to time for various Hard Rock Hotel properties or our corporate offices. You may be given the opportunity to apply for job openings online through an applicant tracking system operated by iCIMS by creating an account and submitting an application via the Website, which is usually received by the human resources department of the hiring company (which may be Hard Rock or a Hard Rock affiliate or an independent entity). If submitted through that tracking system, your resume or CV and other Personal Information (collectively, “
Job Posting Information
”) will be made available to the owner, operator or manager of the Hard Rock Hotel or Hard Rock office to which you are applying (which could be a different company from Hard Rock).  In addition, your Job Posting Information will be stored in that tracking system in an electronic database maintained by iCIMS in the United States on behalf of Hard Rock and the operators, owners and managers of Hard Rock Hotels. If you have any questions about those practices, please contact iCIMS directly at
www.icims.com
. You must contact iCIMS directly to access, correct, amend or delete any Job Posting Information you may have submitted through their tracking system.
In some cases, the Website might list the email address of a contact person at the applicable hiring company.  If that hiring company is Hard Rock or a Hard Rock affiliate, any Job Posting Information sent to that email address will be maintained in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If that email address is for an independent entity that owns, manages or operates that Hard Rock Hotel, then it will be maintained in accordance with their information practices. All such Job Posting Information may be used by the applicable hiring company for the purpose of assessing your suitability for current and future job vacancies and to pursue your recruiting process.
HARD ROCK MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY OR PRIVACY PRACTICES. PLEASE NOTE THAT HARD ROCK DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILTY RELATING TO USE OF YOUR JOB POSTING OR OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION (INCLUDING RESUMES AND CVs) BY iCIMS AND BY ANY INDEPENDENT OWNER, MANAGER OR OPERATOR OF A HARD ROCK HOTEL.
You will also be required to create an account with a user name and password when using an applicant tracking system. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of that username and password, and for any unauthorized access or use of your user name and password, except where due to the negligence or other fault of Hard Rock.
If at any time you want your Personal Information, resume or CV to be deleted, you simply need to notify the hiring Hard Rock Hotel operator or management company, and in the case of information submitted through the iCIMS tracking system to an independent owner, manager, or operator of a Hard Rock location, you should notify the independent owner, manager, or operator of a Hard Rock location. You may also contact iCIMS directly as stated in the iCIMS privacy policy.
COOKIES
Some information that we collect about you is collected passively through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small files of information, which save and retrieve information about your visit to the Website — for example, how you entered and navigated our Website, and what information was of interest to you. We use this information to remember you when you return and to customize our Website to your preferences. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies. However, you may find that some parts of the Website will not function properly if cookies are refused. We also allow certain third party advertisers and partners to collect Personal Information about your use of the Website through first and third-party cookies in order to serve adverts to you. They may also analyze this Personal Information in order to serve adverts to you on other third-party websites.
DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in the Cookies section (e.g., by disabling cookies). Please note that Hard Rock does not collect, and is not aware of third parties that collect, from users of the Website personal information about users’ online activities across third party websites.
CLEAR GIFS, PIXEL TAGS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Website usage. You may view and change your preferences at any time by using the ‘Privacy Settings’ link found in the footer of our website. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS/TRACKING
We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Website. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our services. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties.
AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING AND PROFILING
Automated Decision Making refers to a decision which is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your personal data. This means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not require human intervention.  As Profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making.  Hard Rock does not use any automated decision making or profiling in its business processes.
ACCESS, CORRECTION, AND CHOICE
You have choices about the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information, including:
Deletion: You can request that we erase or delete all or some of your Personal Information (e.g., it is no longer necessary to provide services to you).
