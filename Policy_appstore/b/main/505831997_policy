WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information")

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control,
including but not limited to third party websites, services and applications ("Third
Party Services") that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or
employ. While we may attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect

Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you

The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In
connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your

Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of
visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in
a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties
authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and
improve them.
EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS:
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve
our customer service.

Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you

use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the
Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.
Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general
information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted,
however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing
you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you
leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the
Services.
This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party
websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.
AGGREGATE INFORMATION:
We collect statistical information about how users use the Services ("Aggregate Information"). This
statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.
HOW, AND WITH WHOM, IS MY INFORMATION SHARED?
Some of the information generated through the Services may be shared publicly or with third parties.
YOUR ACTIVITY ON THE SERVICES:
Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not
limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services.
Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of
the Services, then that information may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may
use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and
search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any
specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit
through the Services.
IP ADDRESS INFORMATION:
While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times,
however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we
conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION YOU ELECT TO SHARE:
You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to
those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or
practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those
Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the
Services.
AGGREGATE INFORMATION:
We may share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom
we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and
how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their
services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us
non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently
developed or acquired.
EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS WITH US:
As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us.
INFORMATION SHARED WITH OUR AGENTS:
We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf
and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our
Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not
have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is
necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
INFORMATION DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO BUSINESS TRANSFERS:
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is
typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
INFORMATION DISCLOSED FOR OUR PROTECTION AND THE PROTECTION OF OTHERS:
We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably
believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental
request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii)
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support
requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware
prevention.
INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH YOUR CONSENT:
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third
parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING MY INFORMATION?
You can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of
information that we collect.
You can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take
advantage of some of our features.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the
Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect
or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services. A user is bound by
any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first
posted.
