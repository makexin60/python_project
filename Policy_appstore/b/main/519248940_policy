4. Our legal basis for using personal information
The NPIS and UKTIS consider that performance of our tasks and functions are in the public interest. So when using personal information our legal basis is usually that its use is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of official authority vested in us. In some situations we may rely on a different legal basis; for example, when we are using personal information to pay a supplier, our legal basis is that its use is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a buyer of goods and services.
When we are using more sensitive types of personal information, including health information, our legal basis is usually that the use is necessary:
for the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services; or
for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; or
for reasons of substantial public interest for aims that are proportionate and respect people's rights, for example research; or
in order to protect the vital interests of an individual; or
for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or in the case of a court order
5. Who provides the personal information
When you do not provide information directly to us, we receive it from other individuals and organisations involved in the delivery of health and care services in the UK and Republic of Ireland. These include other NHS organisations and primary care contractors such as GPs, dentists, pharmacists and opticians; other public bodies, e.g. Local Authorities and suppliers of goods and services.
6. Sharing personal information with others
Depending on the situation, where necessary we will share appropriate, relevant and proportionate personal information in compliance with the law, with the following:
healthcare professionals
patients and their chosen representatives or carers
staff
healthcare social and welfare organisations
suppliers
service providers
legal representatives
auditors and audit bodies
research organisations
people making an enquiry or complaint
7. Transferring personal information abroad
No personal information is transferred abroad.
8. Retention periods of the information we hold
NPIS Birmingham, NPIS Cardiff, NPIS Newcastle (including UKTIS) The
Records Management Code of Practice

detailing the minimum retention period for the information and procedures for the safe disposal of personal information.
