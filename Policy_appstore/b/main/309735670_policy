The Scope of Indeed’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers data that we collect through the Sites, directly from data subjects, or that we obtain from third parties. In cases where you follow a link to a third-party website, you are no longer covered by our Privacy Policy, and any data collection or processing activity that takes place on that website will be governed by that website’s own privacy policy. We only collect data on the Sites that display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.
In accordance with our Terms, the Site is generally only for use by people aged 16 or over. However, some jurisdictions have different age restrictions, as outlined below.
Japan:  For users in Japan, the Site is only for use by those who meet the permitted minimum age under Japanese law for Indeed to lawfully provide you with use of the Site.
EEA, Switzerland, UK, Turkey, and Ukraine:  As of 1 February 2024, access to the Site in the EEA, as well as Switzerland, UK, Turkey, and Ukraine, is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older.
In all jurisdictions, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use the Sites under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian, or responsible adult even if your age is above the Indeed permitted use age for that jurisdiction.
We adopt a range of measures to try to ensure that no information is knowingly solicited from individuals who do not meet the minimum age or any other applicable age requirements.
If we learn that an individual who does not meet the minimum age requirement has used the Site or provided personal information through the Site, we will restrict access to, or close their account, and remove that information from our systems.
Applicants to internal jobs at Indeed should reference the
Recruitment Privacy Policy
.
Current and former employees of Indeed should reach out to their Human Resources partner to reference the Global Employee Privacy Notice.
Data collection and use
Learn about the types of data Indeed uses to support the services we provide.
Indeed uses different types of information in order to provide our Sites’ services, products, and features to you.  The Personal Data we collect and process may vary, depending on how you use our Sites.
If Personal Data is required, to provide particular Indeed services or features to you, it will be indicated at the time of collection. If Personal Data is required and you choose not to provide it, then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.
Information that Indeed collects
In accordance with applicable data protection laws in the EEA, controllers must have a legal basis to process information. This means we rely on different legal bases to process your information, depending on the purpose of processing outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Full details of the types of personal data we collect from you, the purpose of processing it, our processing operations, and details of the legal bases we rely upon for GDPR are detailed below.
Retention of Your Information
Where Indeed acts as a controller of your Personal Data, we retain such data until it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose it is being used for, as required by applicable laws,  or until you ask us to delete it.
Information on how long we retain your information, for each purpose, is set out in the following section. In determining these appropriate retention periods, we consider the purposes for which we process Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We also consider the extent, nature, and sensitivity of Personal Data and our legal obligations with respect to data. Where possible and relying on our legitimate interest in improving our Sites, Indeed anonymizes or aggregates Personal Data, so that it can no longer be associated with or identify a user, in which case Indeed can further process the information. For example, we may use anonymized job seeker data, such as your profile data to test the accuracy of our products and services. Another way we may use anonymized data is to make sure our technology is helping all people get jobs in a way that is fair.
Where Indeed acts as Processor of your Personal Data, we store such data until instructed to delete it by the Controller.

Additional Purposes and Disclosures of Information
Profile data
By creating a searchable profile through the Site including when you upload a file resume on the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your profile data to third parties, in accordance with our
Indeed General Terms of Service
. When you create a profile on Indeed, it is set to searchable by default. This means that profile data (searchable) including your resume data, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers.
Please note Employers and Employer representatives who access your profile data while it is set to searchable visibility, or to whom you apply with your not searchable profile, may choose to share your profile with additional parties. Indeed is not responsible for such sharing. Similarly, when you share your searchable profile directly with a personalized link, we cannot control who sees your profile when you share that link.
You may change your profile privacy settings at any time. If you do not want Indeed to make your profile data (searchable) available to third parties without your direction or if you do not want Employers to contact you, you can set your profile to not searchable. If you would like to learn more about your profile, including the differences between searchable and not searchable private profile and how to change your profile privacy settings please see our
FAQ
.
Please note that as we continue to improve the Site, you may see phrases like ‘Employers can find you’ and ‘Employers can’t find you’. These phrases are to enhance user understanding and are synonymous with the terms ‘Searchable’ and ‘Not Searchable’ respectively.
Employer Accounts
We offer users the ability to link Employer accounts together. Linked users can be assigned specific roles, which provide varying levels of access to the candidate Personal Data contained in the parent account. If you are an Employer and you invite other Indeed users to link their accounts to yours, you agree that such linked users may have access to any and all information in your account. Types of candidate Personal Data include resume contacts, application materials and statuses, communications with applicants, any action taken by you or another user linked to the account, when you took that action, and billing information within the account. When an Employer account is delinked, either by your own action or an administrator’s action, you will lose access to all candidate Personal Data in the linked account.
Resume Review Services
In certain markets, we may also offer additional resume review services to help Job Seekers build and improve their resumes. For example, this can include helping you understand how your resume may be parsed by applicant tracking system software, feedback on ways to build a more effective resume, or a personalized resume review video. In providing these services, Indeed may give you feedback, including questions and comments on the contents of your resume, about Your Resume or other materials you submit through the services. We provide this feedback directly to you, and may give you the ability to access it within your account. It is not made available to Employers.
Automated Processing of Your Personal Data
We perform automated processing of Personal Data to evaluate specific aspects relating to a user and to analyze and predict a user’s preferences and interests. Where we perform this processing, we do so either on the basis of user consent or performance of a contract, whereby such processing is necessary for us to provide our services to Job Seekers and Employers. For example, such processing allows us to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, to provide Job Seekers with Job Alerts, recommended jobs, and invitations to take action on jobs that the Job Seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular Job Seeker applications to an Employer, to display search results, to send application status notifications on behalf of Employers, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users. Such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of our users. You may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to exercise your rights or contest any decision generated by said automated processing.
How we use Artificial Intelligence or “AI”
Indeed’s mission is to help people get jobs. To achieve this, job seekers and employers must be able to easily and quickly find one another and be equipped with information that may be helpful in understanding if a job seeker and employer are a good match. In support of these goals, we use personal data to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence (“
AI
”), to improve some of our products.
We use AI to provide candidate highlights which is a summary of your information, personalize outreach messages for employers, and offer job-based matched candidates. We use your personal data, including profile information and activity data to provide matched candidates, which is powered by Indeed. AI-generated outreach messages and candidate highlights leverage our partnership with vendors acting on our behalf. These AI features help job seekers and employers connect over potential employment opportunities.
Indeed may in some jurisdictions enable chatbots, which allow you to take certain actions on the Site, such as applying to a job, scheduling an interview, or otherwise interacting with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“
Chatbot
”). We use the information you share in a chat with a Chatbot to provide more personalized responses or relevant information in that conversation, when you are seeking to take certain actions on the Site such as applying to a job, scheduling an interview, or otherwise interacting with the Site. If you use Indeed Coworker, a Chatbot whose responses are powered by our vendor, will be processed by Indeed and the vendor.
Our AI capabilities are continuously evolving as we innovate to provide personalized experiences, return relevant search results, and improve matches. These advancements aim to make the job search and hiring process faster and simpler. Indeed is committed to investing in these areas and will continue to develop and deploy solutions to achieve these goals, ultimately making it easier for job seekers to find jobs and for employers to find the right candidates.You can find more details on
Indeed’s AI Principles
and Responsible AI at Indeed within our ESG hub. We’ll continue to build on these efforts and integrate additional privacy safeguards as we improve our generative AI technologies.

Transfers of Information to Job Seekers
Indeed sends certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers. This includes publishing Job Ads, Company Pages, and salary information on the Sites and publishing Job Listings on third-party websites. Indeed may also make available certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers, such as information about an Employer’s activity and responsiveness on the Sites. This can include the Employer representative’s name, the Employer’s city/state location, whether the Employer has taken or has chosen not to take an action with regard to the Job Seeker’s resume or application such as opening, viewing, responding to or making a decision in regard to it, whether the Employer has engaged with other Job Seekers or viewed other Job Seekers’ resumes, and whether the Employer has taken an action in regard to a Job Listing such as pausing or closing it. We do this in order to help Job Seekers evaluate employment opportunities. As an Employer, when you use the Sites (for example by posting a Job Listing or contacting a Job Seeker through the Indeed Resume Program) you agree that Indeed may provide this information to Job Seekers.
Transfers of Information to Service Providers and other third parties
We use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Sites and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize our services and our users’ experiences. By using our Sites, you acknowledge Indeed’s use of such third-parties, including, but not limited to, for the purpose of collecting, processing, analyzing, and recording your activity on, interaction with, and communications with, or through our Sites.

Indeed will not sell or rent data collected from the Indeed Interview Updates or Recruiter Invitations short code programs to third parties for marketing purposes.
Transfer of information to partners
In certain markets, Indeed works with partners who are involved in helping Job Seekers find opportunities. These partnerships introduce Job Seekers to Indeed and our services. These types of partnerships help Indeed understand the needs of Job Seekers in diverse audiences and how we can improve our services for diverse audiences. In some instances, Indeed shares limited information back to our partners about Job Seekers. For example,  confirmation that a Job Seeker has created an Indeed account or used one of our Sites successfully (for example, by applying to a certain number of jobs or utilizing our career guides). We strive to help all Job Seekers find jobs but we are primarily a website, so these partnerships help us reach audiences that may not come to Indeed through regular internet use. These partners may advertise their career services in partnership with Indeed. For the avoidance of doubt, where partners are co-branded on the site, each entity is a separate controller of your Personal Data.
Transfers of Publicly Available Information
When users post content on the Sites in a manner that is intended to make that content searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties. For example, if an Employer posts a job on the Sites, Indeed may share that Job Listing or information contained within that Job Listing with third parties, at Indeed’s discretion and subject to agreement with such third parties. Indeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.
Transfers of information from service providers
Indeed may collect and use information about users obtained from third-party platforms such as social networking sites for the following purposes:
To classify and quantitatively understand the number of responses and spread of marketing campaign measures such as TV commercials;
To monitor the reputation of Indeed’s services to understand what is appreciated and what is not, and use this information in communication plans;
For early detection of improvements to the service, monitoring of user feedback, and planning of countermeasures;
To provide support for users who do not know how to use Indeed’s services;
To find product defects (e.g., “When I try to open the application, it displays a 501 error and I can’t use it” or “I can’t apply for a job”) and escalate the issue to the development team
Links to Third-Party Sites
The Sites may make available links to other third-party websites. When you click on such links, you may leave our Sites. Your web browser may also disclose to the third-party website the URL of the Sites page you clicked from, and this URL may include search terms and filters you used on the Sites. The Sites may also make available Company Pages, which may contain information provided by third-party Employers.
Indeed is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Please consult their individual privacy policies to learn more.

This Cookie Policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Sites. Cookies are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment.

A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Certain cookies will be used on the Sites regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.
Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Sites. Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
