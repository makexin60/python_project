Collection and Use of Personal Information
1.1 Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. Smudge collects personal information about customers and prospective customers which is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of its functions or activities. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.
‍
1.2 By browsing
megaphone.smudge.com
or by downloading Megaphone from the App Store, you are not required to reveal any personal information about yourself to Smudge. Once you contact us through our website(s) by providing your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us.
‍
1.3 If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. If you contact us through the contact form on our website(s), we will collect your first and last name, email address and mobile phone number. We may use this information to contact you, if appropriate.

1.4 Megaphone features personalised third-party advertising. By including advertising, we are able to offer certain features free of charge to users. The personalised advertising within Megaphone is served through Google’s AdMob advertising platform. In order to activate Google AdMob advertising, we embed a third-party software development kit (SDK) that is provided by Google. When using Megaphone, your data remains anonymous to us. However, the Google Mobile Ads SDK collects data from your device in order to serve you more relevant ads. This data may include your language, time setting, location, IP address, your device’s operating system details, the third-party apps you have installed on your device, and other technical and statistical information.
‍
For more information about the data collected by Google through its AdMob SDK, and how this data is used, visit the
Google Privacy Policy
. To turn off Google ad personalisation, visit Google’s
Ad Settings page
. You can limit targeted in-app advertising by accessing the privacy settings on your device and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (Apple iOS) or “Opt-out of Interest-Based Ads” (Android). You can also reset your Advertising Identifier (IDFA) from within the privacy settings on your device. An IDFA is a unique identifier assigned to each mobile device that can be used by advertisers to create a profile about you. Opting out of receiving targeted ads or resetting your IDFA may not decrease the number of ads you receive; however, the ads may be less relevant to you, since they will be based on more general targeting criteria.

1.5 Megaphone uses Google Analytics for Firebase. Google Analytics for Firebase is an app measurement solution that provides insights on app usage and user engagement. In order to activate Google Analytics for Firebase within Megaphone, we embed a third-party software development kit (SDK) that is provided by Google. The Firebase SDK collects information from your device in order to help us make informed decisions regarding app marketing and performance optimisation. This information may include your IP address, how often an app is opened, your device’s operating system details, and other technical and statistical information. Google Firebase Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information. Nor do we combine the information collected through Google Firebase Analytics with any personally identifiable information. We use the information we get from Google Firebase Analytics only to improve the app. For more information about the data collected by Google through its Firebase SDK, and how this data is used, visit the
Google Privacy Policy
. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics for Firebase is restricted by the
Google Analytics for Firebase Terms of Service

1.6 Megaphone uses Crashlytics by Fabric. Crashlytics provides information about crashes and malfunctions within the app, to help us identify bugs and other issues that may impair the user experience. In the event of malfunction or failure, certain information is transmitted to Crashlytics. This information may include your IP address, your device’s operating system details, your device ID, model and device type, the version of the application currently running, and the time of malfunction or failure. Crashlytics does not collect any personally identifiable information. Nor do we combine the information collected through Crashlytics with any personally identifiable information.
