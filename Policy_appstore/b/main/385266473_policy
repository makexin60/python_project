Introduction
By participating in the Nectar programme in the United Kingdom (the “Programme”), we will collect and use personal data about you and any additional collectors within your account. Companies participate in the Programme by offering Nectar points (“Points”) or a place to redeem them (we call these companies “Nectar Partners”). Through participating in the Programme we will learn about what you buy, and you may receive offers and marketing from Nectar Partners, the companies whose products they sell or advertise (“Brands”) and other third parties through various Marketing Channels (by this we mean ways of receiving advertising or offers, including email, post, SMS, our Nectar app and Nectar Connect, and may include other digital channels such as websites, apps, social media and advanced TV).
This privacy policy explains what personal data we collect, the way we use it and why, the circumstances when we may share it, and your choices and rights with respect to your personal data.
What personal data do we use?
Personal data you share with us
Account Information
This is personal data such as your name, home address, email, and telephone number that you share with us when you create your Nectar account.
Transaction Information
When you shop with our Nectar Partners and use your Nectar card, e.g. when you swipe your card or buy something on an account you’ve linked with Nectar, we receive personal data about that transaction. This can include details about the transaction such as what you purchased and where you purchased it. If you use Nectar Connect, you also share transactions and transaction history related to the payment card you signed up with, you can find out more about Nectar Connect by visiting
https://www.nectar.com/about/privacy-and-legal/nectar-connect
.
Programme Analytics
This is personal data regarding how you interact with the Programme. This includes:
which offers you engage with and use
the Points redemptions you make
how you interact with and experience our websites and apps
predictions about your interests, shopping habits and characteristics – we call these “profiled characteristics”
Surveys and Market Research
This is personal data that you share with us when you take part in surveys, questionnaires or market research run by us, our Nectar Partners, or research partners.
Contact Centre Information
This is the contents of chats, calls and correspondence with our Contact Centre or with our chatbot on the Nectar website, and any associated data.
Competitions Data
When you enter competitions operated by Nectar or our Nectar Partners, you may share personal data with us, such as your entry, contact and delivery details.
Device information, cookies & similar technologies
This is personal data from devices you use to access the internet, including our services such as our websites and apps, received via e.g. cookies and other similar technologies such as pixels. This could be information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, unique IDs such as advertising IDs, location data, information about your browser, or details contained in URLs used in our communications with you (e.g. offer links in emails).
Cookies are small data files that websites or apps place on your device. To find out more about cookies and similar technologies, please visit our

Additional personal data we receive about you
Data from Nectar Partners and Brands
Nectar Partners and Brands may share personal data with us (e.g. when you link your account) which they have collected during their relationship with you. This may be information such as how you use their website and apps, your transactions with them, competitions, surveys and marketing you’ve responded to, other loyalty schemes you’ve engaged in, or profiled characteristics attributed to you from your interactions with that company.
Data from third party data companies
This is personal data that we receive or use provided by companies that provide customer information or that is publicly available. These might be companies that help us verify or update your address, or companies that provide us with information on your modelled household profile. This could be received at an individual or an anonymous level such as information based on your post code (e.g. Experian, CACI, Royal Mail).
Social Media and Digital Advertising
–
If we market to you using social media or digital advertising platforms (e.g. Google or Facebook), we may use segmentations available on those platforms to help make our marketing more relevant to you.
Anonymous data
When personal data has identifying details removed, that information can become anonymous. This can happen if we remove details such as names and addresses, or aggregate personal data into groups and keep only the information about the groups (e.g. information about people at a post code level or a report of shopping behaviour broken down by age), or when we create models from personal data that identify certain characteristics associated with certain traits (e.g. customers likelihood to buy a particular product or category).
Because we can’t identify people within anonymous data, it is treated differently from personal data and is not covered by this policy.
Pseudonymised data
Pseudonymised data is similar but slightly different from anonymous data. Although identifying details such as names and addresses are removed, it is possible to identify them by reference to a ‘key’ held separately. Pseudonymised data may be used to enhance security and privacy by enabling data to be processed at an individual level without requiring identifying details to do so. Pseudonymised data remains personal data and is covered by this policy.

How we will use your personal data, and our basis for doing so
This section explains when we process your personal data, and why we do it. In these use cases, we may use an automated decision-making process which takes into account the types of data listed in each section. For example, when using automated decision-making processes to market to you based on your Nectar profile, we might take into account Transaction Information, Account Information and Programme Analytics.
In some cases, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effects for you or affects you in a similarly significant way.
If you are seeking to exercise this right, please contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below.

Create data models
We combine the personal data we have and analyse it to look for patterns, trends and characteristics that align with a particular outcome – for example, items that are often purchased together, or popular times to redeem points. We use this analysis to create a framework that maps out these patterns, trends and characteristics on an anonymous basis - we call these frameworks “data models” and the process of making them “data modelling”.
Data modelling helps us to analyse the way that groups of people are shopping. For instance, we might look at Transaction Information at Sainsbury’s and see that buyers of ground coffee are starting to buy coffee beans or pods instead - which could be useful information for Nectar Partners who sell coffee machines.
We can then apply data models to a personalised data set, to help us tailor the offers that we show Nectar collectors. For example, sending coffee machine offers to buyers of instant coffee.
In some circumstances we also share personal data with Nectar Partners to enable them to create their own models. Please see the “Who will we share your personal data with?” section for further details.

We also share personal data with Sainsbury’s Bank and Argos financial services (see Who are we? section of
https://privacy-hub.sainsburys.co.uk/privacy-policy
)
(referred to collectively in this policy as ‘Sainsbury’s Bank’) to enable them to create data models designed to indicate a shopper’s credit worthiness and insurance risk. Sainsbury’s Bank creates those models by combining datasets of Transaction Information at Sainsbury’s, Argos, Habitat and Tu with datasets such as credit worthiness and credit performance data or insurance performance data. They apply the data models they create to personal data we share with them to offer Nectar collectors a more convenient product (such as pre-approval for credit) or, with your consent, to give you a better deal on a financial product such as credit or insurance.
From time to time we may also enter partnerships which mean that we share more data than is set out above. In those circumstances you will be presented with clear additional information at the point that you choose to link your account. You can find that information by visiting the relevant Nectar Partner’s page within the Nectar app or website.
