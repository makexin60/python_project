International Users and GDPR regulations
Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. PostureCo, Inc. abides by the "safe harbor" frameworks set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected by organizations in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.  Specific GDPR regulation questions are addressed below.
The PostureScreen, LeanScreen and SquatScreen apps do not require PII data of the app user. The user may enter non-PII data (business address, clinic name) which is stored on the device itself. The user may enter their own name (Dr. Mary Smith) to be used in outgoing email communications and customized reports which is stored on the device itself. Security, access, addition, removal, and monitoring of the data is the responsibility of the device owner.
The PostureScreen, LeanScreen and SquatScreen apps collect PII data of the user's clients. This data is entered into the apps by the user for the purpose of performing health screenings of the client. This client PII data is stored on the device itself. Security, access, addition, removal, and monitoring of the data is the responsibility of the device owner, which includes arrangements the owner has made with each individual client.
If the user connects to the SyncScreen service the app will store client PII data onto the PostureCo controlled storage systems. The storage systems are hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the USA only, transmitted with end to end encryption. Cloud storage happens automatically once the user has signed into the SyncScreen storage service.  In addition to using GDPR and HIPAA compliant storage systems, PostureCoâ€™s technology:
provides comprehensive data management to the device user: the user can add, review, modify, and remove all of the PII data through the existing tools within the PostureScreen app, which specifically includes complete deletion from both the user's device and the PostureCo controlled storage systems;
controls access with "fine grain" segmented storage: each SyncScreen storage location is segmented apart from other storage accounts;
controls access with API-request authentication: each SyncScreen account user must authenticate with the PostureCo APIs before reading or writing to the storage locations;
controls access by using temporary access tokens: each authenticated session is valid for a limited time and cannot be reused after the temporary token has expired;
ensures encryption of the data at rest with an AES symmetric block cipher;
ensures encryption of data in transit with TLS/SSL communications;
no third parties have access to the data;
PostureCo business processes allow only a limited number of senior-level PostureCo technology staff access to the storage systems, for the purposes of technology maintenance.
Finally, non-PII data is always stored on the PostureCo controlled analytics system, hosted by Google Cloud Platform which is GDPR compliant. This analytics data includes aggregate human body measurements (range of motion angles, postural translations) but does not contain PII data (name, address, government ID numbers).
If you are a patient or client of a healthcare or other professional who is using our services, you must contact them directly and ask for your record information and or deletion.  Given many laws in place with HIPAA, records can not be deleted by PostureCo, Inc as they must be retained by health care providers even when you opt out of their care/services.  You can, however ask they delete your electronic records themselves with our company and ask they keep a "paper file" for future records requests common within the healthcare landscape.  It is the sole responsibility of the healthcare professional/fitness professional that is utilizing our services to maintain and comply with your requests on your personal electronic records.  PostureCo, Inc. does not have patient/client level access to your files if stored within our SyncScreen cloud services, only the provider that placed them there has this "key" to your records.
Commitment to Your Privacy
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to PostureCo, Inc. employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
