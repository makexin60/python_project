If you voluntarily contact us for support or other inquiries, you may be required to provide us with certain information such as your name and email address. We will use this data to provide you with the support you requested or to respond to your inquiry. Our lawful basis is our legitimate interest unless you are a User seeking technical support, in which this would be part of our contract obligation to you.
Call Log –
only if you use our
Caller ID App
you will need to accept the
"call log"
permission. We use this permission to identify your callers, including if this caller is active in the last 6 months for the purpose of detect spam and fraud, accuracy and making sure the number is actually associated with a caller and is not a bot or otherwise a spammer. Any Android or iOS permissions need to be affirmatively enabled through in-app permission or the mobile settings. You may disable the permissions at any time, but depending on the permission you disable, a feature or all features may not function properly.
Contact List -
In order to provide our Services, you will need to share your full contact list with us and provide with the permissions to access your contact list. The Services include enrichment, management, backup, verification, deletion of duplication of your contact list address book or a caller ID. For this, we will need your contact list.
