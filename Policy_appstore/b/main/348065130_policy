What Are Cookies?
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an
anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's
computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a
part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web
site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only
permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you,
not the cookies sent to you by other sites.  Some of our business
partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies that originate from their
sites. We have no access or control over those cookies.

Information We Collect from Cookies?
As you use our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate
you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent
you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in
more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our
Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of
people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most
popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve
our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us
to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally
store any personal information that you provided to us in your
cookies.

alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain
information to third parties if we have determined that the
information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible
third party. For example, some of our partners operate stores or
provide services on our site, while others power offerings developed
by us for your use. We also use third parties to facilitate our
business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing
credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business
operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to
your personal information for use in connection with business
activities. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or
