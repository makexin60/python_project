This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on my website and apps.
Information I collect
When you visit my website, I store basic technical information. This information includes your browser type, version, and language, your operating system, the referring and exit websites, anonymised IP address, a date/time stamp of the request, and the requested resource (file name and URL). I use this information in anonymised form for statistical analysis, to administer our site, and to improve our product and services, without directly associating this data with individual users.
When using my apps, certain information will be transferred, e.g. your IP address. I also receive data on which device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) you use, and for how long you perform certain actions within the app. With your IP address, I can determine your approximate geographic location (e.g. which country you are currently in).
This data will be anonymized (IP addresses are not retained), and cannot be used to identify a user. This data is collected for statistic analyses. Such analyses help me make my apps more attractive and, if necessary, to improve their functionalities. For example, I can determine which features users prefer to use so I can focus on improving those features, or I can see where my apps contain bugs.
When you contact me I store your email address and a record of your communication with my email hosting and customer support service.
Information usage
I use the information I collect to operate and improve my website, apps and customer support.
I do not share personal information with outside parties.
I may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect my rights and property.
In the future, I may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
Security
I implement security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with my website requires HTTPS.
