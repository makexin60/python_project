Thank you for visiting our website and reviewing our Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy:
We do not ask for or collect personal, individually-identifiable information from kids. If any user chooses to provide us with personal information, as in an email inquiry, that information will be used only to respond to the message. The information will not be used for any purpose other than to respond to the inquiry. We do not create individual profiles from the information provided or distribute the information to other organizations.
If You Identify Yourself by Sending an E-mail:
If you send us personal identifying information by e-mail (for example, in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your requests.
We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.
