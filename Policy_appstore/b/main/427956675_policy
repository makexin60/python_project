The information we collect from you
We collect the information you provide to us when you register on the Platform, including your name, gender, email address and search preferences. We use this information to create a User account for you on our Platform and to provide our services to you, including publishing your adverts on the Platform and facilitating introductions with other Users of our Platform. However, we will not share your email address with other Users of our Platform unless you have specifically chosen to disclose it. Where you have not opted out of receiving them, we will also use this information to send you email notifications of other Users’ adverts matching your search preferences and/or newsletters about our own services we think may be of interest to you from time to time. We will not sell or rent any of this information to any third parties nor send you any third party marketing communications unless you have specifically opted in to receiving them.
Any information you include in any advert you post on our Platform will be collected by us and stored on our servers for the purposes of making the Platform, and the content contained within it, available to our users, and to enable our users to search for and respond to adverts on the Platform.
In the event you are asked to submit any sensitive Personal Information as part of the process for posting adverts on the Platform you’ll be asked to tick a box to demonstrate your consent to our collecting and storing that information and to us making that information available to other users through the Platform.
We may also collect information from adverts posted on the Platform on an aggregated basis for statistical analysis. Some of this data may be used in press releases or shared with third parties on an aggregated basis.  However, no individual will ever be identified from such data. We don’t collect, store or use any Personal Information contained in any such posts for any other purpose not set out in this privacy policy. Please note that any materials or information you post on our Platform will be visible to other users of the Platform. We therefore advise you to be selective about what information you include in your adverts and not to include any information you aren’t happy to be publicly available.
We may collect any information contained in correspondence between you and us. For example, if you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our Platform or any content or services made available through the Platform.
We may also collect and store any information contained in communications between yourself and other Users on the Platform, where such communications have taken place via the messaging system of our Platform. We do not routinely monitor all communications but we may use software to track communications and we reserve the right to monitor them in order to investigate any suspected breach of our terms and conditions, illegal behavior or any other misuse of our service or for any other reasonable reason as determined by us from time to time.
We may also collect certain information about your visits to our Platform and how you use the Platform. This may include your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, number of page views and similar information.

We may use tracking technologies including cookies to collect this information.
In some instances, we may receive some information that you submit to any third party website and/or mobile application you access from a link contained on our Platform, or where you have logged into our Platform using your profile and account details of a third party website and/or mobile application, such as Facebook. Both we and the owner or operator of that third party website/mobile application will be the data controller in respect of any such information. You should check the privacy policy of those third party websites/mobile applications to find out how they will collect, track and use your data, including Personal Information.
If you choose to register and log in to our Platform using your Facebook profile you are agreeing to share some of the information contained in your Facebook profile with us, such as your age, gender, friends list, your education and work history, your email address and your interests. We may use this information to improve your user experience on the Platform and to match you with other users of the Platform who you are already friends with on Facebook, or who have similar interests or histories to you. If at any time you would like to request that the information we have received from Facebook is deleted, then please contact us using the contact details that are set out in section 1.2 above.
We may also receive Personal Information about you from various third parties.

Cookies and other tracking technologies
In common with other websites and mobile applications we use cookies and other tracking technologies to ensure that you get the most out of the site and to improve the service we offer. A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your device when you access a website. The text file is then sent back to the server each time your browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser you are using.
Some cookies we use are necessary for our Platform to function properly and to enable you to move around the Platform and use its features. In addition we also use so called "functional" cookies, which allow our Platform to remember choices you’ve made in relation to the Platform, so as to provide a more personalized and enhanced user experience. Examples of the functional cookies we use on the site, and the information we collect through the use of those cookies, include those that remember details about your account preferences, including your password and login details, your search history and adverts you have posted to the Platform, the types of alerts and newsletters you have opted to receive and the types of adverts you are interested in hearing about.
As mentioned above, we may also use an analytics service provider, such as Google Analytics, for website and mobile application traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about website and mobile application use by means of tracking technologies including cookies that are stored on users' devices. The information generated relating to the Platform may be used to create reports about the use of the Platform - the analytics service provider will store this information.
In addition, we are also using the following types of cookies/tracking technologies on the Platform:
Google AdWords
Using Google AdWords code, we are able to see which pages helped lead to registering and, where applicable, upgrading. This allows us to make better use of our paid search budget on Google. You can also choose to opt-out of AdWords remarketing

DoubleClick
We use Google Analytics remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on the Platform. This allows us to provide targeted advertising in the future when you browse other websites.
Facebook Pixel
We use the Facebook Pixel to understand how people we advertize to on Facebook, and Facebook partners, interact with our site. The Facebook Pixel also allows us to identify groups of Facebook users who are similar to groups of  users of the Platform and advertize our services to them. Guidance on how to opt out is available

Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting
These help us better understand who our users are so we can make content on other channels, such as YouTube, more relevant. You can choose to opt out of these cookies

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. In addition, we may use other technology that is standard to the Internet, such as pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies, to track visitors to the Platform. Those tools may be used by us and by third parties to collect information about you and your internet activity, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal.
Payment information
All payment for any products or services offered through our Platform, including for any adverts or Early Bird access, are made via a secure server provided by our third party payment processors, currently Stripe, WorldPay and Paypal. We will not collect, store or process any credit card or other payment information on our own servers.
Third parties
Third party content, websites, mobile applications, contributors and use of cookies/other tracking technologies.
We use third parties including those identified in Clause 5.4 above, other advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers who may use cookies and/or other tracking technologies to collect information, including your Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. Our Platform may contain content and links to other websites and microsites that are operated by third parties. In addition, advertisements contained on our Platform may operate as links to that advertiser’s website, and such advertisers and third parties may also use and place cookies on your devices.
We do not control, and accept no liability or responsibility for, these third parties, including third party websites, advertisements, mobile applications and tracking technologies including cookies of such third parties. This privacy policy does not apply to such third parties, including third party websites, microsites, advertisements, mobile applications and tracking technologies including cookies. Any information such third parties collect by virtue of you clicking on a third party link on our Platform will be collected and used in accordance with the privacy policy of that third party. Please consult the terms and conditions and privacy policy of those third party websites, mobile applications and microsites to find out how they collect and use your data, including your Personal Information, and to establish whether and for what purpose they use  tracking technologies including cookies.
Security and data retention
We employ appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect against any unauthorized access to or unlawful processing of any Personal Information about you that we hold. We will retain your information for the period as defined in our data retention policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt, save where your account has been closed for a breach, Personal Information associated with any account on our site will be retained for a maximum period of 12 months following an account closure.  We reserve the right to access this data during this period for the purposes of fraud prevention and/or to investigate any complaints we may receive. In cases where a deletion is not possible due to legal, statutory or contractual retention periods, or if it requires disproportionate efforts or prejudices your legitimate interests, the information will be blocked instead of deleted.
Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure. Although we employ appropriate technological and organizational security measures to protect your data, including your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any data sent over the internet.
International data transfers
Our servers are hosted in the U.S., however we collect data from wherever users are situated. The information we collect will therefore be transferred to the US from any other country in which you may be located. Use of the service constitutes consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States.
Changes to our privacy policy
We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy from time to time. Any such changes to our privacy policy will be posted to our Platform and, if we consider it to be appropriate, sent to you by e-mail.
