Contact information; device information and identifier; connection and usage data; demographic and statistical information, including age, date of birth, gender, income and other personal finance information, religion, union or guild membership, and race or ethnicity; interest information including, health and wellness information, lifestyle information, hobbies, product ownership, purchase history or intentions; user-generated content; geolocation; and social media information.
