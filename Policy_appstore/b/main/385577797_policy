App Won’t Open or Crashes When Opening
Sometimes, on older devices, “location services” on your iPhone prevents the app from unzipping its database. This occurs only the first time you load the app. Here’s an easy fix:
Disable location services for the app: Go to the iPhone Settings > Privacy > Location Services, scroll down to TheAlaskaApp, and turn off the switch.
Launch the app. Once the app loads and begins responding to use, go back to the settings and turn location services on again.
An alternative method is to uninstall the app, re-download it, and relaunch it—but this time, don’t push any buttons for a minute. Specifically, don’t push “Allow TheAlaskaApp to use location services.” Don’t “Deny” it—just be patient and don’t push “Allow” for a minute.
