KEY POINTS
The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by us.
Road information prevails
. The information provided by the Service is not intended to replace the information provided on the road, such as travel direction, time based restrictions, lane restrictions, road blockades, traffic signs, traffic lights, police instructions, etc.
‍
Cautious driving
. Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to send traffic updates (such as updates on road accidents and traffic congestion), or to non-verbally interact with the Service or use the Service in a non-verbal manner for any purpose other than navigation while driving. Traffic updates or non-verbal reports you want to submit to the Service may only be sent after you have stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. Alternatively, such updates may be sent by a passenger other than the driver, provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.

These features cannot be provided without utilising this technology. Please note, as described in detail in the Privacy Policy:
We use your location and route information to create a detailed route history of all of your journeys made when using the Service. We use this history to offer the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Service it offers to you and to all of its users, to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data, and more as described in detail in the Privacy Policy. This history is associated with your account. This history is private to you and is not shared in any way.
We allow you to use the Service whether or not you choose to set up an account for yourself. If you choose to use the Service without setting up an account you may do so. We will still link all of your information with      your account and a unique identifier generated by us in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
