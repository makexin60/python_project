You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you. If you want to object to this type of processing and exercise your rights, you can contact us via our
privacy form

JET, as a globally operating company, has to take into account various local data retention requirements. We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements.

(i) the period required to serve the respective business purpose;
(ii) to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with an applicable legal requirement; or
(iii) as advisable in light of an applicable statute of limitations.
In the event the data falls into more than one retention terms category, the category with the longer retention requirement shall prevail, other requirements (such as access, security etc.) notwithstanding.
