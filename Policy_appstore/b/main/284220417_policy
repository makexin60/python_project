Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Currency’s website, iOS app, or Android app.
Information We Collect
We do
not
collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location. Our server may store basic technical information, such as your IP address.
All of your app settings are stored on your device — they are
not
stored on our servers. If you are on an iOS device, this information may also be stored in iCloud so that the data syncs to your other iOS devices.
Ads and Analytics
Our app may collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the number of times the app is launched, to improve the app and for internal reporting.
Our app is integrated with Google’s AdMob and Analytics, which allows us to serve advertisements within the app. Google may collect and use personal data, including your device’s advertising ID, for the purposes of serving advertisements.
Our app is integrated with Google’s Firebase and Crashlytics. This allows us to monitor the health of the app and be aware of potential problems that we may wish to fix, such as crashes. This also provides us with analytics and reporting in aggregate.
Our iOS app is integrated with RevenueCat to manage the in-app purchase functionality of the app. If you make an in-app purchase, RevenueCat will receive a receipt containing information about that purchase. RevenueCat does
not
receive or process your payment information, such as a credit card number.
