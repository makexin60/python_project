CMC values and protects privacy and believes in the privacy of its website visitors. Only CMC will use the information that you provide to us through our research or for product delivery, product updates or recalls, or for CMC School notifications.

CMC collects two types of information from registered users: personal data such as name, address, email address, phone number; and site usage data such as information about traffic patterns etc (for example, how many users log in on a daily basis). This Privacy Policy applies to all information submitted to or collected by CMC. If you supply us with your postal address you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about new products or our CMC School. Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding any orders placed or if you have responded to a marketing survey or for order verification. If you do not wish to receive such mailings or telephone calls, please let us know by contacting us by email, telephone or mail as listed below.
Third Parties
We may contract with preferred third party partners to serve ads, newsletters or news or product alerts on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, e-mail address, or any personally identifying information about the user.
Personal Data
Personal data is collected during registration for CMC email subscriber list, in signing up for other web services, CMC School, or response to research surveys.
Site Usage Information
CMC gathers site usage information from both registered and non-registered users. Usage information (such as which pages users visit) is collected through various means. One of these ways is through an IP address, a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are browsing the Web.
Use of Information Collected
CMC uses both the personal and site usage information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customize the content and/or layout of the site for individuals or groups of users, and if requested, to provide information services by email to the user.

Under certain circumstances, CMC may be required to disclose personal and site usage information if required to do so by law or by any court order or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
Anonymity
CMC surveys are anonymous. However, you may be asked to provide your identity to be eligible for a drawing/prize. You may need proof of identity (such as name, address, age or organization affiliation) in order to claim your prize.
Information Security; Retention
Access to user data is limited and can only be accessed by specific individuals with administration privileges. A log is maintained to record who has accessed the data. This log is monitored periodically for security breaches.
CMC may retain personal and site usage information for a reasonable period and only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. After information is no longer required under this Privacy Policy, we may still retain and use information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including personal data, to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
Changes in Our Policy

Security Policy
CMC has appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site or from written, telephone or fax transmission orders. We do not store or file your credit card information. Credit card information is used for the current transaction only; all card information is then deleted after the sale is completed.

CMC generally does not directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).  However, in the process of providing goods or services requested by you we may transfer personal information to business partners for their use in connection with those services. Making personal information available to these companies may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.
