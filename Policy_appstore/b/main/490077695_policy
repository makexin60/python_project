Introduction:
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information while you use our apps and services. We are committed to ensuring transparency and compliance with applicable privacy regulations.
Data Usage and Analytics:
We use analytics tools solely to improve your app experience. These tools help us identify and fix critical bugs or crashes before they are reported by users.
Local Data Storage:
Some apps store information locally on your device. This data is only accessible within the application and is not transmitted externally. Developers have absolutely no access to this local data.
Search and Input Features:
Certain search features within our apps allow users to input information in plain text or through a map interface. Most of these features perform calculations locally on your device without transmitting any data externally. For example, conversions like Latitude and Longitude to formats such as MGRS or UTM are processed entirely on your device.
Location Features:
The current location feature is provided solely for user convenience. Developers have no access to your location data.
However, some app features may require input to be sent to third-party servers for additional calculations. While we do not store this data, these third-party providers may collect it under their privacy policies.

Apps like Elevation, HeightMap, and ThaiElevation use Google Elevation API, which is governed by

We use third-party advertisements to support our applications. Advertisers may use cookies and web beacons to collect information such as your IP address, ISP, and device model.

Advertisers such as Google (via AdSense and AdMob) may collect this information under their respective privacy policies.
Ads Consent:
In compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, we ask for your consent before displaying personalized ads. Non-personalized ads, which do not use your data for targeting, are shown by default if consent is not provided. Users can manage their ad preferences through the app’s settings or as prompted during app usage.
