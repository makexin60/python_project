Scenic Map and You Need A Map do not collect any personal data that can be accessed by anyone other than the user of the app. No personal data is automatically sent to a server. As a user you may record your own tracks and waypoints but they are only stored on your device and only you can choose to share the data with others. Apple does not share the identity of users with app developers so your identity will remain private unless you choose to contact the developer directly.
