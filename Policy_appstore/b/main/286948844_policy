Data Privacy
You share. We don’t.
At Cocoatype, we respect the privacy of users, and don’t share data with anyone you don’t know. For that matter, we prefer to avoid even collecting that data in the first place. Kineo shares as little information as possible to do its job.
Logging.
If you visit the Kineo website (this website!) using a web browser, either a standalone browser or the one included inside the Kineo app, some metadata about that visit is logged temporarily. This may include: your IP address, some information about the browser making the request (such as OS, browser version, etc.), and the time and date of the request.
I basically never look at these logs, but they’re useful for diagnosing issues, and can be used to watch for trends such as where new users are being referred from. These logs are deleted automatically after two weeks.
Customer Support.
If you
e-mail me
, I have the contents of that e-mail and the address that it came from. I generally keep these e-mails forever because it helps identify problems that multiple customers have had, and so I can send updates if your issue is addressed. If you’d rather I not keep your e-mails, just let me know, and they’ll be deleted when our conversation is finished.
Apple.
Apple may (depending on your preferences) collect some analytics about your use of Kineo and send them (anonymized, in bulk) to me for identifying crashes, general usage trends, etc.
