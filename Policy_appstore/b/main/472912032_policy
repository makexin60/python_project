Information About Processors and Third-Country Transfers
Chrono24 may use service providers to process personal data on our behalf (processors) for a number of processes.
Chrono24 has concluded data processing contracts in accordance with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (hereinafter GDPR) with all processors specified in this Data Privacy Policy. These contracts ensure that the processors process the data on our behalf in accordance with the GDPR and that the rights of the data subject are protected.
When personal data are transferred to a third country (e.g., the USA) in connection with these data processing contracts, Chrono24 takes appropriate measures to ensure that a substantially equivalent level of data protection is provided.
Chrono24 has signed standard data protection clauses with all processors that are based in a third country. These clauses have been adopted by the European Commission and, in accordance with Article 46(2)(c) GDPR, constitute an appropriate safeguard to ensure the required level of data protection. In addition, we only commission service providers based in a third country that can demonstrate they can ensure a substantially equivalent level of protection for the personal data transferred by taking appropriate additional measures.

In accordance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, Mangopay is obligated to identify every seller on the basis of specified documents and other information.
For this reason, the following data and documents are required for registering for the Escrow Service and will be transferred to Mangopay:
Last name, first name, email address, date of birth, nationality, and your country of residence.

This involves transferring your phone number to the service provider Twilio Inc. (101 Spear Street, Ste 500, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA). Twilio Inc. conducts two-factor authentication using the phone number provided.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest required by this clause is the general improvement of the marketplace's security and thus optimization of the transaction process.
After registering as a professional dealer on Chrono24, it is possible that we will send you print mail to keep you up to date on the latest watch trends.
This involves transferring the following personal data to the corresponding service provider:
Your first and last name
Your address
The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest required by this clause is the implementation of direct marketing. This is a legally recognized legitimate interest under Recital 47 GDPR.
It is also possible to register as a professional dealer via the contact form displayed as an advertisement on LinkedIn. We receive dealer address data for acquiring new customers by purchasing data and carrying out relevant research online. We use the data we receive to contact you about registering as a professional dealer on Chrono24. The contact form and customer acquisition processes require the following personal data to be processed:
Your first and last name
Your email address
Your business phone number
The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest required by this clause is the purpose of the communication mentioned above.

Complying With US Statutory Tax Requirements (Sales Tax)
In order to comply with US statutory tax requirements, we use AvaTax, a cloud-based solution from our processor Avalara, Inc. (255 South King Street Suite 1800 Seattle, WA 98104, USA). AvaTax automates the determination of sales tax rates and the complex calculation of US sales tax. For this purpose, the following personal data belonging to dealers (see Section 3.2.4.) based in the USA will be processed:
Delivery and billing address
The purpose of data collection is to determine the regional tax regulations we are subject to. In the US, these differ not only at state level but, to some extent, also from county to county. It is therefore essential for us to know exactly where a dealer is located in the USA in order to determine the correct sales tax rate using AvaTax.
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is Article 6(1)(c) and (f) GDPR, as the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of our legal obligation under US tax laws. In addition, as an international marketplace, we have a legitimate interest in observing the legislation in the markets in which we operate. Only the personal data of dealers in the USA who are subject to US tax laws are processed.
Using Our Platform-Internal Messenger
Registered users are able to use the platform-internal messenger to communicate with us and with dealers, buyers, and private sellers. Registration is required to use the platform-internal messenger (see Section 3.2.).
Communication via the platform-internal messenger always takes place between you, the person you are contacting, and Chrono24. Chrono24 is an active participant in the communication and a moderator thereof. When using the platform-internal messenger, we will automatically and manually scan the messages you send. The purposes of doing so are to:
Prevent fraud;
Detect any illegal activities and violations of our general terms and conditions;
Improve communication and customer support.
The data processing takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The processing of data for the purposes specified above is considered a recognized legitimate interest under the GDPR.
You can manage the messages you have sent and received independently, or submit a request for us to delete them. In the event of attempted fraud, illegal activity, or a violation of our general terms and conditions, we may continue to store any relevant messages on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for use as evidence and for establishing, exercising, and defending our legal claims, even if you have submitted a deletion request.
Automatically Creating a Customer Profile
We create a customer profile for your Chrono24 account in order for you to use our platform as a registered user/dealer.

Your personal information (e.g., your basic profile information);
The length of your membership;
Statistical information (e.g., the type, frequency, and intensity of your use of the website);
The history of the listings, brands, and sellers you've visited.

These data are processed in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR provided you have given your consent.
If you decide to participate in a user study, you may be forwarded to a screening questionnaire created with Hotjar, a tool from our processor Hotjar Ltd. (Level 2, St. Julian's Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julian's STJ 1000, Malta). This questionnaire checks whether you are a good match for the study. This involves the processing of the following data:
Your name
Your email address
Your phone number
These data are processed in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR provided you have given your consent.
Furthermore, in the questionnaire, you will be asked which additional processing of your personal data you consent to as part of the user study. With your consent, the following processing occurs on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR:
Recording of the conversation
Sharing and recording of your screen
The recording facilitates the internal evaluation of the study and is deleted upon the study's completion. It takes place using the video and telecommunication software Zoom. Zoom is a service provided by Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (55 Almaden Boulevard, 6th Floor, San Jose, CA 95113, USA).
We have implemented additional security measures by changing our Zoom configurations so that all online meetings are only processed by data centers in the European Union, European Economic Area, or secure third countries like Canada or Japan.
After-Sales Calls
To improve the lead time of after-sales calls, we commission a call center. If you potentially initiated a purchase on the platform, your data will be forwarded to a call center so that you can be called to confirm whether a sale took place. This involves forwarding the following personal data to the call center:
Your first and last name
Your phone number
The legal basis for the processing of the personal data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest required by this clause is improving the lead time of after-sales calls and thus improving the customer experience.
We use the services of our processor Termitel GmbH (Zehntwiesenstr. 37, 76275 Ettlingen, Germany) to conduct after-sales calls.
Translation of User-Generated Content
In order to translate dealer reviews, messages sent via the Chrono24 Messenger, listings, and listing descriptions, we use the Google Translate API from our processor Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). We also use the DeepL Translate API from our processor DeepL SE (Maarweg 165, 50825 Cologne, Germany) to translate listing descriptions.
Personal data may be transferred depending on the content that is translated.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the purposes outlined above and the associated user-oriented design of the website, in particular the removal of language barriers for communicating user-generated content.
Recording of Calls
For quality assurance and training purposes, and with your consent, we record incoming calls. The following personal data are processed for this purpose:
Audio data
Content of the conversation
Data are only processed by the employees involved in the call and their supervisor. Third parties do not have access to your personal data.
These data are processed in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR provided you have given us your express consent.
Call recordings are only stored for 90 days and deleted thereafter.
Contact With Our Support Team
If you reach out to our support team by phone or email, they will use the omnichannel tool Sprinklr, provided by our partner Sprinklr, Inc. (29 West 35th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA; hereinafter "Sprinklr"), to manage your contact information.
The following personal data will be processed:
Your first and last name
Your address
Your request
Depending on whether you contact us by phone or email, your email address or phone number will also be processed using our omnichannel tool.
Your personal data is processed at your request and is necessary according to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Our use of the omnichannel tool Sprinklr to improve customer management is our legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
If you give your effective consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) at the beginning of a telephone call, the call will also be recorded. The recording will be used exclusively for training purposes and transcribed to ensure that your request can be fully processed. The recording will be deleted after three months.
We also use Sprinklr AI, the artificial intelligence (hereinafter "AI") from Sprinklr, Inc., to summarize the content of emails and transcripts requiring consent and to help our team communicate with you and process your requests. Any and all personal data is anonymized before the content of emails and transcripts is transmitted to and processed by the AI. It is important to note that complete anonymization cannot be guaranteed; however, we have contractually agreed with Sprinklr that the transmitted content will not be used for AI training purposes. This means that processing can be carried out for the stated purposes, while transfer of personal data is kept to a minimum.
The processing of your personal data using AI is carried out according to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The legitimate interest required by this provision derives from the aforementioned purposes.
Creating Invoices and Trusted Checkout Certificates
When you buy a watch on our platform, we usually provide you with an invoice and a Trusted Checkout certificate in PDF format. These PDF files are created using a server provided by our processor, Amazon Web Services EMEA Sarl (38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg; hereinafter "AWS"). To do this, we encrypt the required data and send it to AWS, which then generates the PDF files on the server. These PDF files are then encrypted and sent to us.
Depending on the PDF file created for you, the following personal information may be processed by AWS:
Your first and last name,
Your delivery address,
Your billing address,
Your telephone number, and
Your e-mail address.
The processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and your contractual partner (in this case, the buyer or seller of the watch involved in the transaction), in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR.
In order to comply with the formal requirements for document retention under German law (Section 147 of the German Fiscal Code), invoices are deleted 10 years after they are issued. Trusted Checkout certificates are deleted 6 months after they are issued.
Disclosure of Data
We only disclose your personal data to third parties when:
You have provided your express consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR;
Disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation in accordance with Article 6(1)(c) GDPR;
Disclosure is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding legitimate interest that precludes disclosure of your data in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

Accordingly, sellers in the USA who generate transactions of $600 or more in one calendar year must file a Form 1099-K with the IRS. Mangopay, as a payment service provider, is obligated to report to the IRS sellers in the USA who are required to file such forms. To this end, as a platform operator, we ask sellers in the USA to provide the required taxpayer identification numbers as part of the registration process. We then transfer these taxpayer identification numbers to Mangopay in order to ensure that both Mangopay and Chrono24 can fully comply with their legal obligations to the IRS.
If you are a seller located in the USA, we will process your taxpayer identification number with Mangopay as joint controllers on the basis of Article 26 GDPR. We have entered into a corresponding agreement for this joint responsibility with regard to the personal data concerned.

Pixels
Pixels, also known as tracking pixels, are small 1√ó1 pixel GIF files that can be stored in graphics or emails, e.g., when you visit a website. Pixels do not harm your device and do not contain any viruses, Trojans, or other malicious software.
The pixels send your IP address, the referrer URL of the website you visited, the time at which the pixel was viewed, the browser used, and previously saved cookie information to a web server. This allows us to measure reach and other statistical analyses to optimize our platform and offerings.
Most browsers accept pixels automatically. You can prevent the use of pixels on our sites by using appropriate tools or browser add-ons (e.g., the "AdBlock" add-on for Firefox).

If your data are transferred, the marketing agencies are our processors (see Section 2.). We generally only work with agencies for a limited period of time. By concluding data processing contracts, the marketing agencies are obligated to immediately delete all personal data they received from us and not use these data for their own purposes after the contractual relationship has ended.
Analysis Tools
Tracking Tools
The following tracking measures are only used if you have provided your express consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent separately for each individual tool with future effect at any time with the help of the Consent Manager, which you will find at the end of this Data Privacy Policy. The lawfulness of processing up until the time you withdraw your consent is not affected. The purpose of the tracking measures is to ensure that our website has a user-oriented design and continues to be optimized. At the same time, we use the tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and evaluate such use to further optimize our offerings for your benefit.
The purposes and categories of the data processing are listed below.
Google Analytics
In order to ensure a user-oriented design and continuous optimization of our websites, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by our processor Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter "Google"). In this context, pseudonymized user profiles are created and cookies (see Section 6.1.) are used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website includes:
Your browser type and version
Your operating system
The referrer URL (the previous page you visited)
The host name of the querying computer (IP address)
Time of the server request
These data are transferred to one of Google's servers in the USA and stored there.
The information is used to evaluate website use, compile reports on website activity, and to provide further services associated with website and Internet usage for the purposes of market research and the user-oriented design of these web pages. This information may also be transferred to third parties as appropriate, insofar as this is required by law or insofar as these parties process the data on our behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other data from Google. IP addresses are anonymized to eliminate any possibility of this happening (IP masking).
You can disable the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, this may prevent you from using all the features of our site to their full extent.

.
Google Ads
In order to statistically record the use of our website and to optimize our offerings for your benefit, we use the Google Ads tool provided by our processor Google (for more information about Google, see Section 7.1.1.). Google Ads saves a cookie (see Section 6.1.) on your computer if you have accessed our website via a Google advertisement. The information generated by the cookie is transferred to one of Google's servers in the USA and stored there.
These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of a Google Ads customer's website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user clicked on the advertisement and was taken to this page.
Each Google Ads customer receives a different cookie, meaning cookies cannot be tracked across websites operated by different Google Ads customers. The information collected via the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for Google Ads customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. Google Ads customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their advertisement and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users.
If you want to opt out of tracking, you can deactivate the cookie required for tracking in your browser settings. You can find Google's privacy policy regarding tracking using Google Ads

Meta Custom Audiences
In order to statistically record the use of our website and to optimize our offerings for your benefit, we use the Meta Custom Audiences tool provided by our processor Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. (4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland; hereinafter "Meta"). Meta saves a cookie (see Section 6.1.) on your computer if you have accessed our website via an advertisement from Meta. The information generated by the cookie is transferred to one of Meta's servers in the USA and stored there.
These cookies expire after 180 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of a website operated by a Meta Custom Audiences customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Meta and the customer can recognize that the user clicked on the advertisement and was redirected to that page.
Each Meta Custom Audiences customer receives a different cookie, meaning cookies cannot be tracked across websites operated by different Meta Custom Audiences customers. The information collected using the cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Meta Custom Audiences customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. Meta Custom Audiences customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their advertisement and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users.
If you want to opt out of tracking, you can deactivate the cookie required for tracking in your browser settings. You can find Meta's privacy policy regarding tracking using Meta Custom Audiences

Google Customer Match
In order to match customers with similar interests, we use Google Ad's Customer Match lists from our processing partner Google Ireland Ltd. (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; hereinafter referred to as "Google"). To use Customer Match, lists of encrypted ("hashed") email addresses are uploaded to Google. Google then compares those email addresses to see if they match existing Google customers. This information can then be used to create audiences for targeted ads and ad campaigns. The matching process can take up to 48 hours. We use secure hash algorithms to pseudonymize the email addresses we send to Google. This form of encryption provides the highest level of protection for your data. Once the matching process is complete, the encrypted email addresses are automatically deleted, ensuring that Google does not acquire any new addresses.

Social Media
When it comes to social media, we understand our responsibilities for processing personal data. In this context, we would like to inform you about the use of social media plugins on our platform and our responsibility under data protection law in connection with our social media presences.
Social Media Plugins
We use social plugins for different social networks on our website. The legal basis is Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent for each individual tool with future effect at any time with the help of the Consent Manager, which you can find at the end of this Data Privacy Policy. The lawfulness of processing up until the time you withdraw your consent is not affected. It is the responsibility of the respective provider to ensure that operation is in compliance with data protection regulations.
Social media buttons are integrated using our specially-developed solution that prevents a connection to a social network from being established simply because you visit a page with a social media button, without you having activated it. This means that information is not transferred to the social network until you activate the button.
Facebook
Our platform uses social media plugins from Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. (4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland; hereinafter "Facebook") to personalize the user experience, for example through the use of "Like" and "Share" buttons. These are Facebook offerings.
When you visit a page of our online presence featuring such a plugin, and you activate that plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. The plugin content is sent by Facebook directly to your browser and integrated into the site.
When a plugin is integrated, Facebook receives the information that your browser accessed the corresponding page of our online presence, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are currently not logged in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is transferred by your browser directly to one of Facebook's servers in the USA and stored there.
If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can directly associate your visit to our website with your Facebook account. If you interact with a plugin, for example by clicking the "Like" or "Share" button, the corresponding information is also transferred directly to one of Facebook's servers and stored there. The information is also published on Facebook and displayed to your Facebook friends.
Facebook can use this information for the purposes of advertising, market research, and designing Facebook pages in a user-oriented manner. This involves Facebook creating user, interest, and relationship profiles, for example to evaluate your use of our website in relation to advertisements displayed to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users of your activities on our website, and to provide other services related to the use of Facebook.
If you do not want Facebook to associate information about you collected via our online presence to your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website.
Please see
Facebook's privacy policy
for information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by Facebook, your data privacy rights, and data privacy configuration settings.
X (Formerly Twitter)
Plugins from the microblogging and social network X from Twitter International Unlimited Company (One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07 Ireland; hereinafter "X") are integrated into our web pages. X plugins (e.g., the post button) can be identified by the X logo that appears on our website.
When you visit a page of our online presence featuring such a plugin, and you activate that plugin, a direct connection is established between your browser and an X server. X then receives information that you have visited our page and your IP address. You can link content from our webpages with your X account by clicking on the "Post" button while logged in to your X account. This enables X to cross-reference your visit to our webpages to your user account. Please note that, as website provider, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transferred or regarding its use by X.
If you do not want X to associate your visit to our pages, please log out of your X account before visiting our website.

Instagram
Our website also uses social plugins from Instagram, which is operated by Instagram LLC. (1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA; hereinafter "Instagram").
The plugins are marked with an Instagram logo, for example the "Instagram camera."
When you visit a page of our online presence featuring such a plugin, and you activate that plugin yourself, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Instagram servers. The plugin content is sent by Instagram directly to your browser and integrated into the site. When a plugin is integrated, Instagram receives the information that your browser accessed the corresponding page of our online presence, even if you do not have an Instagram account or are currently not logged in to Instagram.
This information (including your IP address) is transferred by your browser directly to an Instagram server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged in to Instagram, Instagram can directly associate your visit to our website with your Instagram account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking the "Instagram" button, this information is also transferred directly to an Instagram server and stored there.
The information will also be published on your Instagram account and shown to your followers.
If you do not want Instagram to associate information about you collected via our online presence directly with your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram before visiting our website.

We conduct and manage outreach campaigns using the Pitchbox tool provided by Pitchbox, LLC (626 Jacksonville Rd., Suite 105, Warminster, PA 18974, USA). Pitchbox is a web-based solution that enables us to send and receive emails and measure the success of our outreach campaigns.

Your email address
You may be contacted via Pitchbox during an outreach campaign. The legal basis for this is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest required by this clause is in direct marketing recognized in Recital 47 GDPR and the fact that only bloggers and editors who may have an interest in working with Chrono24 are contacted.
Solutions for Fraud Prevention
We want to make buying and selling on Chrono24 as secure as possible. We therefore use solutions from specialized service providers in order to prevent fraud and receive information regarding transactions on Chrono24. The IP address of the device that accesses our website as well as other data relating to the use of Chrono24 are processed. It is not possible for us to assign such data to a specific user. This is only carried out in cases where fraudulent behavior is suspected based on the information received. The specialized service providers may be based in the USA. We only work with service providers that offer the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission and thus guarantee an appropriate level of data protection equivalent to that in the EU. The legal basis is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Preventing fraud attempts at the expense of our customers as well as at our own expense is expressly recognized as a legitimate interest in Recital 47 GDPR.
IDnow
To identify users on our platform, we use the AutoIdent technology from our processor IDnow (Auenstrasse 100, 80469 Munich, Germany). This is a verification app that captures the end user's identification document using a smartphone camera and completes online verification. The following personal data are collected:
Your first and last name

Video recording of your face
We also collect personal data from the identification document, which is used to confirm the identity of the user beyond doubt. All information is used exclusively for the purposes of verifying and identifying the user. Further processing for other purposes does not take place.
The AutoIdent solution is not a fully automated process. As soon as the verification app detects any discrepancies, IDnow employees manually double-check the data.
Personal data are collected in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to take steps prior to entering into a contract.
Data are also collected on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is preventing fraud and, thus, increasing the marketplace's overall security.
Reporting a Listing
If you suspect that a listing is fraudulent, you can report it to Chrono24 using the appropriate form. This involves transferring the following personal data to our processors Sparkpost and Mailgun:
Your first and last name
Your email address

Chrono24 Direct GmbH is a partner company of Chrono24 that lists watches on our platform. The user's personal data are transferred to Chrono24 Direct GmbH in order to prevent the latter from entering into potentially fraudulent transactions. In such cases, the following personal data are exchanged between Chrono24 GmbH and Chrono24 Direct GmbH:
Your email address
Your first and last name
The legal basis for transferring personal data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Chrono24 GmbH and Chrono24 Direct GmbH's legitimate interests required by this clause as joint controllers under Article 26 GDPR are preventing fraud and, thus, increasing the platform's overall security.
We have agreed with Chrono24 Direct to act as joint controllers within the meaning of Article 26 GDPR to ensure that the rights and freedoms of data subjects continue to be guaranteed by both parties. Furthermore, both parties undertake to process data in accordance with the GDPR.
Spam Protection
We use Turnstile, a tool provided by our processor Cloudflare, Inc. (101 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA; hereinafter "Cloudflare"), to determine whether interactions on our website are performed by humans or automated machines. This way, we can protect our website from automated spam, spying, and misuse.
In order to do this, Turnstile automatically selects from a set of browser challenges based on telemetry and user behavior during a session on our website. This data includes but is not limited to the following:
Your IP address
Information about your system configurations
Information about your operating system
Your device settings (e.g., language and browser settings, header, user agent)
Turnstile also uses private access tokens to carry out analysis for the purpose described above. These tokens are provided by device manufacturers and help Turnstile confirm whether visitors to our website are indeed human. By working with third parties such as device manufacturers, data can be validated without having to be captured again by Turnstile.
If Turnstile's purely data-driven analysis does not deliver clear results, the site visitor is prompted to take another action (e.g., click a button). This interaction serves as a final check as to whether the website visitor is human.
Cloudflare does not process the data for its own purposes. Furthermore, no cookies are set in the course of the analysis, nor are cookies searched for in order to collect or store information.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data within the context of our spam protection procedure with Turnstile is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The legitimate interest required by this clause is the purposes mentioned above and, thus, improving the marketplace's overall security.

Your personal data will only be processed to verify your identity and will not be used for any other purpose.
The personal information you provide will be deleted after 96 hours. The result of the identity verification process will be visible to us for 90 days.
The AutoIdent solution is not a fully automated process. If Ubble detects any discrepancies during the identity verification process, the data is checked again manually by an employee.

Microsoft Teams
In order to conduct virtual meetings and webinars and to communicate via chat, we use the Microsoft Teams communication platform provided by our processor Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland; hereinafter "Teams").
