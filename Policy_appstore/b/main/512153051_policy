Journal Club
Did COPERNICUS really show that carvedilol was the center of the CHF universe?  Was it FACTT that looked at CVP targets in ARDS? Journal Club for iPhone and Android answers these questions by putting landmark trials at your fingertips!
Journal Club for iPhone and Android harness the collaborative editing power of Wiki Journal Club (
wikijournalclub.org
) to provide you up-to-date summaries of the articles you need to know. Written by medicine physicians, these article summaries are distilled into a thorough but supremely concise bottom line. Read on to flesh out the article's major points, design, interventions, outcomes, and criticisms.

Privacy
Journal Club uses Google Analytics to collect anonymous user data. We occasionally use Bitly redirect links, which similarly captures anonymous user data. The anonymous user data that is collected cannot be used to identify you. The data are multiple and include articles being viewed, mobile device types being used (eg, Nexus 6 or iPhone 6S), mobile device operating system (eg, Android 5.1 or iOS 9.0), and links that are clicked on. We use this information to see trends in article popularity to help guide content development. We also use this information for research projects, under a Johns Hopkins University IRB-approved non-human subjects research protocol, which are published or presented at professional conferences, peer-reviewed medical literature, and in promotional materials. (See
Plante TB, 2015
for an example of one such publication.)
At this time, there is no method to opt out of Google Analytics data collection for the iOS app. Users of the Android app can opt out of Google Analytics under Preferences.
