Always Active
These cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly and cannot be switched off in the cookie settings menu for our Services. Without these cookies, the Services will not function properly.  For example, we use these cookies to remember information you have entered on forms during a web browser session; to identify you as being logged into our website; for security purposes (such as to detect and prevent bot activity, malicious traffic, and suspicious logins and activity); and to route users to specific applications or specific servers, to optimize page and content loading, and to manage traffic.  You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but if you block them, certain parts of this website or the Services may not function properly or be available to you.  Some necessary cookies may be managed for us by third parties, and we and these third parties may collect IP address, referring URL, and other browser and device-related information through these cookies.
Analytics and Performance Cookies
Inactive (Off)
These cookies generate and collect information about your use of our Services—e.g., which pages you visit, how long you spend logged in or on a page, what content or features you use or search for, and issues you may be experiencing—and they help track unique visits and traffic sources and other aggregate usage information.  We use these cookies to measure and improve the performance of our websites and Services.  For example, they help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the website.  Some of our performance cookies are managed for us by third parties.
Functional Cookies
Inactive (Off)
These cookies enable us to provide enhanced functionality and personalization.  For example, we use these cookies to remember settings you've applied, such as language, to provide and show embedded videos and content, and to make available certain other features. Some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties, including by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.  If you do not allow these cookies, then certain features on this website may not be available or function properly.
Targeting Cookies

These are third-party cookies that allow us to better reach you with relevant ads and content—both on our Services and on third-party websites, apps and online services—and to measure and improve our advertising and marketing.  These cookies enable third-party companies to track your visits to our websites and the Services, as well as other websites, apps and online services, which they use to understand your interests and activities in order to provide you more relevant ads and content on behalf of us and other companies.  If you do not allow these cookies, you will still see ads and targeted content, but they may be less relevant to you.

Similar to targeting cookies, they may enable these third-party companies to track your visits to our websites and access to the Services, as well as other websites, apps and online services, in order to understand your browsing activities and interests.
