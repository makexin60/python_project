For more information about the types of personal data we collect or otherwise Process, see

WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
When you use the Platform(s) and/or our Services, we collect and receive two types of data:
Data that, alone or in combination with other reasonably available data, can be used to identify you ("
Personal Data
"). For clarity, ‚ÄúPersonal Data‚Äù includes any personal information, personal data or personally identifiable information as defined by the privacy or data protection laws in your jurisdiction; and
Non-Personal Data that cannot be used to identify you (for example, aggregated statistical data about the use of our website, or data about a particular member that does not include any identifying data) ("
Non-Personal Data
"). For clarity, Non-Personal Data does not constitute Personal Data and any collection or other Processing of Non-Personal Data is not subject to Processing practices contemplated by this Privacy Policy. Any discussion regarding Non-Personal Data made in this Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes only.
We collect and receive the following Personal Data and Non-Personal Data directly from you and automatically through your use of our Services:
Data we will request from you
When you create a profile on our Platform(s), you will be required to provide the following data. Without this data, we will be unable to create an account for you or provide the Services:
create a
username
(a unique name of your choice) and a
password
,
contact information
(for example, your email address),
your
relationship status
, including what you are looking for from the Services (for example, if you are a single male seeking females
*
); and
demographic information
(your city of residence, zip/postal code and date of birth for the purpose of determining your age).
* This is sensitive Personal Data (because it indicates your sexual orientation) that is necessary for your use of the Services (i.e., so you can find potential connections that might be desirable to you). Accordingly, when you sign up for a new account (or, for existing users, whenever we update this Privacy Policy or the
Terms and Conditions
), we will require your express consent to our Processing of any sensitive Personal Data that you provide when creating the account or, thereafter, when you edit your profile, send messages to other members, etc.
When you make a purchase from our Platform(s), you are required to provide billing information, including your chosen payment method, in order for us to be able to process your transaction. Some payment methods (e.g., a credit or debit card), will require you also to provide your name and billing address. Failure to provide adequate billing information means we would be unable to provide the requested Services/features.
At your option, you may choose to activate 2-factor authentication for your account through a third-party member authentication service. This service is based on providing you with a verification code, which you enter when logging into your Cougar Life account, in order to confirm your identity. The third-party vendor sends verification codes by text message to a telephone number that you provide to Cougar Life. To facilitate your use of this service, we will be required to share your telephone number with the vendor, in order to link it to your Cougar Life account, and will therefore ask for your phone number for this purpose. Note that this verification service is not part of our Services, and is subject to the third-party‚Äôs terms and conditions, including different policies with respect to the Processing of your Personal Data. We do not have control over the vendor. You will need to make your own independent judgment regarding your interaction with them. Please note that, if you decide to delete your Cougar Life account, we will delete your phone number from our records, but this will not affect the third-party vendor with respect to the phone number we provided to them on your behalf. You will need to contact them directly with respect to management of your account, including any deletion requests. As the vendor we use to provide this service may change from time to time, we are not naming them in this Privacy Policy. If you wish to know the name of the current vendor, so you can review their policies or make a deletion request, please contact us using our
Contact Form
. You also may choose to use an authentication application of your choice to provide you with 2-factor authentication. In such case, the personal data (if any) required to use that application shall be subject to the terms and conditions and/or privacy policy of the company that provides the authentication application, as we do not have control over such authentication applications.
Data that is generated when you use the Platform(s)
You may send messages on the Platform(s), which may include or reveal Personal Data about you. Generally, we do not moderate or actively review the data which you include in messages sent between members but this data is available to us and we may monitor it for fraud, or where we suspect members of being under the age of 18, or of using our Services for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our
Terms and Conditions
or of this Privacy Policy. You only should message sensitive Personal Data (e.g., about your race, health, or sexual preferences) in situations where you are comfortable voluntarily to make this data public and you consent to our Processing of any sensitive Personal Data (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws).
Data you may choose to provide to us
While creating your profile, you may choose how much data you share with us. You will be offered the chance to upload/provide:
a photograph
(we provide tools to allow you to blur or add masks to any photographs);
personal characteristics
such as your height
*
, weight
*
, body
*
type and gender (although you may tell us you would rather not say);
your
ethnicity
*
(although you may tell us you would rather not say); and
a
personal description
.
* This is sensitive Personal Data (because it includes information about your health or race). Accordingly, when you sign up for a new account (or, for existing users, whenever we update this Privacy Policy or the
Terms and Conditions
), we will require your express consent to our Processing of any sensitive Personal Data that you provide when creating the account or, thereafter, when you edit your profile, send messages to other members, etc.
Once you create an account on the Platform(s), you may include edit details that you already provided to us or provide additional details about yourself through the Profile page such as:
details of any
languages spoken
; and
details of
smoking habits
(although you may choose not to specify your habits).
You are encouraged to create a pseudonymous profile and are not required to include data in your profile that would allow you to be directly identified. If you want to remain anonymous to the general public, please be careful about what you choose to share, especially if you upload photographs, and do not choose a username which could allow you to be identified easily.
Data that will be collected automatically from your device
Where you have enabled the setting on your mobile device, with your permission, we also will collect your location data to help you identify other Platform members in your area who also have enabled this setting. You may turn off this functionality through the location settings on your mobile device. We also collect your IP address(es), which may reveal your general geographic location from your browser access, to help us respond quickly and efficiently to inquiries and requests and to help us protect against fraud.
We also collect Personal Data through use of cookies and other tracking devices. For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking devices, see
Section 11
, below.
Data collected from third parties
Occasionally, we may receive Personal Data about you from third parties, such as from a credit card company or issuer with respect to a disputed charge, or from another member of the Services respecting a complaint about your activities while using the Services; however, we do not seek or purchase Personal Data about you from third parties.

We collect your data as a Data Controller when we have a legal basis to do so. The following legal bases pertain to our collection of data:
Our use of your Personal Data is necessary to perform a
contract

Where the information Processed is a ‚Äúspecial category of personal data‚Äù (known as sensitive data ‚Äì in particular health information or information about your sexual preferences or ethnicity), we require an additional lawful basis, which will be your
consent.
Our use of your Personal Data is in our
legitimate interest
as a commercial organization to make improvements to our products and Services and to expand our business. For example, this applies to our Processing activities described at 4B, 4C, 4D, 4H, 4M,4Q (save where we need consent by jurisdictional law) and for certain purposes in 4F and 4I.
Our use of your Personal Data is
necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation
that we have, in particular, where we are required to disclose Personal Data to a court, tax authority or regulatory body in the event of an investigation. For example, this applies to some purposes involved our Processing activities described at 4E, 4F, 4J, 4K and 4L.
Our use of your Personal Data is in accordance with your
consent
. For example, this applies to our Processing activities described at 4E, 4H, 4K, 4M, 4N and 4O (in each case where required by jurisdictional law).
HOW WILL WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?
We may provide Personal Data to third parties in the following limited circumstances:
To
trusted third parties
, to assist us in the provision of the Services and the operation of our business.

engaged to perform services on our behalf
, based on our instructions, such as to our parent, subsidiary or sister companies, or to advertising agencies, marketing agents, credit card payment processors, data processing and storage companies or organizations which provide administrative and support services to us.
We limit our disclosure of your Personal Data to such third parties to that which is
reasonably necessary for the purpose
or service for which the third-party service provider is engaged.
We also use
contractual and other means
to provide a comparable level of protection while the data is being Processed by such third parties, including limiting such providers to using your Personal Data solely to provide us with the specific service for which those providers were engaged, and for no other purpose. You can obtain more information about our policies and practices with respect to the use of Personal Data by third-party service providers by contacting
dpo@cougarlife.com
.
To
courts, regulators and law enforcement
as required or permitted by law, including:
to
government bodies and law enforcement agencies
, pursuant to warrant, order, subpoena or statutory requirement;
in connection with any
legal proceedings
or prospective legal proceedings involving Cougar Life; and
to otherwise
establish, exercise or defend our legal rights
and protect against misuse of our Platform(s) (including providing information to third parties for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk), or to protect the personal safety and property of our members or the public as permitted by law. This means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.
In the event of a
sale or merger
, including:
as required, in connection with the sale, assignment, bankruptcy proceeding or other transfer of the business or a portion of the business of our Platform(s), including a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of assets or other corporate change of our direct or indirect parent companies that affects us, as well as the insurance or securitization of our assets. In any such case, the recipient parties will be required contractually to keep the information confidential and use it only for the purposes of the transaction, or proposed transaction, in question.
In the event a business transaction is completed, assignees or successors of our business or assets may use and disclose your Personal Data, as obtained from Cougar Life only for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless your further consent is obtained.
We do not otherwise share, give, rent or sell your Personal Data to any third parties, unless you give us additional consent to do so.
You should be aware that some of your Personal Data will be provided to, or otherwise visible to, other members of the Services as part of the normal operation of the Services (as set out in the terms or descriptions of specific features). For example, your username, profile information and any information that you post to the Platform(s) will be available to, and searchable by, other members of the Platform(s) and Services. In the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, the lawful basis for this disclosure is voluntarily making the data public. If you are not comfortable making this data public, you can use our Hide Profile feature, which allows your profile to remain private and un-searchable.
Other members of the Services, who may be located in any country in the world where our Services are offered, may also receive notifications (on the Services, via email, or through device notifications) that promote your profile, including your nickname and your profile photo. Please note that we cannot prevent the content you post or share on our Platform(s) or Services from being used by other members in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy, or from being shared or disclosed by other members.
We may disclose Non-Personal Data in a number of circumstances including to third-party advertisers.
DATA TRANSFERS
As we have a multi-national business operation, your Personal Data may be transferred between Cougar Life Inc. and CL Media Inc., or between either of those entities and our parent, subsidiary or sister entities, or disclosed to service providers to enable their provision of services. As a result, your Personal Data may be collected, stored, accessed, used, and/or disclosed (as aforementioned, these activities involve ‚ÄúProcessing‚Äù your Personal Data) in countries outside your jurisdiction of residence. For example: (i) we host Cougar Life in Canada; (ii) we may provide customer support in European Economic Area member states (including Cyprus) and, potentially, other countries; and (iii) some of your information which we use to send you email messages may be stored by a third party in the United States. Additionally, your profile will be accessible by members all over the world. If you are concerned about this, you can stop using our Services at any time. Some of these jurisdictions do not have an equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your country; however, we will take steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within your country of residence (based on the country you have indicated in your account, which should be either Canada or the USA, as our Services currently are not intended for use in other jurisdictions). You have a right to request details about the appropriate safeguard where this is documented (but it may be redacted to ensure confidentiality).
SECURITY
We take the protection of your Personal Data seriously. We implement appropriate measures and take steps to protect Personal Data against loss and theft as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, and modification using security safeguards, including physical, organizational and technological measures, commensurate with the sensitivity of your Personal Data. Our employees who have access to your Personal Data are made aware of the importance of keeping it confidential.
Where we use service providers who might have access to your Personal Data, we require them to have privacy and security standards that are comparable to ours. We use contracts and other measures with our service providers to maintain the confidentiality and security of your Personal Data and to prevent it from being used for any other purpose.
Please be aware that no data security measures can guarantee complete security. You also should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your phone, other mobile device, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, relying on two-factor authentication, and keeping your log-in and password private.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT?
We keep your Personal Data for as long as it is required for the purposes for which it was collected, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, after which we delete or de-identify your Personal Data, rendering it Non-Personal Data.
In general, we retain your Personal Data for a period of time corresponding to a statute of limitations setting out the period during which legal claims may be filed in court. For example, we‚Äôll retain your Personal Data during the statute of limitations period, to maintain an accurate record of your dealings with us and, as applicable, assert or defend against a legal claim. We automatically delete data where an account has been inactive (e.g. no messages sent, etc.) for 18 months. As a general rule, we will hold purchase information for 6 months past account deletion to ensure that we can deal with any chargeback/payment penalties. However, in some circumstances, we may retain Personal Data for other periods of time; for instance, where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request or demand, for so long as required.
CHILDREN
The Platform(s) and Services are not for use by individuals under the age of 18 years old. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect, store, access, use or disclose the Personal Data of individuals under 18 years old. If you are under the age of 18 years, please do not use the Services or provide any Personal Data, even if prompted by the website to do so.
YOUR RIGHTS
You have the ability to exercise the following rights:
Right to Withdraw Consent.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions. For example, if you wish to opt out of receiving electronic marketing communications, communications that suggest matches to you, or other types of non-transactional communications, you can change your settings in your account on the website (via the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù section under ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù) or in a mobile application (via the ‚ÄúContact Options‚Äù section), use the 'unsubscribe' or ‚Äòemail preferences‚Äô link provided in our emails, or otherwise contact us directly (see
Section 15
, below) and we will stop sending you electronic marketing and/or other non-transactional communications per your instructions. For greater clarification, ‚Äútransactional communications‚Äù include but are not limited to such things as welcome emails, billing information, payment receipts, payment cancellation, password reset instructions, advisory emails about safeguarding your security and privacy, and confirmation of account deactivation.
Note that if you wish to stop receiving transactional communications, you will have to delete your account as these communications are necessary to provide you with the Services.
Right of Access, Rectification and Erasure.
You have the right to request access to and obtain a copy of any of your Personal Data that we may hold, to request correction of any inaccurate data relating to you, and to request the deletion of your Personal Data under certain circumstances. Please note that you can hide certain information visible to members of the Platform(s) at any time by going to the ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù and ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù sections in your account on the website, or the ‚ÄúProfile Options‚Äù section in your account in the mobile applications.
Data Portability.
Where the Personal Data is Processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such Personal Data which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.
Right to Restriction of Processing.
You have the right to restrict our Processing of your Personal Data (meaning we could only store it, unless we have your consent or as otherwise required by law) where:
you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
where we no longer need your Personal Data for the purposes of the Processing, but you require such Personal Data for the purposes of a dispute, complaint or proceeding.
Right to object to direct marketing (including profiling).
You have the right to object to our use of your Personal Data (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your Personal Data to inform you of our promotions or those of third parties.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the privacy commissioner with jurisdiction over your place of residence if you consider that the Processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law (although we ask you to try resolve any complaints with us first).
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided in
Section 15
, below.
COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING
Where we have necessary permissions and consents in accordance with jurisdictional laws, we use cookies, clear GIFs, third-party analytics and other tracking mechanisms to track your use of our Platform(s) and the Services. As you use our sites or mobile applications, these tracking mechanisms may collect information automatically, such as: your IP address, browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; how you move through the Services and the length of time you use the Services, or particular features or pages of the Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Platform(s). We may combine this information with other Personal Data we collect about you for statistical purposes, for measuring effectiveness of advertising, for fraud detection and in order to assist our customer service representatives in responding to your inquiries.
Provided we have obtained necessary permissions and consents in accordance with jurisdictional laws, we use these tools only to provide you with a more personalized member experience, to better understand your needs and preferences, to provide you with content (including advertising and marketing emails) that is most relevant to you, and to monitor trends respecting the usage of our site and mobile applications.
Do-Not-Track.
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser ‚Äúdo-not-track‚Äù requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
Cookies.
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer‚Äôs hard drive, through your web browser, for record-keeping purposes. We might use cookies to uniquely identify your browser/device/IP address, in order to help us to process your transactions and requests, to track aggregate and statistical information about member activity, and to display advertising both on our Platform(s) and on third-party sites. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies some features of our Platform(s) may not function. Further information may be found at
www.allaboutcookies.org
. It is important to note that some cookies (including some persistent cookies) may be created by your web browser, rather than by us, so you would need to deal with your web browser‚Äôs settings to prevent or delete those, as we would have no control over them. For additional information, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Clear GIFs.
Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, though, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages, not stored on your hard drive. These ‚Äúimages‚Äù automatically are loaded to your browser/device when you visit our website or open an html format email message from us, thereby letting us know if a certain page was visited or an email message was opened. Clear GIFs allow us to record simple member actions related to our websites and to email communications received from us, in order to help us determine the usage and effectiveness of our site and communications. We might use clear GIFs to track the activities of our website visitors and members, and our mobile application members, to help us manage content and compile statistics about usage. We and our third-party service providers also might use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded. These may be blocked by using a third-party application (look for a browser extension for content-filtering, including ad-blocking) or, in the case of emails, by changing your settings to prevent images from being downloaded (where your email provider supports this functionality).
Third-Party Analytics.
We also may use automated devices and applications, such as
Google Analytics
(to opt out, go
here
),
AppsFlyer
(to opt out, go
here
) and
Dynatrace
to evaluate usage of our Platform(s) and the Services we provide. We may use these tools to obtain aggregated statistical information about the use of our Services to help us improve our Services, performance and member experiences. These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our Platform(s) with other information that they have collected about you from your use of other sites. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection, storage, access, use and disclosure of the tracking data collected by third-party analytics providers. For further information, please see the relevant party's privacy policy.
Third-Party Ad Networks.
We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Platform(s) and on third-party websites or other media, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. This would enable us and these third parties to target your browser with advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested, based on inferences made from browser activity. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party‚Äôs specific privacy policy, not this one. In some situations, we may provide these third-party advertisers with limited information about members (e.g., IP address and basic demographic information, solely for the purpose of reconciling payments for third-party advertising), but we would not disclose details such as your name or contact information. You may be able to avoid targeted ads by certain ad networks by blocking cookies (see your browser‚Äôs ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù menu for information on how to do this); however, our Platform(s) may not work if you block or disable cookies.
reCAPTCHA.
We may use the reCAPTCHA service provided by Google Inc. (‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù) to protect your entries via internet submission forms on this site.
