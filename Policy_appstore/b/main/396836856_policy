Literally a lifesaver
by DanCasali
After a heart attack I really needed a good tool to determine the fat content of my diet.  Nutrients has a comprehensive, well tended and ever expanding database of nutrition info. It's easy to search and attractively presented. Its built in units conversion ability makes it simple to compare servings of like amounts of diverse foods. Best app for this purpose I could find, and I looked at a bunch.
Excellent source of information!

I am getting my bachelors in Nutrition and Dietetics so I am always looking up nutrition information. This is a beautiful, easy to use app that is full of nutritional information! I love it!
UNbelievable
by LU Soccer "Gilligan"
The previous version was well worth the money spent, but this update just blows me out of the water!! The added graphics (color coding, and vibrant colors) along with the vast added database of food items is UNbelievable! What a great tool for anyone to have, especially anyone in the health field assisting the public in making better decisions in health through nutrition!
Unreal!

An embarrassment of riches! The most thorough and complete nutrition atlas I have ever seen! If you want to know what you eat I strongly suggest this great app!
Best app ever
by Deen1stApps
Love it! The update is amazing. Very informative app. Especially if you are trying to eat healthier or get more of one type of nutrient. You can eat more of that type of food.

This is great! Having been in nursing and want to feed myself and family nutritious foods...this helps me a lot. Select what category I need before I leave to shop and it gives me a fine selection with the nutritional values. Now I'm retiring. The purpose it serves is to keep me in a healthy state. So if your Dr says you need a certain diet with certain vitamins minerals etc. this is the app for you. It even has how much is contained in these foods so you are aware. GREAT!!
Great!

Great app! Specially to nutritionist, when a patient ask for some random ingredient we don't know all its values! Works like a lucky charm!
Great app
by Dward4904
This app is very handy. It is great if you are looking for more than just calorie or fat content. You can look at the food to see its nutrition or you can search by nutrient to find which foods are the best sources.
Absolutely Amazing!! Nutrition Facts at Your Fingertips :)

User friendly-Love it!!
by BethTooch
My son is fed a blended diet of real food through a gtube. I need to keep close track of calories in the blends. This is my go to app for nutrition facts and calories. So easy to use and gets right to the point. I've tried other apps but always come back to this one because it's the quickest and simplest. Thank you!!
Great for diabetics

Being a type 1 diabetic, I have to count carbs in everything I eat. This app has made it easier to look up the nutrition information on many foods. Truly an amazing app!! Every diabetic should have this app.

iPhone's best food reference guide
by The Shazmeister
Finally an app that gives a complete nutritional breakdown of food. This holistic approach takes the focus off calories and back onto food as a whole. As a nutritionist I highly recommend it to all my clients.
