RULE ROUNDUP
Please familiarize yourself with  all game rules before playing. Failure to be familiar with the game rules is not an excuse for breaking them and will not be accepted as a defence of your account.
We reserve the right to ban any user who is violating these rules or anything set out in this Terms of Service.

Use any kind of program/script which automatically does actions or automates any other game activities.
Exploit a bug in the game to make money, gain properties, and or make harms to any other players, or to the game itself.
Bugs include unforeseen loopholes which give you an unfair advantage over other players. All such bugs must be reported help desk available within the help area of the game.
Abuse, bully or harass other players in the communication area. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban to your account.
Despite this, the theme and age rating of the game mean you should expect some belittling play and talk. Facilities are available to block and hide any unwanted communication.
Intentionally spam or flood the forum, chat room, or other communication methods.
Advertise any other website/product or any other material.
Please remember:
Users are ONLY allowed to access their own account. Sharing of accounts is not allowed. Logging on to someone else's account is not allowed.

If a user’s account gets hacked or accessed       by another player, GP is not responsible for the undoing of any results of       said hacking. This includes the return of any Money, Credits, Cars,       Properties and any other goods of GP, as well as, the un-banning of the account. Once reported, Administrators or Moderators may investigate and ban any users involved in said hacking.

18.  FORCE MAJEUERE
Gangster  Paradise shall not be held responsible for any  failure to perform its obligations under this Terms of Service (Connectivity,  loss of account information) if such failure is caused by events or conditions  beyond Gangster Paradise’s control.
19.  ADDENDUM
Other  sections of the game may have its own rules (such as the Chat Room, Game Forum.)  These rules are an addition to the Terms of Service, not a replacement.  Violation of these rules is considered to be a violation of the Terms of  Service and will be dealt with accordingly.
20.  PLAYER STAFF INTERACTION
Both  players and staff are expected to coexist in a polite and respectful  environment. This applies to professional interaction only, as there are  instances when the staff member is acting in the capacity of a player, and not  an administrator. This is not to say a staff member may become abusive and  claim they were acting in a player capacity, but it does mean a staff member  need not be stoic at all times. They're volunteers, and need to relax/get into  arguments too. This should never be the case in professional settings (i.e. Helpdesk  requests).
21.  COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
Since  people of diverse ages, backgrounds, religions, and nationalities play the  Service, it is expected that the players will refrain from speech that is  deliberately inflammatory, excessively vulgar, and/or personally derogatory. In  other words: No flaming and keep the "trash talk" to a minimum. This  applies to the general chat (public and private) as well as the messages  (public and private). Pushing excessive quantities of chat (public or private)  into the game, whether directed at the entire game or at a particular player is  considered spamming.
The  public chat and forums are strictly english, as the majority of the game population speak English as their primary language, and it is impossible to provide adequate moderation in every language.
In  addition, using the Service to promote the distribution of or access to warez,  MP3s, or other illegal software or products is strictly forbidden and will not  be tolerated.
Using  the Service to distribute pornography or access to pornography of any kind is  strictly forbidden and will not be tolerated.

Online Support
SMS purchases ONLY:
Credits may be purchased by users using the information provided within the "Credits" section of the app. This is optional and not a requirement or hidden cost. You must understand that payments are processed by our service provider
Fortumo
who can be contacted
here
. Any problem with a purchase should be brought to their attention. Any possible problems you experience before or after a purchase should be submitted to our ticket based support system (GP Support) under the "Credit Purchase Problem" category to be sent to the correct personnel. Upon following the instructions given in the Credits section of Gangster Paradise OR / AND additional methods of payments on the affiliated Fortumo website, a user will be provided with a password delivered from the Fortumo system. Fortumo will automatically post the password and purchase data to the Gangster Paradise database, allowing a user to enter the password provided into the Credits section and receive their in-game credits. This password can only be entered once by one user. Purchases are non-subscription based.
Credits are not required to use the service, however they provide additional virtual items, advancements or features that may benefit a user and enhance their experience. Due to the optional nature of the credits system, in a normal hourly session a user could use anywhere between 0 to around 100 credits, this being entirely dependent on if they've already purchased some of the in-game items available or are in need of the benefits at the time.
You agree that Gangster Paradise is only responsible for  providing adequate credits to the customer after a purchase. After a customer  receives his or her purchased credits, he/she is to be held fully responsible  for what is to become of the credits. You agree that Gangster Paradise will be  in no way responsible for (but is not limited to) the loss of credits due to  unauthorized access to your account.
Credits work on a no refund, no return policy. After the credits have been added to your account on the game you cannot claim a refund or return the credits for your money back. You are responsible for their safety.
You agree to not (re)sell Gangster Paradise credits for anything other than  in-game goods. Selling credits (regardless of how you received them) for real  money is prohibited, and will not be tolerated. You agree not to transfer credits  which will ultimately lead to you receiving real currency. You agree not to  purchase credits with real money from users other than those who officially  sell them.
You agree (and understand) that after a reset, you can claim 100% of your paid  for credits
IF
and only if you purchased them within 1 month of the  reset. In other words, your credits will only "roll over" to the next  round if a reset occurred within 1 month of purchasing your credits. After  that, they cannot be claimed.
We hope  you have fun playing the game
