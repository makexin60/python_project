Information Collection, Use and Sharing
Information You Provide
Users can browse our websites without logging in or providing any Personal Information, although we passively collect certain other information as described below. The IP address of your device is collected when you access the Services for the purposes of system administration, security, and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our affiliates or vendors. We do not combine IP addresses with any collected Personal Information, nor do we compile session activity reports by IP address. In addition, we currently do honor Do Not Track signals.

It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with such Personal Information. However, if you do not provide the necessary information you may not be able to access some or all of the features of the Services. We also will have no way to respond to your questions or inquiries.

ensure, as far as is practical, that our websites and applications are compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors

We use a third-party payment processor to facilitate payments for subscriptions, to make any purchase. You will be asked to provide certain financial information, such as a credit card number, debit card number, PayPal information, along with other Personal Information to verify and authorize the payment. The collection and process of this information by the payment processor is subject to their terms and policies.

Passive Collection of Information; Tracking Technologies
We gather certain information automatically when you access our websites and the Services. This information may include, but not be limited to, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We use this information for profiling purposes, such as tracking user's web browsing activities through cookies or other tracking technologies, in order to analyze user browsing behavior to provide and to improve the Services and to serve online behavioral advertising.
We use cookies on our websites. Cookies are used to improve functionality and your use of our websites, as well as for analytic and advertising purposes. Disabling cookies may hinder your ability to access and use our websites or Services.
In addition, we use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We use persistent cookies to assist us with the collection and use of de-identified browsing data, including IP address and Cookie ID to enable online behavioral advertising. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still navigate our websites, but your ability to use the Services may be limited.
This de-identified data includes, but is not limited to, information such as a web visitor's web pages which have been viewed by a web visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third-party advertising technology vendor. As the Internet evolves, we may use different types of technologies to collect these types of de-identified, non-personally identifiable information. The collection of this de-identified data allows us and our partners to better target advertising to user interests. The data also allows us to provide improvements to our services, for example, improving the effectiveness of the advertisements delivered to users and limiting the number of times a person sees a given advertisement. A further description of how we use online behavioral advertising is provided below.
We regularly conduct analytics activities on our websites and Services to determine their effectiveness and how they can be improved. For example, we use Google Analytics and other services to improve our operations. For more information about Google analytic cookies, please see
Google's help pages
. Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js). If you want to opt out of Google Analytics, you can download and install the add-on for your web browser at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

Online Behavioral Advertising
We use third party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve online behavioral advertising to you on our behalf when you access and use the Services. Our agreements with these third-party advertising networks specify that they may use certain non-personal information about your access and use of the Services (but not Personal Information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number) to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see the following website from the National Advertising Initiative (NAI):
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/
or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA):
http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/
.
As noted above, we employ cookies and other technologies, as well as work with third parties to provide online behavior advertising on our websites and Services, which strive to provide you with more targeted advertising choices. This service does not access or use your Personal Information, but rather data about your online viewing history is collected and analyzed anonymously. At any time, you can opt out of this service by going to the following link sponsored by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA):
http://www.youronlinechoices.com/
. Be advised, however, that not consenting to or opting out of online behavior advertising does not mean that you will not see advertising when you are online. It means only that the advertising you do see will be less relevant to your interests and choices.
