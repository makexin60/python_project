The elevator pitch about this application… ehm… two words! Poop Tracker.
OopsieWhoopsie uses the Bristol stool scale to be specific.
The Bristol stool scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human faeces into seven categories. Each category describes look of the faeces, which in turn could indicate constipation or inflammation when tracked over a period of time. This information can be used in both clinical and experimental studies.
This all may sounds complicated and unnecessary, but when your physician ask your about bowl movement, then the Bristol stool scale will be used. Because simply saying you have them is sometimes not enough for a proper health diagnosis.
More information like frequency (there is a difference between once a week to every day), time (every morning to irregular during the day or evening) and amount (infrequent with a large amount to frequent with small amounts).
OopsieWhoopsie will help you keep track of all this. All you have to do is make a log entry every time you visit the toilet.
