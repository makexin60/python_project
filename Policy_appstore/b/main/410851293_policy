9 Log files
Access data will be stored in a log file, the server log, for each page request. The record stored as a result contains the following data:
the IP address (through which the computer can be unambiguously identified),
the remote host (name and IP address of the computer that requests the page),
the time, the status, the quantity of data transferred and the internet page from which the user visited the requested page (referrer), as well as
the product and version information for the browser used (user agent).
Peakhunter.com uses the log data (logs) anonymously, and thus without correlation or reference to persons, for statistical analyses. As such, Peakhunter.com can learn, for example, on what days and at what times the offerings of the Peakhunter web site are particularly popular, and what volume of data is produced at the Peakhunter web site. In addition, Peakhunter.com can detect possible errors using the log files (broken links or program errors, for example) and thus use the log files for the development of the Peakhunter web site. Peakhunter.com does not associate the page requests and usage stored in the server log with individual persons. However, Peakhunter.com reserves the right to subsequently review the log files for the last known IP addresses of those members for whom, based on specific facts, the suspicion exists that they are using the Peakhunter web site and/or the Peakhunter.com services in a manner that is unlawful and/or in violation of the contract. This serves to protect both the members and the security of member data as well as the Peakhunter web site and the Peakhunter.com services.
In addition, each entry of and change to content by members is logged; this is also visible on the web site with the content.
