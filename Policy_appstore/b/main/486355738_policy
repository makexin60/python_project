For example, if you have applied for a product or raised a complaint with us.

How the law protects you
expandable section
This section sets out the legal reasons we rely on, for each of the ways we may use your personal information.
As well as our Privacy Promise, your privacy is protected by law. This section explains how that works.
What is 'personal information'?
'Personal information' means any information that we could use to identify you, directly or indirectly, and any information that relates to you.
Data Protection law only applies to personal information.
How can we use personal information?
Data Protection law says that we can use personal information only if we have a proper reason to do so. This includes sharing it outside Lloyds Banking Group. The law says we must have one or more of these reasons:
To fulfil a contract we have with you, or
When it is our legal duty, or
When it is in our legitimate interest, or
When you consent to it, or
When it is in the public interest.
When we have a business or commercial reason of our own to use your personal information, this is called a ‘legitimate interest’. We'll tell you what that is, if we are going to rely on it as the reason for using your personal information. Even then, it must not unfairly go against your interests.
You have the right to object to use of your personal information in this way. You can do this by telling us anything that we may need to consider, to understand if our use of your personal information is fair. Please see the ‘
Your data privacy rights
’ section for more information.
The law and other regulations treat some types of sensitive personal information as special. This personal information is called ‘special categories of personal information’. We won't collect or use these types of personal information without your consent unless the law allows us to do so. If we do, it will only be when it is necessary:
For reasons of substantial public interest, or
To establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
Here is a list of all the ways that we may use your personal information, and which of the reasons we rely on to do so. This is also where we tell you what our legitimate interests are, where it is the reason for using your personal information.
We may rely on different reasons for using the same personal information, as this depends on the situation. For example, we may use your personal information to make an automated decision about you. This could be because of a legal duty, or to fulfil a contract we’ve made with you.

Cookie Policy
.
Data from outside organisations

Credit reference agencies such as TransUnion, Equifax and Experian.

Employers. For example, to get a reference if you apply for a mortgage.
Payroll service providers.
Land agents, such as firms who do property valuations for mortgages.
Public information sources such as the Electoral Register, Companies House, published media and social media. For example, to confirm what you’ve told us

Market researchers - these firms may get in touch with you on our behalf to ask you for your opinions and feedback. Sometimes these firms will combine what you tell them with data from other sources to study it. They’ll use this to help us understand our customers’ point of view, so we can improve the way we work as a business.

How long we keep your personal information
expandable section
This section explains how long we may keep your personal information for and why.
We will keep your personal information for as long as you have a product or are using a service from us, and in most situations, for up to 7 years after. The reasons we may do this are:
To respond to a question or complaint, or to show whether we gave you fair treatment.
To understand our customers as part of our own internal research.
To obey rules that apply to us about keeping records.
We may keep your personal information for longer than 7 years if we archive it for historical purposes or if we can’t delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons. For example, we have to hold pension transfer information indefinitely.
We’ll only use your personal information for those purposes and will make sure that your privacy is protected.
If you choose not to give personal information
expandable section
You can choose not to give us personal information. In this section, we explain the effects this may have.
We may need to collect personal information by law, or to enter into or fulfil a contract we have with you.
If you choose not to give us this personal information, it may delay or prevent us from fulfilling our contract with you, or doing what we must do by law. It may also mean that we can’t run your products or services. It could mean we cancel a product or service you have with us.
We sometimes ask for personal information that is useful, but not needed by law or a contract. We’ll make this clear when we ask for it. You don’t have to give us these extra details, and it won't affect the products or services you have with us.
Cookies and similar tracking technologies
expandable section
This section explains how we use data on our websites, apps and emails.
We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our websites and apps, and in emails we send you.
Cookies
Cookies are small computer files that get sent to your computer, tablet or mobile device by websites when you visit them. They stay on your device, so that when you visit the website again, it knows that you have been there before and can give you a better experience. Cookies store information about your visits to that website, such as your choices, the type of device you use to connect to it, where you were when you connected, and the pages you visited on that site. Even where this information does not have personal details about you or your business, it is still protected by this Privacy Notice.
Email and SMS Tracking
We review how you interact with emails we send you by using small images that you cannot see called ‘pixels’ within our emails. These pixels allow us to capture some information about emails we’ve sent you, such as:
When you opened the email,
How many times you opened it, and
The device you used to open it.
This is called ‘email tracking’. We use this information to help us understand how effective our emails are, and to improve our communications with you.
We also place trackers on SMS messages we send that capture similar information: whether you’ve received the message, and whether you’ve opened it. We use this information for the same reasons as above.
To find out more about how we use cookies and email tracking, please see our
Cookie Policy

How personal information is used
Who we share your personal information with
expandable section
We may share your personal information with other companies in the Lloyds Banking Group. We may also share it with outside organisations such as credit card providers, insurers or tax authorities. This is so that we can provide you with products and services, run our business, and obey rules that apply to us. Here we list all the types of organisations that we may share your personal information with.
Lloyds Banking Group
We may share your personal information with other companies in the Lloyds Banking Group. These companies may use different brand names. For details of our brands, please see the ‘
Who we are
’ section.
We share the information to make sure our records are accurate. For example, if you hold products with different brands in the Group, and you update your information with one of them, we may share this information with the other brands you hold products with.
We also share the information to help us provide you with products and services. For example, we could use information we learn about you from your transaction history with one of our brands to support an insurance product application with another brand.
Third parties who help us provide products or services
We work with third parties outside of the Lloyds Banking Group who provide products or services under our brand names. If you apply for one of these products, we may share information about you with the third party. If we want to share information in this way, we, or the third party will tell you before we do so.

Companies you ask us to share your data with

Companies whose shares we hold for you in one of our nominee companies
- This is where we hold shares for you in the name of our nominee company, and that company or their agent asks us to share details of the beneficial owner of the shares with them.
Insurers
We share personal information with insurance industry companies to process claims and help reduce fraud. We do that in these ways:
If you apply for insurance through us, we may pass your personal or business details to the insurer.
If you apply for insurance with us as the insurer, we may share your personal or business details with reinsurers.
If you make an insurance claim, information you give to us or the insurer may be put on a register of claims. This will be shared with other insurers, our agents, suppliers and sub-contractors. In some cases we may also share it with our business partners, if you also have a relationship with them.
Other services and schemes
These are organisations that we may need to share your personal information with, because of what you can do with the product or service you have with us.
If you have a debit, credit or charge card with us, we will share transaction details with companies that help us to provide this service (such as Visa and Mastercard). We need to do this to keep your account balance and statements up to date, for example.
If you use Direct Debits, we’ll share your data with the Direct Debit scheme.
If you have a product that has a loyalty scheme, we will share your data with that scheme.
If you have a product with benefits such as travel insurance or discount offers, we will share your data with the benefit providers. We may also share it with other companies involved in how you use the service, such as a private car park operator.
If you have a secured loan or mortgage with us, we may share information with other lenders who also hold a charge on the property, such as the other party in a shared ownership scheme.
If you or your employer have a product with us that includes extra services or features, such as daily rental vehicles, we'll share your data with the providers of those services or features.
If a third party contacts us about fines, penalties or charges imposed on you, we may share this with your employer, or share your details with these third parties.
If we carry out driving licence, vehicle or any other checks as part of our products, services or features, we may share information with suppliers and other third parties needed for us to provide those to you, or your employer.
General business
Outside companies we use to provide our services, help grow and improve our business.
Agents, suppliers, sub-contractors and advisers - These are types of firms that we use to help us run accounts, policies and services.
Companies we have a contractual arrangement, joint venture or agreement with - This could be a store, a manufacturer or a broker who is offering finance deals or other products, services or features through us.
Organisations that introduce you to us - This might be a store or car dealership that offers finance deals through us, or a price comparison website.
Market researchers – These firms may get in touch with you on our behalf to ask you for your opinions and feedback. Sometimes these firms will combine what you tell them with data from other sources to study it. They’ll use this to help us understand our customers’ point of view, so we can improve the way we work as a business.
Advisers who help us to come up with new ways of doing business - This might be a legal firm, IT supplier or consultancy.
Advertisers and technology providers that you use, such as websites you visit, social media, and providers of apps and smart devices. This is so that:
You are only shown marketing we think you might be interested in.
You are not shown marketing we think you won’t be interested in.
We can try to find new customers who are like you, or have similar interests to yours.
Learn more about
how we use your information to make automated decisions
.
Outside companies you may use
This could include:
Price comparison websites and similar companies
- We only do so if you buy something from us through such a company. We only share details needed to confirm what you have bought, to fulfil our own contract with the company.
Third party payment providers
. For example, if you use an app on your phone to pay for something, then we may share payment and transaction data with them - This includes the amount, type, location, origin and recipients.
Company mergers, and takeovers and transfers of products or services
We may also share your personal information if the ownership of products or services or the make-up of Lloyds Banking Group changes in the future:
We may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business, or our assets, including products or services. Or we may try to bring other businesses into Lloyds Banking Group - This is sometimes called Mergers and Acquisitions or ‘company takeovers’.
During any such process, we may share your data with other parties involved. We’ll only do this if they agree to keep your data safe and private.
If the change to our Group happens, then other parties may use your data in the same way as set out in this notice.
Sharing information that doesn’t reveal your identity
We may share or sell some information to other companies outside Lloyds Banking Group, but only when we have removed any personal details, so that no-one’s identity can be known or found out.
We and those other companies do this to help them learn about the types of customers they have, how customers use their products, and how their products perform. It also helps us to learn about the markets we each operate in and how our competitors perform. The law says data is not considered to be personal information after customer identities have been removed.
One of the ways we can share information without revealing customers' identities is by grouping customers' information together. Companies can use this grouped customer information to look for general patterns and trends in the information, without knowing individual customer identities. For example, we might provide them with information about:
types of customers in a specific location shopping for clothes
customers that fall into a particular age group, or live in a particular area
patterns of spending habits, such as the average amount spent in one month
To create this information, we analyse all of the details we hold about you and other customers. This includes information about your current and past products and services you have with us.
How we work out what marketing you receive
expandable section
This section tells you how we decide what marketing to show or send you. It also explains how we work out what you may be interested in.
We may use your personal information to make decisions about what products, services and offers we think you may be interested in. This is what we mean when we talk about ‘marketing’. We may send you carefully selected messages on products and offers from ourselves, other companies within Lloyds Banking Group and selected third parties.
When we can use your personal information for marketing
We can only use your personal information to send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a ‘legitimate interest’. That is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your personal information. It must not conflict unfairly with your own interests.
How we decide what marketing may interest you
The personal information we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and data we collect when you use our services, or from outside organisations we work with. We study this to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.
We use the information to understand what kind of things you like, special events in your life, and how you react to different kinds of marketing material.
This is called profiling for marketing purposes. It helps us to decide what products, services and offers we can promote to you. We may also conduct profiling for other purposes – please see 'Tailoring products and services' under 'How we use your information to make automated decisions' for further information.
You can contact us at any time and ask us to stop using your personal information this way. Please see the ‘
Your data privacy rights
’ section for more information, and the ‘
How to contact us
’ section to contact us about this.
How we send you marketing
We may show or send you marketing material online (on our own and other websites including social media), in our own and other apps, or by email, mobile phone, post or through smart devices and other digital channels.
Your marketing choices
You can tell us to stop sending you marketing at any time. Whatever you choose, we’ll still send you statements and other important information such as changes to your existing products and services.
You can also tell us not to collect your personal information for marketing purposes while you are using our websites or mobile apps. If you do, you may still see some marketing, but it may not be tailored to you. See our
Cookie Policy
for details about how we use this information to improve our websites and mobile apps.
We may ask you to confirm or update your choices, if you take out any new products or services with us in the future. We’ll also ask you to do this if there are changes in the law, regulation or the structure of our business.
If you change your mind, you can contact us to update your choices at any time. Please see the ‘
Your data privacy rights
’ section for more information, and the ‘
How to contact us
’ section to contact us about this.
How we use your personal information to make automated decisions
expandable section
Here we tell you how we use automated systems to make decisions about you and your money. We also explain your right to challenge decisions made this way.
We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions about you or your business. This helps us to make sure our decisions are quick, fair, efficient and correct, based on what we know. Automated decisions can affect the products, services or features we may offer you now or in the future, or the price we charge for them. They are based on personal information that we have or that we are allowed to collect from others.
Some of our systems learn from this information to make sure our automated decisions stay accurate and fair. This is sometimes known as ‘artificial intelligence’ or ‘machine learning’.
Here are the types of automated decisions we make:
Pricing
We may decide what to charge for some products and services based on what we know. For example, if you use our online mortgage calculator, it will use the personal financial details you put in to estimate the kind of mortgage we may offer you. If you apply for insurance, we’ll compare what you tell us with other records to work out how likely you are to make a claim. This will help us to decide whether to offer you the product and what price to charge you.
Tailoring products and services
The personal information we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and information we collect when you use our services, or from outside organisations we work with. We study this to form a view on what we think you may do, want, or need. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.
Profiling for other non-marketing purposes
Sometimes we use your personal information to create a profile about you, for purposes other than marketing or making automated decisions about you. This means we build up a picture over time of your tastes, and things we think you may need, want or do based on how you interact with us. This may be changed into a ‘score’ or number we add to your record with us.
We use this information to place you in groups with similar customers. These are called customer segments. We use these to study and learn about our customers’ needs. It helps us to design different products, services and offers for different customer segments, and to manage our relationships with them. It also helps us tailor what individuals see on our own and other websites and mobile apps, including social media.
We also use customer segments from outside companies we work with, such as social media. We ask them for groups of people who are like you, or have interests that are like yours in some ways. These companies help us look for new customers who may be interested in products, services or offers that our existing customers are interested in.
You can ask us to stop using your information in this way. Please see the ‘
Your data privacy rights
’ section, and the ‘
How to contact us
’ section for details about how to do this.
Detecting fraud
We use your personal information to help decide if your personal or business accounts may be being used for fraud or money-laundering. We may detect that an account is being used in ways that fraudsters work. Or we may notice that an account is being used in a way that is unusual for you or your business. If we think there is a risk of fraud, we may stop activity on the accounts or refuse access to them.
Opening accounts
When you open an account with us, we check that the product or service is relevant for you, based on what we know. We also check that you or your business meet the conditions needed to open the account. This may include checking age, residency, nationality or financial position. It may mean we can’t offer you the account you want.
Approving credit
We use a system to decide whether to lend money to you or your business, when you apply for credit such as a loan or credit card. This is called credit scoring. It uses past data to assess how you’re likely to act while paying back any money you borrow. This includes data about similar accounts you may have had before.
Credit scoring uses data from three sources:
Your application form
Credit reference agencies
Data we may already hold.
It gives an overall assessment based on this. Banks and other lenders use this to help us make responsible lending decisions that are fair and informed.
Credit scoring methods are tested regularly to make sure they are fair and unbiased.
This credit score can determine whether we'll give you credit or allow you to take another product or service.
Your rights
You can object to an automated decision we have made and ask that a person reviews it.
If you want to know more about these rights, please see the ‘
Your data privacy rights
’ section for more information, and the ‘
How to contact us
’ section to contact us about this.
Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs)
expandable section
This section explains how we work with outside companies to decide whether to lend you money through products like credit cards or loans. It also explains how we manage our products during your relationship with us. It explains what we do and why we do it.
We carry out credit and identity checks when you apply for a product or services for you or your business. We may use Credit Reference Agencies to help us with this.
We’ll go on sharing your personal information with CRAs during your relationship with us. From time to time, we may also search information that the CRAs have to help us manage your accounts.
We’ll share your personal information with CRAs and they’ll give us information about you. The data we exchange can include:
Name, address and date of birth
Credit application
Details of any shared credit
Financial situation and history
Fraud prevention information
We’ll use this data to:
Assess whether you or your business is able to afford to make repayments
Make sure what you’ve told us is true, correct and up to date
Help detect and prevent financial crime
Manage your accounts with us
Trace and recover debts
Make sure any offers are relevant for you.
This will include details of money going into the account, and the account balance. If you borrow, it will also include details of your repayments, and whether you repay in full and on time. We’ll also tell the CRAs when you settle your accounts with us. The CRAs may give this information to other organisations that want to check your credit status.
When we ask CRAs about you or your business, they’ll note it on your credit file. This is called a credit search. Other lenders may see this and we may see credit searches from other lenders.
If you apply for a product with someone else, we’ll link your records with theirs. We’ll do the same if you tell us you have a spouse, partner or civil partner – or that you are in business with other partners or directors.
You should tell them about this before you apply for a product or service. It’s important that they know your records will be linked together, and that credit searches may be made on them.
CRAs will also link your records together. These links will stay on your files unless one of you asks the CRAs to break the link. You’ll normally need to give proof that you no longer have a financial link with each other.
You can find out more about the CRAs on their websites, in the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN). This includes details about:
Who they are
Their role as fraud prevention agencies
The data they hold and how they use it
How they share personal information
How long they can keep data
Your data protection rights.
Here are links to the information notice for each of the three main Credit Reference Agencies:
TransUnion
Equifax
Experian
We use these agencies mainly with UK, Isle of Man or EEA products and customers. For non-UK, Isle of Man or EEA products and customers, we may not use these agencies. We may instead use other regional CRAs. Please see the ‘
How to contact us
’ section if you’d like to speak to us about this.
Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs)
expandable section
This section deals with information we share outside our group to help fight financial crime. This includes crimes such as fraud, money-laundering and terrorist financing.
We may need to confirm your identity before we provide products or services to you or your business. This may include carrying out fraud checks at the point of sale.
Once you have become a customer of ours, we'll share your personal information as needed to help combat fraud and other financial crime. The organisations we share data with are:
Registered Fraud Prevention Agencies
Other agencies and bodies acting for the same purpose
Industry databases used for this purpose
Insurers
Throughout our relationship with you, we and these organisations exchange data to help prevent, deter, detect and investigate fraud and money-laundering.
We and these organisations can’t use your personal information unless we have a proper reason to do so. It must be needed either for us to obey the law, or for a ‘legitimate interest’.
When we have a business or commercial reason of our own to use your personal information, this is called a ‘legitimate interest’. We'll tell you what that is, if we are going to rely on it as the reason for using your personal information. Even then, it must not unfairly go against your interests.
We'll use the personal information to:
Confirm identities
Help prevent fraud and/or money-laundering
Fulfil any contracts you or your business has with us.
We or an FPA may allow law enforcement agencies to access your personal information. This is to support their duty to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute crime.
These other organisations can keep personal information for different lengths of time, up to six years.
The information we use
These are some of the kinds of personal information that we use:
Name
Date of birth
Residential address
History of where you have lived
Contact details, such as email addresses and phone numbers
Financial data
Whether you have been a victim of fraud
Data about insurance claims you have made
Data about your or your business’s products or services
Employment details
Vehicle details
Data that identifies the computers or other devices you use to connect to the internet. This includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
Automated decisions for fraud prevention
The information we have for you or your business is made up of what you tell us, and data we collect when you use our services, or from third parties we work with.
We and other organisations acting to prevent fraud may process your personal information in systems that look for fraud by studying patterns in the data. We may find that an account or policy is being used in ways that fraudsters work. Or we may notice that an account is being used in a way that is unusual for you or your business. Either of these could indicate a risk of fraud or money-laundering against a customer, the bank or the insurer.
How this can affect you
If we or an FPA decide there is a risk of fraud, we may stop activity on the accounts or block access to them. FPAs and cross-industry organisations may also keep a record of the risks that you or your business may pose.
This may result in other organisations refusing to provide you with products or services, or to employ you.
Data transfers out of the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA
FPAs and other organisations we share data with for these purposes may send personal information to countries outside the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and European Economic Area (‘EEA’). This may include countries where the UK Government has decided that your data will be protected to UK standards. If the data is sent to another type of country, the FPAs or other organisations will make sure your data stays protected to the same standard as the EEA by making sure appropriate safeguards are in place. This may include following international frameworks for making data sharing secure.
The main Fraud Prevention Agency we use, CIFAS, has published more information about data transfers:

Sending data outside of the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA
expandable section
This section tells you about the safeguards that keep your personal information safe and private, if it is sent outside the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and European Economic Area (EEA).
We'll only send your data outside of the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA to:
Follow your instructions - For example, if you book a hotel in Australia with your Lloyds Banking Group card we will send your details necessary to fulfil that payment to the hotel’s bank.
Comply with a legal duty - For example, we share information about US citizens with the US tax authority.
Work with our suppliers who help us to run your accounts and services.
If we do transfer your personal information outside the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA to our suppliers, we'll make sure that it is protected to the same extent as in the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA. We’ll use one of these safeguards:
Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA. Learn more on the
European Commission Justice website
.
Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA. Read more about this here on the
European Commission Justice website
