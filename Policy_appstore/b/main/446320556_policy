Golf Pad, Inc. Privacy Policy
Last updated:
August 22, 2021
Introduction
Golf Pad, Inc. Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the information, and help you make informed decisions when using Golf Pad GPS™ application and website. By using or accessing Golf Pad GPS™, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
What information is collected
When you purchase Golf Pad GPS™ application or register or sign in within the application or use the Golf Pad GPS website, Golf Pad TAGS™ or Golf Pad LINK™, Golf Pad, Inc. collects information that may include your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, login name, and more.
Golf Pad, Inc. may provide you with an option to connect via Facebook, through our website or application. If you log into Facebook, Golf Pad, Inc. will request permission to access your basic information, which includes your name, profile picture, gender, user id, and any other information that you have made public on Facebook. For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Privacy Policy.
Finally Golf Pad GPS™ application routinely collects information required for its regular operation, such as location, scoring, course selections, device details, and more.
Background location access
Golf Pad GPS™ application requests background location permission to provide accurate rangefinder distances without delay. When the option is enabled, the application keeps phone's GPS sensor active during the round, so location reading is always current and accurate. Whenever you glance at the phone screen to check the distance to the green, you will see the actual correct distance right away.
You may choose instead to only grant location access
'while using the app'
, Golf Pad will continue to work. However it will take some time to re-acquire current location whenever you resume the app to check distances during a golf round, and even longer to get the most accurate GPS reading. Additionally, Golf Pad will not be able to continuously update distances on smartwatches, or compute statistics like
distance walked
.
Golf Pad DOES NOT use background location unless you are playing a round of golf using the application.
Use of information
We use the information to operate Golf Pad GPS application and website, for internal business operations and to respond to your support requests in a timely fashion. From time to time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities, and deliver promotion emails or messages to Golf Pad users on their behalf.
