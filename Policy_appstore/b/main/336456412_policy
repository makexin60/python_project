HoursTracker Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the HoursTracker app for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.
Information we collect
The data you enter into HoursTracker, such as your jobs or time entries, stays on your device and in any personal backups you create, such as a cloud backup of your phone.
    This information is not collected by us or transmitted to us or to any other party besides the company where your backups are stored (e.g. Apple iCloud, or Google), and
    we do not have access to any of it unless you decide to sign up for the HoursTracker Cloud service.
If you do sign up for HoursTracker Cloud, we will
    send the username and password you choose to sign up with to HoursTracker Cloud in order to identify you and your data. Data may then be uploaded from your device to
    HoursTracker Cloud systems in accordance with the
HoursTracker Cloud Privacy Policy.
Location Data
If you opt into HoursTracker's Location Awareness features, HoursTracker will use your location to enable features such as automatic clock in and clock out when you arrive and depart the location set
    up for each Job. Your location will be used even while you are not using HoursTracker, but HoursTracker does not save or share your live location. HoursTracker uses the live location to compare it 
    to the job's location and radius. If your live location is within the job's location area, HoursTracker may clock in that job automatically, depending on your chosen options. HoursTracker will record that the clock in occurred due to the live location being within the job's location area,
    but it does not record your actual live location. If you choose to upload data to our optional HoursTracker Cloud service, that data will include the locations you set for each job, but no live locations from your device.
Ads and analytics

HoursTracker also collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features or which system software version they are using, to help improve the app.
Information Usage
