Privacy
The National Public Toilet Map complies with the Australian Privacy Principles and is designed to provide a balance of functionality and privacy. We need to know some information about our users (mainly about their computer and Web browser) to provide the service.
No attempt will be made to identify anonymous users or their use of the Toilet Map unless legally compelled to do so, such as in the event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider's log files.
Privacy statement
The National Public Toilet Map collects the following information that is used to help us deliver the service:
What you searched for, including your preferences
Where you searched, including your current location if permitted
Any results returned
Device information — e.g. your Web browser and operating system versions or your phone type and screen size.
This data will be used by ourselves and our agents to manage and improve the Toilet Map. This is marked as non-identifiable so there is no reasonable way for the site to identify the individual person this data was collected from.
All your personal data - Preferences, saved Facilities and Current location – is stored on your device in session or local storage. You can clear the data saved on your device at any time.
Our website also uses Google Analytics which is a service offered by Google that generates detailed statistics about our website's traffic and traffic sources. Google's privacy policy can be found at
