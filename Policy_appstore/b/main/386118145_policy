System Monitor
System Monitor is a complete iPhone/iTouch/iPad monitoring App, that lets you know about the current memory in use and free.
Memory usage
This shows you information about used and free memory and it also frees your memory when ever it is opened (for all device models), or brought into focus. So if your are running in low memory, your apps will crash frequently and you have to restart your phone to solve this. Now with System Monitor App, you just open this app and select memory tab, you will see the App frees memory for you.
Battery usage
Lets you know about the battery level and gives you detailed view about how long you could use your device without recharging based on your battery health. It also allow you to specify your battery health.
Realtime graph
Real time graphs helps you identify the spikes caused by any of the Apps. They provide a real time view of the memory usage by your iOS device. Shows the real time break up of 'Wired', 'Active', 'Free', and 'Inactive' memory. Flexible time scale axis view.
Disk space used
Provides pie chart that shows the total, used and free disk space. Disk space is the storage memory where your apps, music and other files gets stored, your device may have 16GB/32GB/64GB/128GB of disk space.
System information
Lets you know about your device's unique id, MAC address, IP Address, device name and model, OS Version, and Bus Frequency and your device's last boot time i.e. last time when you switched on your device.
What people are saying
Don't just take our word for it!
We think System Monitor is the best utility out there for monitoring the iPhone, and we think you will too!
Just 5 * thumbs up

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ITOUCH/IPHONE INFO CHECKER IVE EVER USED!!!! IT WORKS SO WELL!! WITH COOOL SOUND EFFECT TOO!?... you guys outdid yourselves...

The user interface is admittedly attractive ... but ultimately it's a lipstick gizmo. The memory graph is impressive (large and a very likely energy hog all by itself if you leave it running in the background) .. although the whole app is only a 13.1 MB program. Battery information is already at the upper right corner of your  phone screen so who needs a huge full page battery infographic (that you can choose the colors)?? The other boring system information is readily available within your settings and doesn't beg to be monitored. Maybe this app is a plus for somebody else but it's not a must-have for me. I'll be deleting it soon and moving along .. without prejudice though. üç≠üëÄ ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
NOPE ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø NOPE
Clean and simple interface. Totally free, has memory usage feature.

This App is a gem and provides extremely useful information about my device all in one place, though I can get it from Apple‚Äôs phone settings or other places on the website. The information is so wonderfully organised that I can see all of it one place about by iPad and iPhone, starting from hardware specs to motion processor and camera details. As stated in the description, the App also helps me to free memory by dismissing unused apps and leaving the System monitor open in the home screen for a few seconds ! Useful battery tips as well.

It's not a must-have app, but it's very nicely done and has some useful info, some of which might be hard (or impossible?) to find otherwise. There are a few places where the UX fails, such as when the storage FREE percentage is next to the word "USED".

what does the u.s. iTunes app store have against system optimizer apps, system memory refreshing apps, & battery boosting apps? seriously! every time i find one that does it all, inevitably the app store phases it out. these types of utilities are readily available in every other store, but not in the u.s. store. it's as though apple doesn't want it's customers to be able to enjoy the benefits of this type of utility, and they don't have the right to decide that for their customers. (and yet they have done just that) hasn't anyone out there noticed this? i cannot be the only person.

If your iPhone is running slow, or is hanging up while playing Risk or Monoploy, punch up this excellent app which mimics the gadget on Windows 7.  Instantly know by easy-to-read dials when to free memory, etc! Then you can use whatever memory-freeing app you have to speed up your system! Cool!
