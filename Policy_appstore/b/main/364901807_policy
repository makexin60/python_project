Air Gestures
The App offers an Air Gestures mode within its video player, allowing you to control the player solely through hand gestures, without requiring touch input. Please note that upon closing the App, the Air Gestures mode will deactivate automatically. You will need to manually re-enable this feature in the video player’s settings after reopening the App.
For this feature to function, we will request access to your device’s camera. The camera will be active while the Air Gestures mode is enabled within the video player. Upon exiting the video player, the Air Gestures mode will be temporarily paused.
The Air Gestures utilizes Apple's framework technology to facilitate hand gesture recognition. The technology functions by detecting hand-raising gestures and analyzing the hand pose and the fingers' coordinates within the captured images. Apple then provides the coordinates of your fingers to the App, which processes this data to execute specific commands, such as pausing a video, etc.
Our App does not utilize your data for learning purposes. Additionally, we do not retain or back up any finger coordinates, hand gestures, or other images when the feature is on. These coordinates are processed exclusively on your device and are automatically deleted once the processing is complete.

Audio/Video Transcribe
The App offers Audio/Video Transcribe feature to transcribe speech into the written text.
By default, this feature is turned off and can be enabled via the file's context menu. Upon its first use, the app downloads the AI model required for this functionality from Apple's servers. The transcription algorithm operates directly on your device, ensuring that no data is collected or transmitted externally. After the transcription process is completed, the model stops running. Additionally, any service data generated by the model during transcription is immediately erased once the App saves the text file with the transcription results (this includes the extracted audio file if you transcribe a video). The model is subsequently stored on your device and can be used again for transcribing audio or video files through the file's context menu whenever needed.
We do not utilize the user’s data for learning purposes and do not retain or back up any transcription data when the Audio/Video Transcribe feature is on.
Occasionally, the AI model may make errors in transcription, particularly with languages other than English or when the audio clarity is poor. Additionally, the model does not have restrictions on transcribing content that includes obscenities or various speech styles.

Smart Eraser
The App offers the Smart Eraser feature to remove unwanted objects from the images.
By default, this feature is turned off. Upon its first use, the App downloads the AI model required for this functionality. The algorithm operates directly on your device, ensuring that no data is collected or transmitted externally. It accesses and processes only the image you explicitly choose. Once the erasure process is completed, the model stops running. It is subsequently stored on your device and can be used again through the menu whenever needed.
The feature does not intentionally restrict the size, format, or content of the images it processes. However, there are unspecified technical limitations on the maximum allowable image size, which depend on the characteristics of a particular device and cannot always be predicted.
The output is always saved as a copy of the original file. Also, the output file format will be preserved only for jpeg, png, or heiс files. All other formats will be converted and saved as jpeg.
Occasionally, the AI model may make errors. The model is sensitive to how an object for erasing has been masked, and it tends to produce both good and bad results depending on the input.
We do not use the user’s data for learning purposes and do not retain or back up any images when the feature is on.
