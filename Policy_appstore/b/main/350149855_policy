Modern Slavery Statement
This Privacy Statement applies to the processing of personal data collected and used by members of the
Knight Frank Group
, which may be subject to change from time to time, and third-party service providers. The use of “Knight Frank,” “us” or “we” shall, herein, mean Knight Frank LLP and those members of the Knight Frank Group which it wholly or majority owns on behalf of whom this Statement is made. Further detail of how we are structured can be found
here
.
This Group Privacy Statement explains what personal data we hold, how we collect it, and how we use and may share information about you. It also contains important information about your rights in relation to your personal data, and how to contact us or supervisory authorities in the event that you have a complaint. This Privacy Statement applies to your use of the Knight Frank websites and/or mobile applications or when you otherwise provide your personal data to Knight Frank, for example, if you are looking to buy, sell or rent a property.
Knight Frank is a global business and given deviations in local data protection laws and requirements, our local offices may maintain country specific Privacy Statements, accessible via their websites. In the event of any inconsistencies between processing arrangements outlined in a country specific Privacy Statement and this Group Privacy Statement, the provisions of the country specific Privacy Statement shall take precedence.
What is personal data?
Personal data is any information that relates to an individual. This includes separate pieces of information that, when merged, reveals your identity. We may collect information about you from a variety of sources. This includes information we collect directly from you, information we collect when you visit our sites, a local branch, other property portals or, when you create an account on our website, view our online content, use our mobile applications or other services; and information we collect about you from other third-party sources.
Where we determine the purposes and means of the data processing, we will be acting as the data Controller. This is the case for most of the services provided to you by Knight Frank. Should you have any queries in respect of this Privacy Statement or our use of personal data or if you would like to exercise any of your data subject rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
dataprotection@knightfrank.com

We will only share your personal data when we are allowed to do so under data protection law.
Information sharing with third-parties, including service providers
We engage third-party service providers to perform a variety of business operations on our behalf. In doing so, we may share your personal data with them. We may also share data with third-parties who are working in conjunction with us to provide services to you, but only where we have lawful basis for sharing.
We will only share personal data which is necessary for the proper performance of the services being provided to Knight Frank. We contractually require third-parties to protect shared information appropriately and not use it for any other purpose.

When required by law, court order and/or government authorities which might include background checks (such as credit reference checks through agencies, or fulfilling other regulatory purposes); or

Links to Third-Party Sites and Social Media
Our Sites may provide links to other websites and apps for your convenience and information. These websites and apps may operate independently from us. Linked sites and apps may have their own Privacy Statements or policies, which we strongly recommend you review. To the extent any linked websites or apps are not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for their content, any use of the websites or apps, or the privacy practices of the websites or apps.
Social Networks and Third-Party Plug-ins
Our websites may include plugins from social networks or other third parties. An example of a plugin is the Facebook “Like” button. Where legally permitted, these plugins may communicate with and send information to the party that provided the plugin, even if you do not click on the plugin. This information may include your IP address, information about your browser and device, and the address of the web page you are visiting on our site. Loading, using, or clicking the plugins may also place, read, and transmit cookies. These cookies may contain a unique identifier the social network or third party assigns to you. The loading, functionality and your use of the plugins are governed by the Privacy Statement and terms of the party that provided the plugin.
Please remember that any information you submit or post as user-generated content to Social Media sites become public information, Knight Frank is not responsible for the results of such postings. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal, financial, or other information in such submissions or posts. Knight Frank cannot prevent others from using such information in a manner that may violate this.
How do we keep your personal data secure?
When you provide us with your Personal Data, we will process it using our systems, meaning your details will be inputted into our secure databases. We have appropriate security measures in place to help ensure that your data is not lost, stolen, accessed by unauthorised third parties, or tampered with in any way. Internally, your personal data will only be accessible by those members of our staff that have a need to see your data (which will depend on the nature of the services we are providing to you). However, we cannot guarantee your personal data will be free from every security risk that may be possible when your information is sent to and from the website or the app.
Legitimate interests
We may process your personal data for other legitimate interests outside of the delivery of our services to you where we have a lawful basis to do so including, but not limited to:
Satisfying contractual obligations with our clients and customers.
Recovering money owed to us.
Ensuring the safety and security of individuals such as residents and staff members.
Ensuring the safety and security of property owned or managed by Knight Frank or our clients.
Promoting the business and our services.
Effective internal administration.

To market services to you.
If you have previously purchased products and/or services from us, we may send you emails about similar products or service from the Knight Frank Group which we think will interest you, unless you have opted out of such emails. This is based on our legitimate interest in promoting our business and to provide you with information about relevant products and services. If you change your mind about this, you can stop us sending you such emails at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email. If you choose to stop receiving these marketing emails, we will still send you emails that are necessary for our relationship with you relating to the service we provide.
Failing to provide your personal data
Most of the personal data we collect from you is so that we can provide effective services to you. Some of the information we collect is to fulfil our legal and contractual obligations. Failing to provide personal data when requested may mean that we are unable to provide the service to you and fulfil our legal obligations, and you may be unable to exercise your contractual or statutory rights.
Retention of personal data
We will only retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Generally, we will retain your personal data where:
we are providing services relating to you;
we are in communication with you; or
a longer retention period applies (for example, for legal or regulatory reasons).
This is so we can:
communicate with you about any questions or complaints you may have after you have stopped being a user of our services; or
to comply with the rules on accounting, reporting or other law; or
to provide you with relevant information about products and services that you may be interested in.
Where you apply for a role with us and your application is unsuccessful we will retain your personal information for limited period after we have informed you of our decision so that we can show that we have not discriminated against you on prohibited grounds.
We may retain your personal data on our file for an extended period thereafter, so that we can consider you for future opportunities within Knight Frank. If you would prefer we did not, please email us at
dataprotection@knightfrank.com
.
Transfers of personal data to third countries
We may, in certain circumstances, transfer the Personal Data we collect about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected, including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK). Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information, however, we will ensure we have put adequate measures in place to protect your personal data to an equivalent standard of protection as in the EEA and UK.
Your rights
You may have certain rights in relation to the personal information we collect about you. Knight Frank respects those rights in accordance with the respective data privacy legislation which applies to you or in the capacity of your relationship with Knight Frank.
Not all rights will be applicable in every case; for example, where we are obliged to maintain records to meet a legal or regulatory requirement, we would be unable to delete your information. Where you have given consent for us to use your personal data for specific purposes, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us via the Data Protection Representative detailed in the country specific Privacy Statement published on the Knight Frank Website you are visiting or by:
emailing us at

or,
writing to us at Knight Frank LLP, 55 Baker Street, London, W1U 8AN.
