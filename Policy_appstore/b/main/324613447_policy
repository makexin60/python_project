1. Who We Are and Scope Of This Privacy Notice
LastPass is an award-winning password manager and provider of password and identity management
solutions
(“Services”) that are convenient, easy to manage and effortless to use for individuals and businesses. This Global Privacy Notice (hereinafter “Privacy Notice”) is designed to provide customers, end users, and visitors with important information about the types of personal data LastPass US LP and its affiliates (“LastPass,” “we,” “us,” “our”) collect from or about you and our practices for collecting, using, sharing, or processing of that data.  LastPass US LP is based in the United States of America, with affiliates around the world. A complete list of LastPass entities can be found
here
(within the LastPass Affiliate Disclosure).
This Privacy Notice addresses data collected by LastPass where we act as the controller or business, which includes data collected when you visit our webpage(s); visit our offices; register for or participate in our webinars, whitepapers, or contests; communicate with us; and download, access, or otherwise use our Services. This Privacy Notice does not apply in situations where we process personal data on behalf of our customers as a processor or service provider. If our customer provides you with access to our Services, your use is subject to our customer’s privacy and security practices. For more information relating to our customer’s privacy practices or to exercise your rights, please contact the customer directly.
2. What Personal Data Do We Collect
At LastPass, we strive to limit the types and categories of personal data that is collected from and processed on behalf of our users to include only data which is necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected. We do not use personal data for additional purpose(s) which are incompatible with their initial collection. In other words, we have measures and policies in place designed to ensure that we only collect and process data from our users that we believe is necessary to provide them with a world-class Service.
Data We Collect Directly From You
When you visit our website(s), interact with LastPass, or use our Services, you may provide us with the following categories of personal data:
Customer Account Data.
Your email is needed to validate, create, and use LastPass Services. You may also choose to provide identifiers such as first and last name or phone number to help maintain and support your account. Members of a LastPass Families Plan may also provide emails and names of other authorized users.
A Note Regarding Your Mobile Phone Number.
You may provide us with your mobile phone number if you set up two-factor authentication and/or opt-in to our SMS account recovery feature. By opting in to SMS account recovery, you consent to receiving autodialed text messages, including SMS messages, that may be sent by or on behalf of LastPass at the mobile phone number you provide us. Message and data rates may apply.
A Note Regarding Your Master Password.
Except for those LastPass Business accounts which utilize alternative authentication methods (e.g., Single Sign On or “SSO”) to access LastPass, users must create a “Master Password,” which is used to access their LastPass account and generate the encryption keys that secure the data they store within the LastPass Service (“Customer Content” as further defined below).
LastPass is designed to keep your most sensitive data safe using a local-only
,
zero knowledge security model
. This means that no one at LastPass has access to your master password or the data stored in your vault, except you. Vault data is encrypted locally at the device level before syncing to LastPass servers for safe storage – users can only decrypt their vault using their own unique decryption key derived from their master password.
Billing Data.
LastPass utilizes third-party payment processing providers to process payments made through our websites and secure your payment information (such as payment method and billing details). LastPass does not have access to your payment method details or otherwise receive or store any billing data where payment is made for a LastPass subscription through the Google Play or Apple App Store.
Customer Content.
Usernames, passwords, passkeys, secure notes, files, documents, or similar data that we maintain on your behalf, as well as any other information you may choose to upload or input (e.g., manually such as images, audio, or
other information
or via optional functionality such as password save and fill) to your LastPass account in connection with your use of the Services, all of which is referred to as “Customer Content” in our terms of service. This data is encrypted within your vault using our
zero knowledge security model
.
Webinars, Trainings, Contests, and Program Data.
Data you provide to us when you create an account; participate in research projects and surveys; share your attendee information during a conference; or register for any of our events, contests, webinars, whitepapers and surveys. This typically includes, but is not necessarily limited to, identifiers and employer information, such as, first and last name, a valid email address, company name, job title, phone number, and location.
Support and Correspondence.
Data you provide to us when you communicate with us by email, posts to social media pages, chatbots or other automated communication tools, or another method. We process this data to respond to you and in the normal course of our business operations. You may also provide audio or video data when we record sales or support calls.
Feedback.
Where you elect to provide us with feedback, which may include, but is not limited to, reviews or suggestions posted online (e.g., in social channels or review sites,) on app stores, made in connection with surveys, market research, etc., we may use any applicable personal data provided with the feedback to respond to you. We may also use feedback as described in the
Terms of Service
.
Data Automatically Collected When Using Our Websites Or Services
Device and Usage Data (including Session, Location, and Usage data).
When you visit our websites, communicate with us via a chatbot or other automated communication tools, or use our Services, we receive data that you or others voluntarily enter, as well as data that is automatically logged by the website, chatbot, or Service (for example, hardware, equipment, and devices used; authentication details; IP addresses; location; language settings; operating system used; unique device identifiers; and other analytics, diagnostic, troubleshooting, crash, and bug reporting data). We utilize this data to provide, operate, support the use of, and improve our Services. We collect location-based data for the purpose of providing, operating, and supporting the Service and for fraud prevention, export compliance, and security monitoring. (You can disable location data transmission on mobile devices at any time by disabling location services from the settings menu on your device.)
Cookies and Similar Technologies.
Where applicable, if we are permitted to use cookies or similar technologies or contact you for marketing purposes, we may also use your personal data for purposes that are consistent and compatible with the original purpose of collection under the same legal basis or where your consent has been given. Please refer to our
Cookie Notice

We may also contact you and collect analytics or other network activity, such as when you open an email or click a link, where we have a legitimate business purpose to do so (e.g., if you are a current subscriber to one of our Services). We have made it easy for you to  opt-out of receiving further marketing communications from LastPass at any time by visiting
https://info.lastpass.com/unsubscribe
.
Data We Collect From Other Sources
Social Media Integrations.
Many of our websites include optional social media integrations and features, such as Facebook or Google “share” buttons. If you use these features, they may collect your IP address or data about which page you are visiting on our site and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. If you use these services, integrations, and features to authenticate your identity or pre-populate our sign-up or feedback forms, you direct these services to provide certain personal data with us such as your name and email address. You may be able to determine what you authorize those services provide us via your privacy settings of that service.
Third-Party Sources.
In some circumstances, we work with third-party partners and service providers that provide us with data about you. We also collect publicly available data about you from other third-party sources. This data from third-party sources includes identity breach monitoring data (e.g., for dark web monitoring) and other information that may help us detect potential fraud, or information to identify leads and prospects for marketing purposes. This data may contain personal data such as personal identifiers, professional or employment-related information, business contact information, internet activity information, social media profiles, LinkedIn URLs, and custom profiles. We may combine this third-party sourced data with personal data provided by you to draw inferences or make assumptions.

6. Cross Border Data Transfers
As a global organization, LastPass has international affiliates and subsidiaries, utilizes third-party service providers, and maintains a global infrastructure. Data that we collect and maintain will be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries around the world. In cases of a transfer to “third countries,” which may be deemed to not provide the same level of data protection required by the European Commission or your applicable jurisdiction, LastPass applies additional safeguards, in accordance with applicable legal requirements, to ensure that the recipient provides an adequate level of data protection. LastPass utilizes, as applicable and required, lawful data transfer mechanisms, such as the Data Privacy Framework (see “Data Privacy Framework Notice” below), Standard Contractual Clauses (inclusive of any variations recognized in other regions of the world), or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard personal data transfers from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland.
Data Privacy Framework Notice
