2Do does not send your data to a
mother ship
, does not transmit personal information over the wire and does not communicate with anything you do not want it communicating with. Your data belongs to you alone (and other 3rd parties eavesdropping, which does not include us). The sync feature allows you to store information in
your own
Dropbox / iCloud / Toodledo account and will not transmit this information elsewhere. All automatic backups are stored locally on your device, which need to be protected just like any other software / file / email on your device (and thus are as secure as anything else on your device). If you choose not to synchronise data with the above mentioned services, you don’t have to. 2Do works well as a standalone system and will not force you into signing up to a 3rd party. 2Do also works equally well with free iCloud / Dropbox / Toodledo accounts. We do not endorse one service over another (although we do
compare them here
), and you do not have to buy into one of their paid plans if you don’t want to. In short, we respect your privacy and like to stay clear of dodgy business practices.
