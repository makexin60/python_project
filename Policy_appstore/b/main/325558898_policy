We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal health information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in our Apps, which are designed to help you monitor various aspects of your health.

Blood pressure readings
Blood cholesterol levels
Blood glucose levels
Body temperature measurements
Pulse/heart rate readings

This data is stored locally on your device and, if you choose to enable it, in your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to this data, and it is not transmitted to us or any third parties.
2.2 App Usage Data
Our Apps do not collect usage data or analytics about how you use the App.
2.3 Device Permissions
Some of our Apps may request access to your device's camera, microphone, or health database to provide certain functionalities. For example:
Camera access may be used for pulse measurement features
Microphone access may be used for voice note features, if available
Health database access is used for integration with Apple's HealthKit
You can grant or revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings. Denying these permissions may limit some App functionalities but will not prevent you from using the core features of the Apps.
2.4 Advertisements
Some of our Apps may include advertisements. If you interact with these ads, some non-personal information may be shared with the ad service provider (such as Google AdMob). This information is used to serve relevant ads and is not linked to your health data. You can use iOS permissions to opt out of ad tracking.
2.5 Use of Information
The health data you enter into our Apps is used solely within the App to provide you with health tracking and monitoring features. This includes generating charts, reports, and other visualizations of your health data. We do not have access to this data and do not use it for any purpose outside of the App's functionality.

The data you enter into our Apps is used solely to help you track and monitor your health. We do not have access to this data and do not use it for any purpose.
4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

5. Data Storage and Security
5.1 Local Storage
All data is stored locally on your device using Core Data.

7. Children's Privacy
Our Apps do not have any age restrictions and can be used by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
8. HealthKit Integration

We only access HealthKit data with your explicit permission.
We do not use HealthKit data for advertising or data mining purposes.
We do not disclose any information gained through HealthKit to third parties.
