Purpose and legal basis
User Relationship Management
We process your personal data to manage our user relationship with you, including managing your account, providing you with access to our Platform and communicating with you in regard to updates, policies and updated terms and conditions.
As part of this activity, we process personal data, which includes:
Identification and contact information such as name, email address, and postal address, country of origin, username, and preferred language.
Information related to our relationship, including correspondence.
Ratings – A "rating" is a User's ability to evaluate a wine by assigning it a score from 1 to 5 stars.
If you choose to register or sign in via a third-party application (Facebook, Apple and Google), you authorize us to access and collect certain account information, including your name, profile picture, and optionally, your email address and current city.
The processing of your personal data is performed on the legal basis of:
Fulfilling our contractual obligations when delivering the Platform to you cf. Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR on processing necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.
Your personal data is stored for as long as your account is active. Upon deletion of your profile, the identification and contact information will be stored for 6 months after the date of deletion. The ratings will not be deleted as they form part of the overall evaluation of the wines, which is essential for the Services and the Platform. Vivino will retain the User's rating based on Vivino's commitment to providing a credible and factually accurate service.
Disclosure of Wine Reviews for User Interaction
We process
and disclose
your wine reviews and included ratings to enable other Users to follow your reviews. As part of this processing activity, we process personal data, which includes:
Username
Review - A "review" is a User's written evaluation or commentary about a Wine, providing detailed feedback and personal insights.
The disclosure is carried out on the legal basis of:
Your freely given consent, as provided when signing up to the Platform, in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1)(a).
You may withdraw your consent at any time in your profile settings. This will disable the ability for other users to follow you and will anonymize your username, which would otherwise be displayed on your reviews.
Users who request the deletion of their review can ask to have their username removed, ensuring the review remains anonymous. However, the original text of the review will be preserved. If the review is otherwise accurate and the User does not provide compelling individual reasons for deletion, Vivino will retain the user's review based on Vivino's commitment to providing a credible and factually accurate service. Therefore, Vivino generally does not delete reviews, as they do not want reviews to be subject to manipulation or threats from producers – regardless of whether the review is positive or negative. The review may already have been used in other contexts, and we always aim for Vivino to maintain the original text to preserve our credibility as a service and in accordance with the Consumer Ombudsman's Guidelines on the Publication of User Reviews from May 1, 2015.

Sharing of data
Personal data about our users is an essential part of our business. To run the Services and infrastructure we are depending on multiple security-approved data processors for storing and processing personal data.

Your Personal Data is only being passed onto third party processors when it is necessary for us to provide and run a specific part of our service – e.g. when fulfilling orders or sending email newsletters.
We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.

The European Commission has taken an adequacy decision;
standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or the Danish Data Protection Agency are used;
the implementation of additional measures for those third countries where the legislation of the country concerned so requires.
You can obtain further information about our transfer of your personal data to third countries by writing to us.

In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place technical and organizational procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
User accounts including personal data are protected by a password for your privacy and security. You should ensure no unauthorized access to your account and personal data by choosing and protecting your password appropriately, and by signing off when finishing accessing your account. When signing in via a third-party application provider your password is solely managed by such third-party.
We do our best to ensure that User accounts are kept private. However, various instances such as unauthorized entry/use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of the personal data.
This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Platform.
