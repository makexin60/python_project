We also collect information about you that you provide to us when using the Site or making a booking (related to an accommodation, flight, activities, such as  tours or other travel activities, or other available services together "Travel") such as you or guest name, address, phone number, credit card details, e-mail address, Travel Supplier name, Travel location and/or length of stay, any special requirements (see also

In addition for flight reservations, we  may also collect yours and/or your passenger(s) name)s), date of birth, gender, nationality,  passport or national ID details (such as passport or national ID number, country of issue, expiry date, nationality, visa requirements), information about your flight (such as prices, the date of your booking, your itinerary, online or airport check-in, information about additional services purchased, such as extra baggage, upgrades). and information on loyalty or similar programs in place with your flight supplier.
If you decide to book tours or other travel activities through our Site, depending on the type of tour or travel activity, there may be additional information other than what is listed above that we may collect from you, including additional information on your travel itinerary (such as if you or your guests will arrive via air, sea or rail, arrival/departure times, pick up/drop off location), your preferred tour/activity language, height, weight, food preference and other information about any special preferences that our Travel Suppliers need to consider in connection with your participation in the respective tour/activity (including, any child safety information).
If you need to get in touch with our customer support team, or reach out to us through other means (such as through social media, or messaging apps, or communicating with Travel supplier through us), we will collect the information you may choose to provide through such contact.
Where you submit reviews regarding your Travels or other ancillary services available on our website through us, we will collect information from you included in your reviews, including your first name, country of residence and travel photos (if you decide to submit any – please do not submit any personal data in photos, such as faces or other identifiable features).
You can decide to participate in our referral programs or other promotions, and doing this will also mean providing us with personal data. In addition to that, you can provide us with feedback or ask for help with using the Sites or our various communications platforms.
Where you are making a booking with other guests whose details you provide to us as part of your reservation, or if you make a booking on behalf of someone else, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person or people you have provided personal data about are aware that you have done so, and have understood and accepted how Agoda uses their information (as described in this Privacy Policy).

Special categories of personal data
Certain types of personal data, such as religion, gender,  health-related information and data on children, are considered sensitive and may require additional protection under applicable laws. Although we do not ordinarily collect sensitive personal data as part of standard Travel bookings, there may be a need to from time to time, collect such information e.g. as part of travel regulations requirements (e.g. mobility issues), if such information is supportive of a transaction or request that you ask us to perform on your behalf such as a cancellation or amendment of your booking (e.g. health data contained in medical certificates). While we discourage you from providing sensitive data via any of Agoda's channels,  you may choose to share such information voluntarily through any contact you may have with Agoda (e.g. your dietary or any other special Travel preferences). You may also elect to provide us with other information which may imply or suggest information like religion, gender, health or other sensitive information, such as when specifying your dietary preferences. Such collection and processing of such sensitive personal data will be in line with what is set out in this privacy statement.

2. How We Use the Information We Collect
We may use information collected through the Site to:
Provide you with the requested services, such as creating a user account, processing and confirming your reservation, and communicating with you about services requested (e.g., pre-reservation or post booking customer support via various channels, like our Site, email, phone, social messaging apps(e.g. Whatsapp, Line, Kakao, Wechat etc), deal with special request, cancellations, rewards
Send you marketing communications about products, services, news, offers,  promotions or surveys that may be relevant to you. The section about "
Marketing channels and Opting-out of Marketing
" explains more about the marketing channels we may use to communicate with you and how you can opt-out - you always have a right to say no
Conduct surveys or provide you with information about our services on our Site or on other websites you may visit
Maintain and improve the Site, tailor the user experience (including indicating/providing advertisements about products and services of Agoda or third parties that may be relevant to users or that users may be interested in), and for internal training
Protect the security of you and the Site
Exercising a right or obligation conferred or imposed by law, including responding to request and legal demands
When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites or apps, we may also receive certain information such as your name and reservation information, including the Travel reserved, in order to process your reservation and identify which channel your reservation has originated from.
During calls with our customer support team, live listening may be done or calls may be recorded for quality and reference purposes which includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of claims, training and fraud detection purposes. If you would prefer that your call was not recorded, you can opt out by stating this, or by hanging up. Call recordings are kept for a limited amount of time and automatically deleted thereafter, unless Agoda has a legitimate interest to keep such recording for a longer period, including for fraud investigation and legal purposes.
If you have not finalized a reservation online, we may send you up to two reminders to continue with your reservation. We believe that this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the Travel again or fill in all the reservation details from scratch. These reminders are one-time only communications and reservation information used for such reminders will be deleted from our systems in accordance with our data retention policy detailed below.
Please note that the  confirmation emails and text messages sent after your booking are not marketing  messages. These messages are part of your Travel reservation process.  Respectively, they contain information for you to check in at your booked Travel and a separate invitation to complete the review form. You  will continue to receive them, even if you have opted out of our marketing  messages. Similarly, opting into receiving Price Alerts will not affect any  other choices you have made regarding receiving communications from us. If you  elect to receive Price Alerts, you will be able to opt out of receiving the  same by clicking on the “turn off price alerts” or a similar message found in  the Price Alert sent to you.
If you have selected a Mix and Save offer but look to have only  finalized part of the offer (e.g. only finalized the booking for one but not  both rooms), we may send you an email confirming you selected Mix and Save and  to remind you to complete all bookings for your selected Mix and Save offer.  This message is part of the Mix and Save booking process confirming your  selection and in case you have overlooked completing all bookings. In addition  to this, we may also send you a pre-check in email reminding you about changing  rooms during your stay at the accommodation.
As mentioned above, if you are completing the booking for another person who will stay at the reserved accommodation, you also have the option to insert the guest’s email address for the purpose that the guest will receive the reservation confirmation and a separate invitation to complete a guest review subject to this privacy policy.
Customer support on social messaging apps (e.g. Whatsapp, Line, Kakao, WeChat etc)
We may maintain social media accounts (beware of fake accounts !) and we may integrate with available social media services (e.g. social media messaging apps such Whatsapp, Line, Kakao, WeChat etc) for you to communicate with us about your reservations, Travels and our services. Whenever you connect with us through these apps, you may direct your social media provider to send us information about you such as your username, phone number, or other profile information, as controlled by your provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings. Your social media provider will generally inform you about which information will be shared, so please carefully read their privacy and cookie policies ahead.
We discourage you from providing sensitive personal data (including credit card number, see more in Section 1) on any of our customer support channels. If you choose to disclose, Agoda accepts your explicit consent to use that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Your Communications with Travel Suppliers on the Site
We may also offer you and certain Travel Suppliers   various means to communicate about Travels and existing reservations, directing the communications through the Site.
You can contact us or the relevant Travel Supplier with questions about your reservation or about your Travels via the Site, and via other channels that we may make available.
We may access communications on any channels we make available and may use automated systems to review, scan, and analyze communications for security purposes; fraud prevention; compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; investigations of potential misconduct; product development and improvement; research; customer engagement, including to provide you with information and offers that we believe may be of interest to you; and customer or technical support. We reserve the right to block the delivery of or review communications that we, in our sole discretion, believe may contain malicious content, spam, or may pose a risk to you or, Travel Suppliers, us, or others. Note, all communications sent or received using the Site’s communication tools will be received and stored by us. Business partners through whose platform you made the reservation and Travel Suppliers may choose to communicate with you directly via email or other channels that we do not control.
Algorithms and Machine Learning

Terms of Use
, we may deploy tools in providing and seeking to improve and develop our services that utilise algorithms and machine learning (including predictive analytics tools  and tools deploying generative AI algorithms to create new content).

We consider requirements under applicable laws and other relevant matters as part of how we deploy and utilise such tools.
