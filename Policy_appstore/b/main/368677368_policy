C. Core automated processes
Uber uses automated processes to enable certain parts of our services, including functions essential to our business such as matching, pricing and fraud prevention and detection.
Uber relies on automated processes to enable essential parts of our services, including matching (pairing users requesting and providing transportation and/or delivery services), pricing (calculating the amount owed for such services) and fraud detection and prevention. These processes allow Uber to provide a seamless, and safe, experience to millions of users globally every day.
This section describes how automated matching, pricing, and fraud prevention and detection processes work, including how they impact your Uber experience and the personal and non-personal data used to enable these processes.
You may contact Uber
here
if you have questions or concerns regarding these processes.
1. Matching
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms to efficiently match Riders and drivers, or delivery people and Order Recipients. This helps us minimize wait times for you, and enable efficiency for drivers and delivery people.
The matching process is triggered when you request transportation or deliveries through Uber. Our algorithms then evaluate various factors to determine the best match, including your location, requested destination, the proximity and availability of drivers or delivery people, traffic conditions, and historical data (including, in some markets, whether the specific Rider and driver have previously reported having negative experiences with each other).
The trip or delivery request is then communicated to the driver/delivery person matched through this process. Once a trip or order is accepted, we send confirmation of the match to you and the driver/delivery person.
We are constantly refining our matching process to provide the best experience to all users on our platform and may consider different factors depending on the location where you use Uber.
Additional information on Uber’s matching process is available
here
.
2. Pricing
Down Small
When you request transportation or a delivery, Uber uses algorithms to determine the price you pay based on a variety of factors, including:
The type of service you request (for instance, UberX, UberXL, Uber Black)
Your location
Estimated time and distance to destination
Availability and proximity of drivers or delivery people
Time of day
Traffic conditions
Historical data such as traffic patterns and seasonal trends.
Your price may also vary depending on tolls or surcharges incurred, tips, discounts, promotions and subscriptions, and route-based adjustments.
The price may also vary depending on surge pricing, which automatically goes into effect when there are more Riders in a given area than available drivers. This encourages more drivers to serve the busy area over time and shifts Rider demand, to maintain reliability and restore balance.
Additional information on Uber’s pricing process is available
here
.
3. Fraud prevention and detection
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms and machine learning models to prevent and detect fraud against Uber or our users. This includes efforts to monitor for account takeovers, suspicious user behaviors, and unauthorized access attempts, including by third-party aggregators.
These tools look for patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, such as those that vary significantly from typical user behavior. To do this, Uber performs real-time monitoring of information collected from or generated by users, including location data, payment information, and Uber usage. We also examine historical data and compare it against real-time data to help detect suspicious behavior.
Uber may limit your access to its services, or require that you undertake a particular action such as verifying your identity before allowing such access, if it detects potential fraudulent activity.
You may contact Uber customer support
here
if you have questions or concerns about these processes.
