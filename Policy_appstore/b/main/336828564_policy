Device and activity data may be automatically collected via our Sites, as described below.
Device Information.
Depending on the permissions you’ve granted and other factors, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device when you download or use apps created by our Sites, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, certain player search results, and other personalized content. Examples of the device information we may collect include:
Attributes such as the operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.
Device locations, including non-specific geolocation data.
Connection and device information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number and IP address.
Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services, and we encourage you to contact your device manufacturer for detailed instructions on how to do that.
Activity and Cookie Data
. Your Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which store small amounts of data on your computer or device about your visit to our Sites. We and our service providers use browser and flash cookies and other common online tracking technologies, including electronic images known as “web bugs” (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons”). We generally refer to such other tracking technologies (including pixels and tags) and cookies as “cookies.”
Cookies allow us and our service providers to automatically collect information regarding general user-traffic patterns, and your interactions with our Sites, including managed social media presences, and other unaffiliated sites and mobile applications. In using such technology, we thus collect such automatically transmitted data as the page served, time, source of the request, type of browser making the request, preceding page view, dynamic IP addresses and other such information to understand how our advertising campaigns are performing or how to improve and tailor advertising and the Sites experience for you. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you. Please see below for a description of how our Sites may be impacted by cookie settings on your devices.
Payment Information.
If you purchase any products on our Sites, we will collect payment card information from you, including your name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address. This information will be transmitted to appropriate third party payment service providers. We may offer you the option to save certain payment card information on our Sites. If you elect to save such information on our Sites, you will be able to add, delete, or modify that information at any time using your account settings. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial, transactional or other information from such third party payment service providers for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Sites, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, protecting against or identifying possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.
Social Media Platforms and Networks.
If you interact with us on social media or use features, such as plugins, widgets, social media sign-in or other tools made available by social media platforms or networks (such as, but not limited to, Facebook Connect) in connection with our Sites and Other Channels, we may collect information that you share with us on social media or that such platforms share with us. Please review the privacy policies and settings of the social media platforms and networks that you use for more information about their privacy practices.
What are our policies to manage cookies, “Do Not Track” signals and interest-based advertising?
Cookie Policy; Controlling Our Tracking Tools.
You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our Sites, although active participation in certain areas of our Sites may require cookies. You can set your browser to refuse or delete cookies. Please consult the corresponding instructions of the manufacturer for more detailed information on the actual procedure. If you configure your computer or device to block all cookies, you may disrupt certain features of our sites and limit the functionality we can provide when you visit or use our Sites. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this Privacy Policy will stop.
Responding to “Do Not Track.”
Some browsers have a “
Do Not Track
” (DNT) feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals. However, if you are a resident of a Covered State (defined below) that requires honoring certain opt-out preference signals, we will treat such opt-out preference signals as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal information, or of opting out of the processing of personal information for targeted advertising, as applicable.
Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads.
We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads, including ads served on or through our Sites or on other companies’ websites. These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties on our Sites and through third party websites. For example, your postal code may be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our Sites or on third party websites.
You may prevent Google’s collection of data generated by your use of the Sites (including your IP address) by downloading and installing a Browser Plugin available at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
To exercise certain opt-out choices you may have regarding Cookies from certain providers, please visit the consumer opt-out pages at the
Digital Advertising Alliance
and
Network Advertising Initiative
.
Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on some mobile devices. Users may opt out of certain ads on mobile applications or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings.

When accessing a secure site, the first characters of the site address change from “http” to “https.” If your browser or firewall does not allow use of secure sites, you will not be able to make purchases on our Sites.

Rights to Your Information
Right to Know
As a consumer from a Covered State, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale/sharing of your Personal Information. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, and subject to certain limitations that we describe below, we will disclose such information. Depending on your state of residence, you may have the right to request any or all of the following:
The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.
The categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing that Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom we disclose that Personal Information.
The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (see
Right to Data Portability
below).
Right to Delete
As a consumer from a Covered State, you have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception (under the State Privacy Laws) applies. However, we may retain Personal Information that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to perform certain actions set forth under the State Privacy Laws, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.
Right to Data Portability
As a consumer from a Covered State, you have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information we have collected and maintained about you. Note that if you are a California Consumer, the CCPA allows you to request your information from us up to twice during a 12-month period. To the extent feasible, we will provide our response in a readily usable (and usually electronic) format.
Right to Correct
As a consumer from a Covered State, you have the right to request the correction of any Personal Information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes for which we process it.
Right to Opt Out
You have the right to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for the purposes of: (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of Personal Information; and/or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.
As of the latest date of the Privacy Policy:
We do process Personal Information (and share it with third parties) for the purposes of targeted advertising, which may include cross-context behavioral advertising;
We do sell Personal Information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration; and
We do not engage in profiling decisions based on your Personal Information that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.
We do not sell or share the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is less than 16 (but greater than 13) years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. To our knowledge, we do not sell or share the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age.
If you wish to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for any of the above purposes, or to opt back in, please visit the
Your Privacy Choices
web page, sign up for a MY HUGO BOSS EXPERIENCE account, or indicate that you would like to receive information from us again (through a newsletter or other opt-in link). Where required by State Privacy Laws, we will also treat opt-out preference signals (including global privacy control (“GCP”) signals) as valid opt-out requests.
Right to Limit the Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information
Although you have the right to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive Personal Information (“SPI”) if we are using your SPI, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, we do not collect SPI from you and have not done so within the past 12 months.
Right to Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights, including but not limited to, by:
Denying you goods or services.
Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

Process for Verifying a Consumer’s Request
We will verify any consumer’s request to exercise the Right to Know or the Right to Request Deletion using the following process:
Whenever feasible, we will match, or will engage a third-party identification verification service to match, the identifying information provided by you to the Personal Information that we maintain already on our systems. We will generally avoid requesting additional information for the purposes of verification. Only if we are unable to verify your identity or residency from the information already maintained by us will we request additional information from you. The additional Personal Information collected will only be used for the purposes of accurately verifying your identity in order to effectively allow you to exercise your rights under the Covered State Privacy Laws and for the purposes of fraud prevention. Once we have satisfied these purposes, we will delete the additional Personal Information collected from you as soon as practically possible, except as required for compliance with our record-keeping requirements and applicable law.
At a minimum, we will ask you for your name and email address. However, we may require you to provide us with data points that ensure that we can verify your consumer request to a reasonable degree of certainty.
Inability to Verify a Request
If we are unable to verify your identity to a degree of certainty as required by the applicable law through any reasonable method, we will state in a written response to you that we are unable to verify it.
Authorized Agents
You may designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf to make a request under the Covered State Privacy Laws by using the same channels for exercising your rights described above, such as requesting disclosure of any Personal Information sold or collected by Hugo Boss USA; or requesting deletion or correction of such Personal Information. If your authorized agent does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to submit verified requests for disclosure, deletion, or correction, we reserve the right to deny such a request that we have received and will explain to your authorized agent why we have denied such request. If you should use an authorized agent to exercise your various rights under the Covered State Privacy Laws, we may also require that you (i) provide your authorized agent with written permission to exercise your various rights and (ii) verify your own identity with us through the processes laid out in the sections above and (iii) confirm with us directly that you have provided your authorized agent with permission to submit the request.
Responding to Your Request
We will make every effort to respond to your request within 45 days from when you contacted us. If you have a complex request, State Privacy Laws, allow us up to 90 days to respond. We will still contact you within 45 days from when you contacted us to let you know we need more time to respond. We reserve the right, as permitted, to charge you a reasonable fee to cover administrative costs if your requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.
California “Shine the Light”
In addition to the above rights, under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light”), California residents may have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (a) a list of the categories of personal information, as defined under Shine the Light, such as name, email address, and mailing address, and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, or to opt out of having personal information shared with any third party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes, please contact us at 1-800-484-6267, or at:

Your Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Data
You have the right to opt-out of having your personal information sold. Under certain state laws, this is defined as us receiving some form of payment or other value in exchange for providing your personal information to a non-affiliated third party. You also have the right to opt-out of having your personal information shared for targeted, or cross-contextual, marketing purposes. To effectuate either or both of these rights, please review the steps below. 

We only sell personal information, as defined under certain state laws, to network advertisers who use cookies to collect your personal information to then perform targeted marketing on other sites or platforms. You may opt-out of the sale of your personal information by turning off these marketing cookies. To do so, go to the “Marketing Cookies” tab. By default, the cookies are “on” which is noted by the blue dot in the upper right-hand corner of that tab. To turn off these Marketing Cookies, click the blue dot which will slide the dot to the left and turn it Gray. Then click “Confirm My Choices” in the pop-up box. Please note that if you clear your cookies or use another browser, as described further in our Privacy Policy (see the link below), you will need to return and turn off Marketing Cookies again. Currently we do not share or sell information through additional marketing processes offline.
