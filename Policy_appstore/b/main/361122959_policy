2. How we use the personal information we collect
How we use the personal information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. Our primary purpose in collecting your personal information is to help with a smooth and efficient booking process for you. Having your information allows us to provide services to best suit your needs and make your experience quick and easy. It also helps us improve our Services and identify and develop new Services.
Below is more information about the specific purposes for which we use the personal information we collect about you.
To provide the Services and personalize your experience
: We use personal information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process or complete transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in and provide customer support. We combine personal information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you browse across our websites.
For research and development:
We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful to you, and to identify and develop new Services that may be of interest. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services and identification and development of new Services. For example, to improve a certain feature, we automatically analyse recent interactions of users and how often they use the feature to gather the most relevant information. We automatically analyse and aggregate frequently used searches to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested products. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use. We may ask you to participate in surveys relevant to your use of the Services, for example, your experience using our booking platform or your travel experience. We also test and analyse certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.
To communicate with you about the Services
: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including completing and confirming your booking, reminding you of payments, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you notices. We also send you communications as you onboard to a Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases, you cannot opt out of them as they are necessary for the accurate use and communication of the Services. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.
To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services
: We use your information, including contact information and information about how you use the Services, to identify and send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Webjet ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximising what you get out of the Services, including information about latest deals that we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new offers, promotions and contests.
Customer support
: We use your personal information to resolve the issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance and to improve the Services.
For safety and security
: We use personal information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.
To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights
: Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.
With your consent
: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.
You may withdraw this consent at any time.
3. How we share the personal information we collect
To complete your booking or as otherwise required to provide you with the Services you have purchased, we may pass your information on to our suppliers and other providers of those Services. You accept that not all these recipients may have privacy policies or be subject to privacy laws equivalent to Webjet’s and consent to the disclosure of your personal information for that purpose.
We also share personal information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services. These parties include:
Service Providers
: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.
Webjet Partners:
We work with a global network of partners who help us market and promote our products (for example, by providing consulting and sales services), who generate leads for us and help us improve our products and Services. We may share your information with these partners in connection with these services, such as to assist with marketing and promotions, or as part of our agreement with them.
With your consent:
We share information about you with third parties (including Webjet partners and resellers) when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.
Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights
: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Webjet, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.
Sharing with affiliated companies
: We share and transfer personal information with affiliated entities as part of our global operations. We may also share or transfer information in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.
4. How we store and secure personal information we collect
Information storage and security
We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to secure your personal information.
We use reputable data hosting service providers in Australia and Singapore to host the information we collect.
Security of transactions
Our secure booking server uses encryption to ensure the industry standard levels of security. This is shown by the padlock in the closed position at the base of your browser screen. Any information, including credit card details, that you enter and submit on this page will be encrypted and securely transmitted. When your transaction is complete your information is stored in an encrypted state. All information transmitted on the booking page is done using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data, which are a public key, and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message.
How long we keep information
How long we keep personal information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.
Account information:
We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyse personal characteristics about you.
Marketing information
: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period from the date such information was created.
Any other personal data will be retained for the purposes of our business dealings and in meeting our legal requirements.
5. How to access and control your personal information
You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.
Data subject rights: You have the following rights:
To ask for and receive details about the personal information we hold about you;

Request that we stop using your information
: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your personal information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe an account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.
Withdraw consent
: Where you gave us consent to use your personal information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your personal information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.
Opt out of communications
: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your account , or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.
