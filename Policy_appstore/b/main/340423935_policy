Customer segmentation
To give you the best possible customer experience, we need to get a good picture of who you are. To help us to do that, we run a customer segmentation programme, using a third-party service provider who allocates customers to certain categories or segments based on, for example, their age, address, and order data (i.e., what they have purchased). These are just statistics-based assumptions, for example on your probable shopping habits, and your location. Based on the overall information, we assign you to a specific customer segment. The segment you are in is considered by us for the purpose of offering you promotions, products and services that are most likely to interest you. Customer segmentation and data processing are done under a legitimate interest basis to take better informed business decisions, while we will still rely on consent for sending you relevant advertising that is tailored to your individual needs.
Menopause Your Way
If you show interest or interact with us in connection with our initiative called “
Menopause Your Way
” (see

We may use this information to send you informative materials related to this topic as well as suggestions regarding our products that could be of interest for you. You can always opt-out from receiving such communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link included in each email communications, or by
contacting our Customer Care team
. We will keep updated your profile to ensure that your preferences are respected.
Who do you share my personal information with?
Service providers and affiliates
We grant individuals who help QVC provide the Services access to your personal information, as necessary to perform the tasks required. These people may work for third party service providers. These third-party service providers are required to agree to safeguard your personal information appropriately and according to law. QVC may also share your personal information with certain "Affiliates
" in their capacity as the direct and indirect owners of QVC. These owners include QVC Group, Inc., and its direct and indirect owners. QVC may also share your personal information with certain other Affiliates as necessary to perform the tasks required, and these Affiliates include QVC, Inc., HSN, Inc., and the other companies that are directly or indirectly owned by QVC Group, Inc.
Credit reference agencies
We may perform credit and identity checks on you with a credit reference agency, namely Experian Limited (“
Experian
”) to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity and prevent criminal activity. We will perform those checks if you meet relevant criteria (for instance if your order exceeds a certain monetary threshold or if we are conducting fraud checks), including when you request to use Easy Pay as your payment option. To do this, we will supply your personal information to Experian, and it will give us information about you. The information checked will include information on public registers (including the electoral register) and shared credit, financial situation and financial history information and fraud prevention information. More information on Experian and its role also as a credit reference agency, the data it holds, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights is available at:

We also share personal information about you with others for additional purposes, including:
·         As required or permitted by applicable law, for compliance with a legal obligation; establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary.
·         At the request of government authorities conducting an investigation.
·         With our third-party service providers for order fulfilment, shipping, processing payments, customer service, account servicing, customer research, marketing, provision of information technology services, and records maintenance.

Aggregated or de-identified information that cannot be used to identify an individual and anonymised information is not considered personal information that is covered under this Privacy Statement.
Data Transfers outside of the UK
QVC's Affiliates and third-party service providers having access to personal information may be located in other countries, and not all of these countries are recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information. Any transfer of data to an Affiliate or third-party service provider located in such a country is covered by an appropriate transfer mechanism under UK privacy law. You may contact the DPO or legal counsel at the information provided if you would like more information about transfer mechanisms in place.
Where restricted, sensitive personal information types will not be transferred outside of the country. Personal information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, health, sexual orientation, sex life, trade union membership and genetic and biometric data are subject to special protection and considered by UK privacy law to be “sensitive personal information.”
Links to Other Websites
Our Services contain links to websites or applications controlled by third parties, for your convenience and information. Some linked websites or applications are operated by entities not affiliated with QVC, and these linked websites or applications have their own privacy policies or notices. If you visit other websites or applications through links found on QVC's Services, please review the posted privacy policies on those websites or applications. QVC is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any website or application that is not controlled by QVC.
Automated decision-making
We sometimes use algorithms to make decisions on our behalf. This is referred to as automated decision-making. We use automated decision-making for the following purposes:
To assess your suitability for Easy Pay.
Our algorithms assess your suitability for Easy Pay based on information such as your age, financial position and other circumstances which help indicate whether you will be able to pay us back. This means that we may automatically decide that you are not suitable for Easy Pay, in which case we will reject your application.
To detect and prevent fraud.
Our algorithms may indicate a risk on a transaction or account if they identify a potential fraud against QVC. Such risk is reviewed by us, and the decisions taken are based on patterns in our data, such as an account being used in a way that fraudsters work.
You have the right to contest the decisions we make based on data provided by these algorithms. Please see the
Privacy Rights
section for more information in this regard.
How long does QVC keep your personal information?
Personal information is retained based on legal, business, and contract requirements. If you have additional questions regarding retention, please contact

.
Personal information will be deleted, anonymised, or be limited to specific purposes and kept for no longer than is necessary, taking into account the limitation periods for potential claims. If a type of personal information is used for more than one purpose, then the personal information would be restricted, but kept for the longest applicable period.
The criteria used to determine retention periods include potential data leakage risks associated with retention, law requirements for civil and criminal fraud limitation periods, financial and security risk, warranty periods, customer status, and interpretations and case law from the Information Commissioner’s Office, as well as products offered by the QVC group, which determines a certain frequency of purchase by customers. At the end of this period, we will anonymise or aggregate the data collected.
For more information on retention periods associated with cookies and similar technologies, please read our Cookie Policy.
In any case, during the processing, access to your personal information will be limited to those who actually need it to achieve the purposes for which they are processed. For more information about retention periods and/or the criteria used to determine these periods, please contact us at
