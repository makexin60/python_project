THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS SERVICES

These third parties may use cookies, and other automated data collection technologies (such as pixels and

              This information may include: your IP address, device ID, web browser, mobile network information, pages
              viewed, time spent on web pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information, and may be used by
              Phillips and other third parties to:

Custom & Lookalike Audience Campaigns
We may work with third parties to send you advertisements as part of a customized campaign on third-party
              platforms (such as Facebook or Google). As part of these ad campaigns, we or third-party platforms may
              convert information about you, such as your email address, into a unique value that can be matched with
              a user account on these platforms to allow us to learn about your interests and to serve you advertising
              that is customized to your interests. The third-party platforms may offer you choices about whether you see
              these types of customized ads.
On occasions, we may also share with such third parties, aggregated or anonymised data that cannot
              reasonably be used by those third parties to identify you.  This aggregated or anonymised data is used
              by the third party to create for us “lookalike” audiences displaying similar traits to those extracted
              from the aggregated or anonymised data.
TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Phillips is an international business and operates globally through a network of affiliates worldwide. Your Personal Data may be transferred and processed outside of the UK and the European Economic Area ('EEA') in countries that do not provide the same level of data protection. Where we do so, we will put in place an appropriate safeguard (typically approved data protection clauses) to ensure adequate protection of your Personal Data when it is transferred outside of the UK and the EEA.
You can obtain more details of the protection given to your Personal Data when it is transferred outside the EEA by contacting us (see Contact Information) below.
KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL DATA SECURE
We are committed to ensuring that any Personal Data we hold about you is properly safeguarded. We seek to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect your Personal Data against unauthorised access or disclosure and any loss, destruction or damage.
We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your Personal Data from external threats, however, please be aware that there are inherent security risks of sending information by public networks or on public computers and we cannot therefore guarantee the security of any data disclosed or transmitted over the internet.
Please note that our Bids, Client Accounting and Shipping Departments may seek your credit card details and/or bank account information by email in order to take payment for transactions or guarantee payments. Please note that the security, confidentiality and reliability of email cannot always be guaranteed.
Where you sign up to participate in auctions or receive other Services, you may be provided with log-in information and may have the ability to set passwords to allow you to access a personal account page. Where we do so, it is on the condition that you will be responsible for ensuring that such log-in information and any passwords are kept secure and confidential at all times. You will not share any log-in information or passwords, without our express authorisation. We cannot be responsible for any loss or damage caused by your negligence, misuse of log-in details or your decision to share account access with others.
Sometimes unauthorised individuals send e-mails to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information, using the information (such as the email and domain names of) a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such information is sought for identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing."
If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information via e-mail or to a website that seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such requests to us.
WEBSITE LINKS
Our website may be linked to by third parties providing access to our bidding platforms and may contain links to other websites not operated by the Phillips Group (for example third party bidding platforms) ('Third Party Websites'). We do not have any control over such Third Party Websites to which we link, and we cannot be held responsible for the privacy of any Personal Data which you provide after you have used any link on our website to visit these Third Party Websites. You should exercise caution and look for any applicable privacy statements appearing on such Third Party Websites.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
The Phillips Group may retain your Personal Data:
for as long as we are providing you with Services; or
after your account / agreement with us is terminated, or if your application for a particular service or services is declined or abandoned, for as long as we are permitted or required to for legal, regulatory, fraud prevention and/or our legitimate business purposes.
Our legitimate interests include the indefinite maintenance of core transaction data, in the interests of maintaining the integrity of the wider art market.
