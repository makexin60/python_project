Hipstamatic Terms of Use Agreement
This Terms of Use Agreement constitutes a binding agreement between Hipstamatic, LLC ("we", "us", or "our") and each end user ("you" or "your") regarding your use of hipstamatic.com, hipstamart.com, swankolab.com, incredibooth.com, disposable.hipstamatic.com, any other website owned by us (collectively, the "Websites") and/or all applications or products (the "Products") offered by us including Hipstamatic®, Cinamatic®, Oggl®, IncrediBooth®, TinType™, DSPO™, and SwankoLab®.
By using or accessing the Websites or Products, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Websites or Products, as applicable.
We grant you permission to use the Websites and Products, provided that: (a) your use is solely for your personal, noncommercial use; (b) you will not copy or distribute any part of the Websites or Products in any medium without our prior written consent; (c) you will not alter or modify any part of the Websites or Products other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Websites and Products for their intended purpose; and (d) you will otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement. We may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time with or without notice to you. However, no change to this Agreement will apply to a dispute of which we had actual notice on the date of such change. We will notify you of any changes to this Agreement by posting them on the Websites. You agree that you will periodically check the Websites for updates to this Agreement. You agree that you will be deemed to have notice of any modifications once we post them to the Websites and that your continued use of the Websites and Products after such notice shall be deemed an acceptance of any changes. We reserve the right to discontinue the Websites and Products or to change the content of the Websites and Products in any way and at any time, with or without notice to you, without liability.
In order to access some features of the Websites and Products, you will have to create an account. You are not allowed to use another user's account without the other user's permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. If any of your information changes, you agree to update your registration information as soon as possible. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You may change your password at any time by updating your account profile page. In addition, you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. We reserve the right to terminate your access to all or part of the Websites and Products at any time in our sole discretion and without prior notice.
You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or similar technological devices or programs that access the Websites or Products in a manner that sends more request messages to the Websites' or Products' servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we grant the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Websites for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. We reserve the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases, in our sole discretion.
Our Websites and Products may allow you to chat or participate in blogs, message boards, online forums, contests and other functionality and may provide you with the opportunity to provide us with ideas, suggestions, opinions, comments, observations, text, data, photos, graphics, video, music, sound, chat, messages, files or other material (collectively "User Submissions"). You agree that any material you provide to us, other than Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us upon creating a user account with us or that we otherwise agree is confidential in writing, will be treated as non-confidential and nonproprietary. You agree not to collect or use User Submissions or any Personally Identifiable Information, including account names or email addresses, of other end users from the Websites or Products, nor use the communication systems provided by the Websites or Products for any commercial solicitation purposes.
You grant to us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User Submissions in connection with our Websites and Products.  You represent and warrant that you have the right to grant the license of your User Submissions granted in this Agreement. You are still the owner of your User Submissions and are still free to use them in any manner you choose.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, when you use certain permitted features of our Websites and Products that allow us to share your User Submissions only with other users that you have selected, the foregoing license is only granted to us to the extent that we may provide those users whom you have granted rights to view your User Submissions access to view such User Submissions and we may not otherwise use such User Submissions without first obtaining your permission. Because certain features offered through our Websites and Products, including but not limited to the "Post" feature, may allow us to share your User Submissions with other users you have selected while also making those submissions available to users that you have not selected, please review all features that allow User Submissions prior to making submissions.
We have no obligation to monitor or enforce any intellectual property rights that may be associated with your User Submissions, however, you grant us the right to enforce such rights through any means we see fit, including bringing and controlling actions on your behalf. Unless we explicitly state in writing, we do not endorse any User Submissions, and we make no representations or warranties regarding User Submissions. You acknowledge that you will evaluate and bear any risks related to your use of any User Submissions. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. As such, your sole recourse for any damage you may suffer as a result of User Submissions shall be to pursue the originator of such User Submissions.
We have no obligation to accept, display, review, monitor, or maintain any User Submissions. We reserve the right to delete User Submissions from the Websites and Products without notice for any reason at any time. You acknowledge that you do not rely on us to monitor or edit the Websites and Products and that the Websites and Products may contain content which you find offensive and you hereby waive any objections you might have with respect to viewing such content.
