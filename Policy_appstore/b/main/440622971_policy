Target Privacy Policy
Target is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we collect, use and disclose information about our customers, team members, suppliers (and their employees) and people who apply for employment with us. It also explains how to contact us if you have any questions about the management of your personal information or would like to access the personal information we hold about you. This Policy describes how we comply with our obligations under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
"We", "us", "our" and "Target" means Target Australia Pty Ltd ABN 75 004 250 944 (trading as Target) and its Australian and offshore subsidiaries Target Australia Sourcing Limited (including the Shanghai Representative Office), Target Australian Sourcing Limited Bangladesh liaison Office, and Target Australia Sourcing (Shanghai) Co Ltd (including the Dongguan Branch).
Our approach to handling data
At Target, we collect and use data for a range of reasons. In handling data, including personal information, we will comply with all relevant laws, but we also want to ensure that we meet the following expectations:
Improve the customer experience
We will use customer data responsibly to improve the customer experience and deliver more relevant products, services and offers
Be transparent
We will clearly explain how we collect and use customer data
Make it simple and easy
We will minimise disruption to the customer shopping experience by making it simple and easy to provide consent
Provide control to the customer
We will respect the customers privacy by providing control over how customers can be contacted
When we are delivering on these expectations with some of our closest partners, the privacy policies and practices of those partners may apply in addition to this Privacy Policy. To provide you with greater clarity, we’ve highlighted some of our most significant relationships involving your personal information (sections 6-8). These include:
Flybuys, a loyalty program which we participate in to provide you benefits;
OnePass, a membership program which we participate in, along with other brands (“Participating Brands”), to provide you with tailored engagement and member benefits. Throughout this Policy, a reference to ‘Related Companies’ includes OnePass as it is also a related company of ours;
Related Companies, these are companies within the Wesfarmers Group (including Wesfarmers, Kmart, Officeworks, Bunnings, Priceline, InstantScripts, OnePass and Catch).
