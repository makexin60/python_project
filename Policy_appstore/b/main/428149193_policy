Information We Collect
Go Books:
When you buy books directly through gobooks.com, or register the books you’ve purchased using in-app purchase using Register Your Purchases in the Go Books app, or Go Books Account in SmartGo One, we use your email to identify which books you’ve purchased, so that we can provide you access to those books on different platforms.
We store a list of devices you’ve registered for use with the Go Books and SmartGo One apps: just the kind of device (Mac/iPad/iPhone) and your system software version. You can always
check the list of books and devices
associated with your email.
SmartGo for Mac/Windows:
We use your email to activate your free trial, and to verify that you’re the person who purchased SmartGo.
Payments:
We use Stripe to handle payments; we never see your credit card. We store your email, your ZIP code (to determine sales tax), date and time of payment, and a reference to the Stripe transaction. (See
Stripe’s privacy policy
.)
Subscriptions:
SmartGo One subscriptions can be managed under Subscriptions in the Settings app. Apple provides detailed information on
how to manage
and
how to cancel
subscriptions.
SmartGo Blog
Our blog (
smartgo.blog
) is hosted by WordPress.com (Automattic) and is using cookies and analytics as described in
