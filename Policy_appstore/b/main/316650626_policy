ReachMD.com Privacy Policy
The ReachMD.com website (“Site”), as well as the ReachMD mobile applications (“Apps”), are owned and operated by U.S. HealthConnect, Inc. doing business as ReachMD (”ReachMD” or “us” or “we” or “our”). This privacy policy (“Policy”) governs the manner in which we collect, use, maintain and disclose information collected from users (“User” or “you”) of the Site, Apps and any other website or mobile app where this Policy is posted or published, or if you interact with us through social media, by phone, in writing, in person or through any other interactions you may have with ReachMD (all of which will be referred to collectively, together with the Site and Apps, as the “Services”). This Policy also explains how you can exercise certain rights you may have in connection with your privacy and the information we collect from you.
This Policy only applies to the Services identified above, and does not apply to information which you may send us by other means. Other sites, apps and other online locations, including any social media platforms or services you may use to interact with ReachMD,  may have their own privacy policies or notices which apply instead of this Policy, and you should consult those accordingly.
The Services are intended for users sixteen (16) years of age or older. If you are not 16 years of age or older, you are
NOT
permitted to access or use the Services.  If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.
This Policy is effective as of April 15, 2024
Changes to this Policy
We retain sole discretion to update this Policy from time to time. When we update this Policy, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site and Apps and update the Policy’s effective date. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically and become aware of modifications. Your continued use of the Services after any changes are made to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If any of the changes are unacceptable to you, you should cease using the Services.
If any changes to this Policy substantially affect how ReachMD treats or handles personal data that has already been collected by ReachMD, we will notify you by email (if ReachMD has a valid email address to use) and give you thirty (30) days to opt-in to the changes as they pertain to your information. If you do not opt-in, your information will continue to be used in a manner that is consistent with the version of this Policy under which it was collected.
Collection of Personal Data
Personal data (“Personal Data”) is generally defined as information that, by itself or in combination with other information, may be able to identify you or could reasonably be associated with you, your household or your accounts.
We may collect Personal Data from Users who voluntarily provide such information in a variety of ways on or through the Services. For example, Users may provide, be asked for, or allow us to collect Personal Data including:
Contact Information
such as your name, practice name, phone number, email address or mailing address; social media (linking)
Communications Information
such as any recorded communications you have with us through email, our online customer service chat bot or over the phone for quality assurance purposes;
Professional Information
like your practice name, office address, other business information or national provider identifier (NPI) number, area of expertise, and the professional education courses and other resources you use, attend or participate in through the Services; educational interests, state license number, medical school and year of graduation, and to the extent that you apply for an open position on our Site your resume and professional work experience;
Log-in Information
like your username and password when you log onto your account on our Site;
Device and Activity Information
which may include your IP address and your activity when visiting our Site including the different webpages, articles, or videos you viewed or links you clicked (please see the “Device Information and Cookies” section below for further information);
Purchase and Attendance Information
such as which education or training courses or events you purchased and/or completed through our Site or your use of the Services; and/or
Payment Information
including your credit/debit card number or other financial information.
Additionally, ReachMD may collect inferences about ReachMD content we think may be of interest to you based on your apparent preferences from the categories of professional information we collect about you.
Personal Data Sources
The voluntarily provided Personal Data summarized above is collected from you whenever you:
visit or use our Services;
register an account on or through the Services;
register for an event;
subscribe to a newsletter;
respond to a survey;
fill out a form;
order training services or materials;
create a username and password (or security question and answer); and/or
seek information in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on or through the Services.
ReachMD may collect some of your contact information and professional information from pharmaceutical companies that provide us with physician level data (PLD), which we then use to track the content you listen to and/or view on or through the Services. The pharmaceutical companies that provide us with your PLD may receive professional information about any ReachMD courses you attend or other Services you use as a result of this process. This exchange of PLD and other professional information may result in you receiving advertising content that is based on the ReachMD content you listen to and/or view, and other Services you use.
ReachMD generally will not ask you to provide any sensitive data, such as your religious beliefs, citizenship status, sexual orientation, or your race or ethnicity, but you may be able to voluntarily provide such sensitive data in any content that you may upload or post on or through the Services. To the extent you include any sensitive data in content you voluntarily make available through the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree that such data may be processed by ReachMD as necessary to provide the Services in accordance with your instructions.
We may also collect your IP address, Device ID, and other information in an automated manner through the use of cookies as described, below. We will collect any other Personal Data from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.
We will not collect additional categories of Personal Data or use the Personal Data we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice and obtaining your consent to the new processing activities. If you do not opt-in, your information will continue to be used in a manner that is consistent with the version of this Policy under which it was collected, or the information will be deleted.
Users can always refuse to supply Personal Data, except that doing so may prevent Users from engaging in certain activities or content related to the Services.
Online Tracking Technologies
Device information, cookies, and other online tracking tools
There are other areas of the Services where Personal Data or other information may be collected from you in an automated manner. When you visit or use certain Services, for example, we may automatically collect certain
Device Information
about your computer, browser or device that includes information about your web browser, such as your IP address, time zone, and some of the cookie identifiers that are installed on your device. ReachMD will treat such device information as Personal Data to the extent such device information is reasonably capable of identifying a particular individual.
The Services may use “cookies” to enhance the User's experience. For example, cookies are placed on your hard drive when you visit the Site for record-keeping purposes to better understand how Users interact with the Services, optimize response times, remember what language you prefer, and sometimes to track authentication information to prevent unauthorized access to Users’ accounts. A User may choose to set their web browser or mobile device to refuse or disable cookies. If cookies are blocked by Users, some parts of our Services may not function properly.
Google Analytics
ReachMD may also use third-party service providers which collect and aggregate information to analyze how Users move around the Services, in order to optimize the performance of the Services. For example, the Services may use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics service that uses online tracking tools to analyze how you use aspects of the Services. The information collected by these cookies about your use of the Services (including page views, scrolls, videos or links that were clicked, a unique client ID attributable to your device and browser information, your approximate age, gender, interests, language settings on your device or browser,  and approximate location metadata derived from your IP address (city, state, and country)) is transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information to assess your use of the Services, providing reports on data such as how often you visit, what pages you view when you visit, and what other websites you visited prior to visiting or using our Services, for example. Google may transfer this information to third parties, if required by law or if third parties process the information on behalf of Google.

. For more information on Google’s privacy practices generally, please review Google’s privacy policy at
https://policies.google.com/privacy
. To opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics, you may be able to download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
. These Google services may also cause you to receive personalized ads based on your browsing behavior. You may be able to opt-out of receiving these personalized ads by using the settings at
https://adssettings.google.com/
Other third-party online tools
Our Services include other third-party online tools that are used to connect our Site to our pages on social media platforms as well as for data analytics and targeted advertising purposes. By using these third-party online tools, information about your use of the applicable platform, your device, and your activity on the Site (including which webpages and videos you may have viewed) may be shared with such third parties.  You may be able to opt out of being tracked through these online tools by following the directions noted in the table below.

We may also disclose User information if required or requested by law enforcement or a governmental body, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data
Your provision of Personal Data and other information to ReachMD means you agree that we may collect, use and disclose your information according to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not  provide any Personal Data. However, certain Services can only be offered if you provide your Personal Data to ReachMD.
In connection with ReachMD’s collection and use of your Personal Data, and depending on where you reside, you may have a right to:
Confirm whether ReachMD  has collected and is processing your Personal Data and, if so, you may have a right to request access to or correction of your Personal Data;
Obtain a copy of Personal Data that ReachMD maintains about you in a portable and readily usable format, if technically feasible, that would allow you to transfer such Personal Data to another service or provider, where the applicable processing is carried out by automated means;
Opt-out of any processing of your Personal Data for the purposes of, as applicable and subject to contractual and legal restrictions, (1) targeted advertising based on your browsing behavior before and after you visit or use the Services, (2) any sale of your Personal Data, or (3) any profiling of you or automated decision-making processes based on collected Personal Data in a way that would produce legal ramifications or similarly significant real-world effects on you, or (4) with respect to sensitive Personal Data (if applicable), inferring characteristics about you, subject to certain conditions;;
Request details on the specific pieces of Personal Data that ReachMD has collected about you;
Request that ReachMD delete or properly dispose of copies of Personal Data it has collected about you, subject to contractual and legal restrictions; and not be discriminated against, in terms of the quality and prices offered in connection with our Services, because you exercised these rights regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data; and.
Submit an appeal to a regulatory authority if we reject your request to exercise any of these rights (if applicable).
How to Exercise Your Rights
If you would like to request the ability to access, review, edit, delete or have us otherwise dispose of any copies of the Personal Data ReachMD collected from you, if you would like to opt-out of receiving further information, if you want to limit what Personal Data ReachMD shares, if you otherwise wish ReachMD to stop using your Personal Data in the manners specified in this Policy, or if you would like to exercise the above rights in any other way (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), please contact us at
info@reachmd.com
or by calling us at 1-866-390-9909 (Toll-Free).
You may grant an authorized agent written permission to submit requests regarding your Personal Information, but we may deny authorized agent requests absent proof that you authorized such agent to act on your behalf, or if we are unable to verify your identity.
Verifying Your Identity
ReachMD is required to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Data. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have a password-protected account, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity. For most other requests, ReachMD will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Data we store about you before responding to your request. If you would like to request the specific pieces of your Personal Data that ReachMD has collected, or if you would like us to delete highly sensitive information, you will need to match at least three pieces of information we store about you, and you must provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Data you are requesting. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Under such circumstances, ReachMD may follow up with you for additional information as reasonably necessary to authenticate your request. Subject to applicable legal requirements, if ReachMD refuses to act on a request you make based on the rights listed at the beginning of this section, you may have a right to submit an appeal by contacting us using the same method as when you made the initial request. In the event ReachMD must deny your appeal, we will provide a way for you to forward your complaint to the appropriate legal authorities.
Data Deletion Considerations
Any removal of information or content by ReachMD does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal in all places. The content or information may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information. ReachMD  will do its best to accommodate your request to delete Personal Data we collected from you, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Data from the specified uses. If the request relates to information that ReachMD needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Services properly moving forward.
ReachMD reserves the right to maintain proper records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Data.
How to Exercise Your Opt Out Rights / Do Not Track
As previously described above, when you visit and interact with the Services, certain third parties may get access to certain information about you as referenced above, such as your device information, professional information and PLD, for the purpose of providing you online advertising personalized to your interests based on your browsing behavior. To the extent any of this sharing or third-party access may be considered a “sale” of your Personal Data under applicable privacy laws and regulations or if you otherwise have the right to opt-out of sharing for targeted advertising purposes, you may exercise choices regarding such sharing or third-party access by clicking
here
, or by using the email address or toll-free phone number provided in the previous paragraph.
Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature or similar privacy controls or settings that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. The Services are not currently configured to recognize or respond to “Do Not Track” signals or similar technical requests sent by a User’s browser or other device settings.  To learn more about other ways to possibly opt-out of certain kinds of tracking that could result in you receiving targeted advertising based on your behavior online, visit the
Network Advertising Initiative website
and the
Digital Advertising Alliance website
. You can also change your browser cookie settings to block/delete the cookies by going to the browser settings page (
see
Chrome
,
Safari
,
Firefox
, &
Internet Explorer
).
Options you select through these third-party services are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee that these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising. As noted previously in this Policy, it is possible that third parties may collect or receive information through the Services. Since it is possible that some of these third parties may respond differently than ReachMD to “do not track” requests, you should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information.
If you would like to opt-out of receiving further promotional emails from ReachMD, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send ReachMD a detailed message at
info@reachmd.com
.
Data of Minors
ReachMD does not knowingly collect any information from minors, nor are the Services directed at or intended for minors. If a minor uploads/posts information on or through the Services that is publicly available, the minor has a right to request that such information be removed from public viewing. A minor may request uploads/posts or other information to be removed by sending a detailed message at
info@reachmd.com
. Any removal of content by ReachMD does not ensure or guarantee complete removal of the content in all places. The content may have been reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information.
How We Protect Your Information
As to Personal Data we collect, ReachMD’s Services use, implement and maintain industry standard security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Data and other data stored on or through our Services, both in storage and in transmission.
However, while ReachMD takes the protection of your Personal Data seriously, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit online, including on or through any of our online Services. No data transmission over the internet can be assured to be completely secure, as any transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches ReachMD. As a result, ReachMD does not ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If you are concerned about sending information to ReachMD over the internet, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements. ReachMD is not responsible for the security of information sent over the internet.
How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
ReachMD retains collected information for a reasonable amount of time in order to fulfill the stated purpose for why the information was collected or for other legitimate purposes such as ensuring security of our data and systems, complying with our legal obligations, complying with tax, audit, or other books and record policies, resolving disputes, conducting internal investigations, and enforcing our agreements or other legal rights. Due to the different purposes for retaining your Personal Data, the actual retention timeframes may vary depending on the type of Personal Data we collect from you and the purposes for which we use your Personal Data. ReachMD reserves the right to maintain proper business records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Data. If ReachMD determines that collected information is no longer needed, it will delete such information or anonymize the information so that it can no longer be attributed to you. Our collection times will be consistent with applicable law.
Please note that residual copies of your Personal Data may be removed from backup systems subject to our backup data retention schedule.
How We Handle E.U. Data
If you are a User residing within the European Economic Area (the “EEA,” which includes the 27 European Union Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (collectively, the “EU”), then ReachMD handles your Personal Data according to the terms of this Policy, unless the exceptions in this section apply, pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
