.
STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will keep your data only for as long as it is necessary for the specific purpose or purposes for which we
have collected or used them in accordance with this privacy policy.
Account deletion
If you want to
permanently delete your account
or following your explicit request for deletion of any of your personal information, we will delete your account and/or help you to delete your personal information as requested. Due to the nature of the game and the way that users interact, you will need to take all steps necessary to facilitate the deletion, including adopting or removing any geocaches you own,
deleting your logs
, and disabling your account. We will then complete the deletion process as soon as possible. The way our systems are structured, in some cases, it may take up to 30 days for records to be deleted or overwritten. In some circumstances (set out below) we may keep your personal information for longer.
Because of the nature of our services, which require a cellular data plan or GPS device and the ability to travel to various locations, our services are not directed toward anyone under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 16 has an account not created and managed by you, then you may alert us via
email
or otherwise
contact us
and request that we delete that child’s personal information.
When you stop playing
If you stop playing or temporarily disable your account, without taking any further steps or asking us to
permanently delete your account or personal information, we will keep your information as long as needed to
ensure the integrity of the game and the enjoyment of other players. Your geocache and trackable logs and any
images associated with them will remain as part of the historic record of the geocache or trackable with which
they are associated unless you delete them. If you have provided personal information or content that other
users need to use in relation to the services (for example, information about a particular geocache you have
logged or placed; if you have moved or logged a particular trackable; or if you have left instructions or goals
about a particular trackable), we may retain that information for as long as we need to provide the services to
our other users, but you may always delete that information if you wish. We know that sometimes users take a
break from the game and come back at a later time, which is why we don’t automatically permanently delete your
account and personal information if you stop playing or temporarily disable your account. We may contact you if
you have stopped playing or temporarily disabled your account to check if you would like us to permanently
delete your information. However, after three years of inactivity, we may delete your account without contacting
you.
Please note that once your account and personal information has been deleted, we cannot get it back. If you
don’t ask us to permanently delete your account and personal information, except as provided above, we will keep
it until you want to reactivate your account, and we will store it securely and in accordance with this privacy
policy.
Information provided for a specific purpose
If you have provided us with personal information for a specific purpose, we will keep your personal
information for as long as we need to fulfill that purpose. Specifically:
If you have provided address information as part of a competition entry, we will keep that information for
          as long as necessary to administer the competition, typically about a year.
We will retain your contact details if you have an account with us or if we think you may be interested in
          marketing messages, offers, promotions, or new services. You will always have the choice of opting out of
          receiving these messages. If you do so, we will remove you from our email marketing lists as soon as we can
          but typically within 10 business days.
If you have posted content online in the discussion forums, unless you request deletion, we will retain that
          content for as long as we think the topic is relevant. After this time, we may delete the post or archive it.
Where we have obtained personal information automatically about your use of our services (e.g., analytics), we
will keep this information for as long as we feel it may be useful to us to improve and develop our business. We
will delete it when it is no longer useful. This will normally be within 24 months of completion of the purpose
for which it was originally collected.
In some cases, we may be required to store personal information beyond the period of time that we need it for
the purposes for which we have collected it, taking into account factors including:
legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain personal information for a certain period of time (e.g.,           compliance with tax and accounting requirements).
the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (e.g., for the purposes of a potential dispute).
If a law requires us to hold onto your personal information, we will store your data for the amount of time
required by that law. Further, we will store your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interest,
such as the requirement to create proper documentation of our business operations.
PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We have implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information, you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We and our payment card processors work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of transport layer security (TLS), which encrypts the information you input.
HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKERS
We also collect data about your use of our services through a variety of tracking technologies, such as cookies, pixels, and software development kits (SDKs). We use these trackers on our websites, in our email communications, and – to a more limited extent – on our mobile applications.
A cookie is a small text file that is downloaded and stored onto your computer, mobile phone, or similar device when you use our websites that enables us to: (a) recognize your computer; (b) store your preferences and settings; (c) understand the web pages of our services you have visited and the referral sites that have led you to our services; (d) enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your inferred interests; (e) perform searches and analytics; and (f) assist with security administrative functions. You can find more detailed information in the Cookies section of your account Settings on the website and at
https://www.geocaching.com/account/documents/cookies
.
Pixel trackers (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email, that are designed to provide usage information, like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of our services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies.
SDKs are pieces of software code provided by our digital vendors (e.g., analytics providers) that are embedded into our mobile apps and are intended to collect and analyze certain device and user data, such as analytics, crash data, and digital identify information to provide services like login via Facebook.
Information we collect using trackers
We collect the following information from you:
The date and time you use our services
Information about your browser, system, or device configuration

You may also use the tools in your browser to disable cookies and pixels; however, disabling certain cookiesmay limit functionality of our services.
On some user profile pages and cache pages, account holders have used links to third-party sites to display content. In some cases, these third-party links may have associated cookies and pixels. Due to the volume of such content, we may be unable to identify all of these cookies and pixles or provide the ability for you to disable them. Please consider browser-based blocking if you wish to block these types of trackers.
Types of trackers that we use
Strictly necessary trackers
Strictly necessary trackers help make our websites usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the websites. The websites cannot function properly without these trackers.
Preference trackers
Preference trackers enable our websites to remember information that changes the way the websites behave or look, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.
Statistics (also called analytics) trackers
Statistics trackers help us to understand how visitors interact with our services by collecting and reporting information about interactions with our services.
Advertising trackers
Advertising trackers are used by third parties to track visitors across websites. The purpose is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and therefor more valuable for publishers and third-party advertisers.

Please note that even if you withdraw your consent, some trackers might not be blocked. Content that other account holders place on our websites (e.g., on their cache pages) in some cases includes links that trigger advertising trackers from third-party sites. Because of the volume of this content, we are not able to identify all of these trackers. Please consider browser-based blocking instead.
