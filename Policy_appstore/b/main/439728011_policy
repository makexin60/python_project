Read more about when we use your personal data
Are you always required to give your consent?
Usually you are not required to do so. We use your data because we are required to do so by law and/or because this is necessary for the performance of the contract you have with us. It is also possible that we have - or a third party has - a legitimate interest. Sometimes it is necessary to ask for your consent, such as in the case of the use of facial recognition for identity verification, for example.

What do we use your personal data for?

Who do we share your personal data with?
There are situations in which we need to provide your personal data to other parties. These are people or organisations that have an involvement of some kind in our services, such as supervisory authorities or the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration.

Profiling is understood to mean the automated processing of personal data, in which we may analyse data on the basis of specific characteristics, such as personal preferences. We do this in order to combat fraud and detect unusual transactions, for example, and with a view to the bank's risk management, product development and client acceptance.
