Privacy Policy
Information we collect: Users of most Drumlin Security Ltd software and websites are not required to register or provide any personal details in order to use the services we provide. Pro editions of Javelin and Javelin3 for Windows, and users of the Drumlin and DrumlinPublisher secure PDF creation software are required to register in order to identify themselves and their ownership of documents they wish to make secure. For users who do register for our software products only basic information provided by the user or publisher is stored and no financial or other personal data is held by us. We do not share your information with any other party. Registered users of our secure publishing software (notably DrumlinPublisher for offline services and the Publisher registration options of our online services) and those making email enquiries for service provision are added to our newsletter list and may receive information from us with the option to opt out of these additional information services if they wish. When secured documents are authorized the following information is recorded: the code used, documentID, date/time, summary device details, software version and IPaddress. This information is stored in the DRM Server Activity Log and retained for three years, and is available to our team and the publisher of the documentID in question, but not to any other parties.
Users of all versions of our offline software requiring access to secured documents will need to enter an authorization code when prompted in order to obtain permisssion to view the file in question (or be provided with a user-specific license file for the document in question - Javelin Pro editions only). For code-based authorizations, details of the authorization code used, date and time, IP address, software version used and basic device-related information are sent to our server and stored as part of this process in order to verify and track usage. This information is available to our team and to the document publisher in order to provide support to end users and the publisher. This data is not made available to any other parties.
Users of Drumlin and DrumlinPublisher will be registered users of these products and in most instances will be subscribers to our Digital Rights Management (DRM) services. As with Javelin Pro editions, basic registration data is retained as an essential element of service provision, but is not used for other purposes or passed onto third parties. Where formal approval for inclusion of customer testimonials and/or logos/graphics has been given this information may be made available for public viewing on our websites and in our press releases and other marketing materials.
Users of our online web-based PDF security services may be registered in some instances, and where registered any personal details such as name and email address, are retained purely for the purposes of service provision to that user and only made available to the publisher whose 
					files they are accessing. Publishers may also register users of their own services and remain responsible for the retention and proper use of such information in accordance with the Privacy policies outlined above and in accordance with national and international guidance and laws on the use of such information.
Users of any of the above products and services may request removal of any personal details held on our servers at any time, although as noted, in most instances no personal data is held. Removal of such data may result in some services and/or software no longer being available to that user.

Company Services and Policies
We assist training organizations, educational publishers and others in the selection and implementation of PDF, Print-on-demand and ePUB-based publishing solutions. The Drumlin Publisher and Javelin reader products and associated services provide secure offline PDF document distribution for individuals, corporates, training organizations and publishing enterprises. We also provide Online (web-based) secure PDF distribution services on an Automated or Managed Service basis, with files hosted on our webdoxx.com, webdoxx2.com and pdf2html5.com domains. Dedicated server solutions and bespoke readers are available as options.
Our standard end user software products are provided free of charge. Where users wish to take advantage of services, such as software development, usage of the digital rights management (DRM) services, document conversion, E-commerce solutions, consultancy etc., separate charges are made. We invest heavily into the continuing provision of the service and the ongoing development and support of the product set and services. We believe that secure publishing should be simple, cost-effective and in the best interests of both publishers and end customers. By its very nature electronic publishing with digital rights management (DRM) attracts a range of views on its value and justification, and it must always be seen as primarily a form of copyright protection - a deterrent to copyright abuse. We are very grateful to publishers and end users for their assistance with our project, particularly in suggesting new functionality, identifying faults, and helping us with multi-language translations

It is a vital contribution to our efforts to produce the best possible solutions with little or no charge where possible. If you have any issues to raise with us please

at the earliest opportunity.

The issuing of such codes and license files is subject to (i) payment in advance for the codes or licenses ordered; (ii) issuing of one code or licenses per document per customer (individual) unless otherwise agreed by Drumlin Security Ltd in writing or for purely test purposes; (iii) unless otherwise agreed in writing, multi-usage codes are provided on the basis that a specific customer may be permitted to install the document on more than one device owned by that customer or for re-installation of a document in the circumstances that their device is lost or stolen, or the operating system and files have had to be reinstalled; (iv) the use of code resets and code re-assignments remains at the discretion of Drumlin Security Ltd. Code resets by publishers are subject to a quota set by Drumlin Security Ltd; (v) unused code quotas may be carried forward from year to year, subject to the subscription service being retained at the previous year's level.
