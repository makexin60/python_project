Atmosphérique Pro – Privacy Policy
1.  Atmosphérique requests your location via the iOS system libraries.  Your location is used to determine the nearest weather station for the "Follow Me" location, and when using the "near me" feature when adding locations. It is also used in the background in order to send push notifications of weather alerts for the appropriate weather station. Users must provide permission for this usage.
If authorization is not provided the application will still work, but you will have to manually select appropriate locations when adding new stations, and you will receive alerts for all locations for which notifications have been enabled.
2.  We do not store your location, nor any other personal data.
