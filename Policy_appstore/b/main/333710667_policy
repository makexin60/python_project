Image from your camera
Smart Eraser
The App offers the Smart Eraser feature to remove unwanted objects.
By default, this feature is turned off. The AI model operates directly on your device, ensuring that no data is collected or transmitted externally. It accesses and processes only the image or document’s page you explicitly choose. Once the erasure process is completed, the model stops running. It can be used again through the menu whenever needed.
The feature does not intentionally restrict the size, format, or content of the images it processes. However, there are unspecified technical limitations on the maximum allowable image size, which depend on the characteristics of a particular device and cannot always be predicted.
The output is always saved as a copy of the original file. Also, the output file format will be preserved only for jpeg, png, or heiс files. All other formats will be converted and saved as jpeg.
Occasionally, the AI model may make errors. The model is sensitive to how an object for erasing has been masked, and it tends to produce both good and bad results depending on the input.
We do not use the user’s data for learning purposes and do not retain or back up any images when the feature is on.
