Doodle Buddy Labs
At Doodle Buddy Labs our mission is to make digital art fun. In pursuit of our mission, we collect and use
          some information from our users. Being transparent about our use of user information and respecting their
          privacy is incredibly important to Doodle Buddy Labs, LLC (“we,” “us” or “our”).
This Privacy
          Policy applies when you use our software products, content, and websites (e.g., www.doodlebuddy.co)
          (collectively, “Services”). It describes the ways we use your information and your rights and choices
          concerning your information. For purposes of data protection laws, we are the “data controller” of your
          personal information. If you do not want us to collect, store, use, or share your information in the ways
          described in this Privacy Policy, you may choose not to use the Services.
Doodle Buddy Labs, LLC complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the Swiss-U.S.
          Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Doodle Buddy Labs,
          LLC has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
When you request information from us through our
          website, you may provide personal data about yourself that may include your name, email address, phone number,
          and other information that can directly identify you individually (collectively, “Personal Information”). We
          also collect Personal Information if you provide it to us as part of our customer support services.
For
          our Doodle Buddy mobile applications, we don’t collect Personal Information because there is no registration
          process, and we don’t otherwise collect any other Personal Information from the
          application.  However, Google and Appodeal, which provide some advertising and analytics services to
          us, may collect Apple’s unique device identifier (called “IDFA”) associated with your device. If you don’t
          want your IDFA to be collected for advertising, you may either 1) purchase Doodle Lab, available in the App
          Store, which explicitly does not collect IDFA for targeted advertising, or 2) on your iOS device “Settings”
          app, turn on iOS’s “Ask App Not To Track” feature for Doodle Buddy Labs products.  With Ask App Not
          To Track on, you will still see the same number of ads, but those ads will not be aligned with your interests.
          You can find more details about how our advertising and analytics partners use and collect data at:
On our websites and in our mobile applications, we and our business and advertising service
          providers use cookies and other similar technologies (e.g., beacons, pixel tags, clear gifs, and device
          identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s). We and our service providers use these technologies to
          collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, which can include the following (and together with
          the IDFA, the “Anonymous Data”):
IP address;
the type of computer or mobile device you are
          using;
platform type (like Apple iOS or Android);
your operating system version;
your mobile
          device’s identifiers, like your MAC Address, Apple Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), and/or Android
          Advertising ID (AAID);
application performance and debugging information;
your browser type and
          language;
referring and exit pages, and URLs;
the number of clicks on an app feature or web page;
the
          amount of time spent on an app feature or web page;
domain names;
landing pages;
pages viewed
          and the order of those pages.
We may also collect or receive information about you from other
          sources like third-party information providers. We use this information along with information you provide us
          directly, for example, to serve you advertising more tailored to your interests.
INFORMATION
          SHARING
We will share your Personal Information only to our service providers who need to know that
          information to provide services to us, and then only under written agreements not allowing any further use of
          that Personal Information and only for the purposes for which you’ve provided it.
For
          Anonymous Information, we share that with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like
          analytics, analysis, hosting services, customer service, marketing, and advertising optimization. We will also
          share that information with our third-party business partners who assist us in delivering and optimizing our
          Services, such as our platform partners (Apple, Google, etc.), and may share it for other purposes related to
          our business. You can find more details about how our advertising and analytics partners use and collect data
          at:
We do not rent, sell or share any Personal Information for any other purpose except as
          expressly agreed upon by you and in the following circumstances:
As necessary, to identify,
          investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or other abuse of the
          Services;
To respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in
          connection with an investigation, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; and in the event that
          we go through a business transaction, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or
          a portion of our assets, your information may be one of the transferred assets.
By accessing or
          using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of
          information, including personal information, in and to the U.S. and other countries and territories, which may
          have different privacy laws from your country of residence.  If we have received your personal
          information under the Data Privacy Framework and subsequently transfer it to a third party service provider
          for processing, we will remain responsible if they process your personal information in a manner inconsistent
          with the Data Privacy Framework, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the
          damage.
ACCESS
If you would like access to personal information that we have
          collected in order to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed
          in violation of the Principles, please contact privacy@doodlebuddy.co.  In order to process any
          corrections, amendments or deletions of personal information, you will need to provide sufficient identifying
          information as a security precaution. In addition, we may limit or deny access to personal information where
          providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or where the rights
          of persons other than the individual would be violated.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
In
          compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Doodle Buddy Labs commits to refer unresolved
          complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S.
          DPF to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive
          timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF
          Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit the JAMS link below for more information or to
          file a complaint.  The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
Doodle
          Buddy Labs is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission
          (FTC).  An individual may, under certain conditions, invoke binding arbitration. Please see the
          EU-U.S. DPF website for more information on conditions giving rise to binding arbitration.
OPTIONS
          FOR LIMITING DISCLOSURE
We offer you a number of options and choices for limiting the use and
          disclosure of your personal data with regards to the data we collect:
Limit Ad Tracking. If you
          don’t want your IDFA (described above) to be collected for advertising, then on your iOS device “Settings,”
          you can turn on iOS’s “Limit Ad Tracking” feature. You will still see the same number of ads, but those ads
          will not be aligned with your interests.
Cookies. Most web browsers are set to accept
          cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser
          cookies. Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third party flash cookies used in
          connection with our services.  Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this
          could affect the availability and functionality of the Doodle Buddy website.
Promotional
          Communications. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or messages from Doodle Buddy Labs by
          following the instructions in those emails or messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional
          communications, such as those about our ongoing business relationship.
CHILDREN
To
          enable children to enjoy our drawing application, we’ve created Doodle Lab, available in the App Store, which
          adds more educational backgrounds and stamps, takes out some content not appropriate for children and removes
          banner advertising. Doodle Lab does not collect IDFA for advertising. All of our other Services are not
          intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 for children located in the European Union)
          (collectively, “Children”). We seek to ensure that we do not collect information from children. Except for
          Doodle Lab, children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal
          information from Children. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information that is not
          subject to a COPPA exception from a Child, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that
          information from our records.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Doodle
          Buddy Labs commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in
          reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to [INSERT name of alternative dispute resolution
          provider], an alternative dispute resolution provider based in [INSERT the United States, the European Union,
          the United Kingdom, and/or Switzerland (as applicable)].  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
          DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to
          your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework for more information or
          to file a complaint.  The services of [INSERT name of alternative dispute resolution provider] are provided at
          no cost to you.
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES
We may provide links and/or connections
          to third-party web sites or services from our websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
          content of these third-party sites.
SECURITY
We take appropriate steps to ensure
          data privacy and security through various hardware and software methodologies. However, we cannot ensure or
          warrant against all risks with regards to the security of that information, so information you choose to
          transmit to us and which we store is provided to us at your own risk and we do not guarantee that such
          information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards.
DO NOT TRACK
Currently, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” browser features, but
          we may do so in the future as industry standards evolve.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We
          may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will post the changes on our website at
          www.doodlebuddy.co and update the last updated date of this Privacy Policy. Such modifications will become

          Framework.

PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
Doodle Buddy Labs, LLC
          (“Doodle Buddy,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides this Privacy Notice pursuant to the California Consumer
          Privacy Act (“CCPA”) to inform California residents of the categories of personal information we collect and
          the purposes of collection.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
“Personal information” under the
          CCPA is information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with,
          or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device (“personal
          information”).
Since our “Doodle Buddy” and “Doodle Lab” mobile applications don’t require any
          user registration, we collect very limited personal information.  Only the following two categories
          of personal information are collected from our website and mobile applications:
• User Identification Information: Email address and full name, which we may collect if you submit a request
          to us; and
• Technical Information: such as device identifiers, which are collected not by us but by some of our
          analytics providers or advertising networks like Google (“Ad Networks”).  We don’t store any of that
          information.
We don’t actually collect any Technical Information.  The Ad Networks
          collect it from your device only if you use “Doodle Buddy” for iPhone or iPad.  If you use Doodle
          Lab, no Technical Information is collected for advertising purposes.
If you don’t want any of your
          personal information to be collected by Ad Networks for any advertising in our Doodle Buddy applications, then
          you must stop using Doodle Buddy.  You can use Doodle Lab instead for an additional charge, as
          authorized under Section 1798.125(a)(2) of the CCPA.
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may
          use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:
• To fulfill or meet the reason for which the information is provided. For example, if you contact us for
          help, we will use that information to respond to your request.
• To provide you with our products or services and ads within those products.
• To improve our website and apps and present its contents to you.
• For testing, research, analysis and product development.
• As necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our clients or others.
• To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental
          regulations.
• As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA and our
          Privacy Policy.
We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the
          personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without
          providing you notice.
SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION
We don’t share your personal
          information with anyone except as provided in our Privacy Policy.  When we disclose personal
          information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient
          to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the
          contract.
We disclose your personal information for a business purpose to the following categories of
          third parties:
• Ad networks
YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents)
          with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and
          explains how to exercise those rights.
Access to Specific Information and Data
          Portability Rights
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about
          our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Note that you may only make a
          verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Once we receive and
          confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:
• The categories of personal information we collected about you.
• The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
• Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
• The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
• The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability
          request).
• If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose:
• The categories of personal information that we’ve sold about you and the categories of third parties to whom
          the personal information was sold.
• The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose.
For
          more information about how to contact us to provide you with information request, email
          privacy@doodlebuddy.com.
DELETION REQUEST RIGHTS
You have the right to request that we
          delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain
          exceptions.
As discussed above, if you want us to delete your data, you have to send us a verified
          request for us to do so to privacy@doodlebuddy.co.
Please note that the CCPA includes a
          number of exceptions that allow us to retain your personal data despite your deletion request, so we may
          retain your personal data under those exceptions.
VERIFICATION
If you’ve sent us a
          request through our website, we may be able to verify you via email.  However, if you’re a user of
          our mobile applications, we may not have sufficient data to verify who you are since we don’t require you to
          provide us with any registration information, and we don’t actually collect the data ourselves.

          Labs is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission
          (FTC).  An individual may, under certain conditions, invoke binding arbitration. Please see the
          EU-U.S. DPF website for more information on conditions giving rise to binding arbitration.
OPTIONS
          FOR LIMITING DISCLOSURE
We offer you a number of options and choices for limiting the use and
          disclosure of your personal data with regards to the data we collect:
Limit Ad Tracking. If you
          don’t want your IDFA (described above) to be collected for advertising, then on your iOS device “Settings,”
          you can turn on iOS’s “Limit Ad Tracking” feature. You will still see the same number of ads, but those ads
          will not be aligned with your interests.
Cookies. Most web browsers are set to accept
          cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser
          cookies. Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third party flash cookies used in
          connection with our services.  Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this
          could affect the availability and functionality of the Doodle Buddy website.
Promotional
          Communications. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or messages from Doodle Buddy Labs by
          following the instructions in those emails or messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional
          communications, such as those about our ongoing business relationship.
CHILDREN
To
          enable children to enjoy our drawing application, we’ve created Doodle Lab, available in the App Store, which
          adds more educational backgrounds and stamps, takes out some content not appropriate for children and removes
          banner advertising. Doodle Lab does not collect IDFA for advertising. All of our other Services are not
          intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 for children located in the European Union)
          (collectively, “Children”). We seek to ensure that we do not collect information from children. Except for
          Doodle Lab, children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal
          information from Children. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information that is not
          subject to a COPPA exception from a Child, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that
          information from our records.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Doodle
          Buddy Labs commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in
          reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to [INSERT name of alternative dispute resolution
          provider], an alternative dispute resolution provider based in [INSERT the United States, the European Union,
          the United Kingdom, and/or Switzerland (as applicable)].  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
          DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to
          your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework for more information or
          to file a complaint.  The services of [INSERT name of alternative dispute resolution provider] are provided at
          no cost to you.
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES
We may provide links and/or connections
          to third-party web sites or services from our websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
          content of these third-party sites.
SECURITY
We take appropriate steps to ensure
          data privacy and security through various hardware and software methodologies. However, we cannot ensure or
          warrant against all risks with regards to the security of that information, so information you choose to
          transmit to us and which we store is provided to us at your own risk and we do not guarantee that such
          information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards.

Currently, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” browser features, but
          we may do so in the future as industry standards evolve.

          Framework.

PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
Doodle Buddy Labs, LLC
          (“Doodle Buddy,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides this Privacy Notice pursuant to the California Consumer
          Privacy Act (“CCPA”) to inform California residents of the categories of personal information we collect and
          the purposes of collection.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
“Personal information” under the
          CCPA is information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with,
          or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device (“personal
          information”).
Since our “Doodle Buddy” and “Doodle Lab” mobile applications don’t require any
          user registration, we collect very limited personal information.  Only the following two categories
          of personal information are collected from our website and mobile applications:
• User Identification Information: Email address and full name, which we may collect if you submit a request
          to us; and
• Technical Information: such as device identifiers, which are collected not by us but by some of our
          analytics providers or advertising networks like Google (“Ad Networks”).  We don’t store any of that
          information.
We don’t actually collect any Technical Information.  The Ad Networks
          collect it from your device only if you use “Doodle Buddy” for iPhone or iPad.  If you use Doodle
          Lab, no Technical Information is collected for advertising purposes.
If you don’t want any of your
          personal information to be collected by Ad Networks for any advertising in our Doodle Buddy applications, then
          you must stop using Doodle Buddy.  You can use Doodle Lab instead for an additional charge, as
          authorized under Section 1798.125(a)(2) of the CCPA.
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may
          use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:
• To fulfill or meet the reason for which the information is provided. For example, if you contact us for
          help, we will use that information to respond to your request.
• To provide you with our products or services and ads within those products.
• To improve our website and apps and present its contents to you.
• For testing, research, analysis and product development.
• As necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our clients or others.
• To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental
          regulations.
• As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA and our
          Privacy Policy.
We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the
          personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without
          providing you notice.
SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION
We don’t share your personal
          information with anyone except as provided in our Privacy Policy.  When we disclose personal
          information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient
          to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the
          contract.
We disclose your personal information for a business purpose to the following categories of
          third parties:
• Ad networks
YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents)
          with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and
          explains how to exercise those rights.
Access to Specific Information and Data
          Portability Rights
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about
          our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Note that you may only make a
          verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Once we receive and
          confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:
• The categories of personal information we collected about you.
• The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
• Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
• The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
• The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability
          request).
• If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose:
• The categories of personal information that we’ve sold about you and the categories of third parties to whom
          the personal information was sold.
• The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose.
For
          more information about how to contact us to provide you with information request, email
          privacy@doodlebuddy.com.
DELETION REQUEST RIGHTS
You have the right to request that we
          delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain
          exceptions.
As discussed above, if you want us to delete your data, you have to send us a verified
          request for us to do so to privacy@doodlebuddy.co.
Please note that the CCPA includes a
          number of exceptions that allow us to retain your personal data despite your deletion request, so we may
          retain your personal data under those exceptions.
VERIFICATION
If you’ve sent us a
          request through our website, we may be able to verify you via email.  However, if you’re a user of
          our mobile applications, we may not have sufficient data to verify who you are since we don’t require you to
          provide us with any registration information, and we don’t actually collect the data ourselves.
