OSnap! Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 10/07/2024
Introduction
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we may collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data. By using the OSnap! app, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
Information We Collect
OSnap! does not collect or store any personal information directly. The primary function of OSnap! is to allow you to create time-lapse and stop motion projects on your iOS device. However, when using features that interact with third-party services, some data may be shared with those platforms.
Third-Party Integrations
OSnap! allows users to share their videos and photos directly to third-party services. When you use this feature, some data (such as the video or photo you are sharing) may be transmitted to those third-party platforms. OSnap! does not have control over how these third-party platforms handle your data. We encourage you to review privacy policy of these third-party services for more information on their data practices.
Analytics and Tracking
OSnap! uses anonymous analytics tools to help improve the appâ€™s performance and user experience. These tools may collect non-personal data such as app usage patterns and crash reports. No personal information is collected through these analytics services.
Your Data and Rights
Since OSnap! does not collect personal information, we do not store, share, or sell any personal data. If you have any concerns or questions about how your data is handled, please contact us at

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or applicable laws. When we make changes, the "Effective Date" at the top of this page will be updated. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
