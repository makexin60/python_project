Privacy Policy
TripView respects your privacy, and we only collect the minimum amount of information necessary to operate the TripView service.
Trip Settings
Your trip settings are stored on your phone. We don't keep any records of
    your trip settings on our servers, apart from transient request logs mentioned
    below.
When you view a trip, the app needs to transmit some details to the TripView
    servers in order to request real-time data. This typically includes the list of
    routes and stops that are relevant to your trip. All communications between the
    app and our servers are encrypted.
The TripView servers keep logs of all requests for security and diagnostic
    purposes. These logs include the IP address of every request, but are
    otherwise anonymous. Request logs are automatically deleted on a regular
    basis.
We may analyse request logs to gather anonymous usage statistics, including
    request counts and general usage patterns.
If you use the app to send an email to TripView Support, you will have the
    option to include your trip settings as an attachment. We will only use this
    information for troubleshooting, and it will be deleted on request.
Analytics
TripView uses the Google Firebase service to collect anonymous
    usage information, including the number of active users, device models, and
    operating system versions.
We also use a third party service to collect crash reports. These
    reports are used to diagnose and fix crashes. They do not contain any personal
    information.
Advertising
The free version of TripView contains advertisements provided by third party
    advertising services. These advertising services may use the advertising ID
    from the device to provide personalised ads. They may also use the current
    location of the device to provide location based advertising.
