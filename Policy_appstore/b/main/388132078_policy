Workhuman Privacy Policy
Hi Humans!
SEE OUR PRIVACY SNAPSHOT
Thank you for taking the time to review our Privacy Policy. After reviewing our Privacy Policy, if you still have questions about the use of your personal information, please contact us at
privacy@workhuman.com
.
Globoforce Inc. d/b/a Workhuman (US) and Globoforce Limited trading as Workhuman (Ireland) (“Workhuman”, “us”, or “we”) are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with our obligations under applicable law (including, with the
					EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”)). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect your personal information on the program site that links to this Privacy Policy (the “Site”), how we protect such information and the
					choices and rights you have concerning your information.
Please remember that this Privacy Policy only applies to personal information collected by Workhuman pursuant to your use of the Site including upon redemption of GloboCertificates on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to
					personal information we process on behalf of your employer to provide the services under our agreement with your employer. We want to ensure you’re aware that your employer is responsible for such personal information, and we only process
					such personal information under their instructions. For any questions related to the personal information we process on behalf of your employer, or if you no longer wish for us to receive your personal information from your employer, please
					contact your program manager.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of websites that are owned or controlled by third parties.
Type of Personal Information We Collect
We collect personal information as described below. As used in this policy,
Personal Information
is information that you provide to us on the Site that identifies or relates to or could reasonably be linked to or
					associated with you.
Personal information you provide:
The personal information we collect from you may include:
Identifiers
such as your name, address, personal email address, or telephone number.
Commercial information
such as redemption data including your GloboCertificate balance (award balance), and your redemption selections.
Content
you choose to upload, such as attachments, files, forms or documents including videos and/or photos.
Personal information from other sources:
We receive personal information from your employer, which we may combine with the personal information you provide, to provide the services as described in the ‘How We Use Your
					Personal Information’ section below.
Automatically collected data:
We automatically collect certain information when you use the Site (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) addresses), including through the use of cookies and other similar technologies. We explain the
					cookies we use and why we use them in our
Cookies Policy.
How We Use Your Personal Information
We only keep and process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so. The purposes and bases we rely on are as follows:
To deliver our services in accordance with our contractual obligations:
When you use the Site, we process your personal information (combined with any personal information we receive from your employer) for the purposes
						of opening and administering your account, operating your program, fulfilling your orders, responding to your requests and/or communicating with you about your orders.
In support of our legitimate interests:
We may also process your personal information where it is in line with our legitimate interests, but we will not rely on this basis if your rights and interests would override
						ours. Examples of our legitimate interests and how we balance them with your rights include the following:
Tracking Emails: Workhuman may track and collect information through emails that we send to you. This may include whether an email is opened, and links you click on in the email. To balance our interests with yours, we will not
								share this information with your employer, and some emails have no tracking at all. However, the ability to track and collect this information allows us to understand how our services are meeting your needs.
Analytics: We undertake data analytics to understand how our users are interacting with the Site and how we can improve and develop our services. Our analytics are generally conducted on an aggregated, pseudonymized or anonymous
								basis so as to reduce the privacy impact for individuals.
Protecting the Site and the services: Workhuman may use personal information to prevent fraud, criminal activity, or misuse of our services, to ensure the security of our IT systems, architecture and networks (including
								troubleshooting, testing, system maintenance, support and hosting of data), and to investigate and protect against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity
With your consent:
For example, if your employer asks us to conduct a survey, we may invite you to participate. All survey questions are optional; there is no requirement that you answer all or any of the questions
						asked. While Workhuman will not identify your name or email address to your employer as someone who was invited to participate or who did/did not participate, you should not include personal information in your responses to surveys if you
						do not wish for this information to be seen by your employer. We may also invite you to participate in voluntary email surveys to evaluate your interaction with our customer service team or to ask you questions about your use of the Site
						which helps us improve our services.
Where we have a legal obligation.
We may also use your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so to comply with an applicable law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order or
						other valid legal process or lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
How We Share Personal Information
Your personal information will be shared in the manner described herein. For example, under our agreement with your employer, we may share information with your employer about the fact that you have availed yourself of the services.
					However, we believe that your specific redemption data (such redemption data may be referred to as “Participant Data” under our agreement with your employer and is data entered by you related to the redemption of GloboCertificates and
					includes, but is not limited to, your outstanding GloboCertificate balance, your purchase preferences and any personal contact details provided) is personal to you and we will not share this information with your employer.
We may share your personal information with other entities in the context of (i) a change of ownership of Workhuman’s assets or business, (ii) as required to deliver a service to you, such as when we may share your information with our
					third-party service providers if it is necessary to deliver our service, or fulfill or redeem a GloboCertificate, or (iii) where we are under a legal obligation, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to do so.
					A list of our third-party service providers can be found here:
Participant Subprocessor List.
We do not and will not sell, trade or rent
					your personal information to third parties or share your personal information to third parties for targeted advertising. As a participant of the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF"), Workhuman is responsible for onward transfers to
					third parties that occur under the EU-U.S DPF.
How You Share Your Personal Information
Certain of our services that you may have access to allow you to upload Content as described in the “Types of Personal Information We Collect” section above. Once uploaded, Content may be accessible to your company’s program managers, HR
					staff and others who the company may designate from time to time. Other Content (for example, videos and/or photos uploaded with an award message), may be viewed by your colleagues and all other users in your program. You should not upload
					any Content that (i) contains personal information that you do not wish to disclose to your company or to us or (ii) is not appropriate to upload (such as where it includes personal information relating to others without their consent, or
					where it contains confidential information that would violate any duties of confidentiality you owe to your employer or any third party). Please note, your employer is responsible for the processing of this category of information, and we
					only process such information under their instructions. If you have a question about whether you should upload Content, please contact your employer for guidance.
Workhuman Experiences
If Workhuman Experiences (“Experiences”) is available on your Site and you choose to use Experiences, your personal information will be provided to Workhuman’s third party partner, Switchfly, LLC (“Switchfly”), pursuant to this Privacy
					Policy. We work jointly with Switchfly to ensure your requirements can be met in as seamless a manner as possible. If you choose to redeem your GloboCertificates on Experiences, the Switchfly Privacy Policy will be made available to you and
					it will apply to any data processing activity Switchfly undertakes in order to provide you with the booking you have requested. We have an agreement with Switchfly which ensures that your data protection rights are respected at all times,
					whether the use of your personal information is controlled by Workhuman and/or Switchfly. If the responsible controller is not clear in any specific context, please contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below and we will
					do our best to provide clarification.
International Data Transfers
Workhuman is a global business with headquarters in Ireland and in the US. Workhuman may transfer personal information to countries other than the country in which you are located, including the US. These countries may not have the same
					data protection laws as the country in which you are located. However, when we transfer your personal information to other countries, we protect that information in accordance with applicable law. For example, the principal way in which we
					protect personal information subject to the GDPR that may be transferred outside of the EEA or the UK to the United States is through Workhuman’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the
					EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and/or UK government-approved international data transfer agreements. Workhuman certifies to the U.S. Department of
					Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal information received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United
					Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Workhuman has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with
					regard to the processing of personal information received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF
					Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
and to view our certification,
					please visit

. Please contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below if you require further information on our international
					transfers.
Your Rights to your Information
You may also have various rights in relation to your information. Where they relate to information held by your employer (and where Workhuman processes such information only on behalf of your employer), you should contact your employer to
					exercise your rights. Where required under the laws that apply in your place of residence, you may request the following in relation to your personal information that we control:
Information: You may request information about how we have collected and used your personal information. We have made this information available to you without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.
Inspection and access: You can request a summary and/or a copy of personal information we hold about you.
Correction/addition/removal: Where you believe your information is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to request us to correct, amend or delete it.
Portability: You may request that we send you any personal information that you have provided to us or ask that we send this information to a third party.
Objection: You may object to us using your personal information where we use it based on our legitimate interests to do so.
Restriction: You may request that we restrict the processing of your personal information where you believe it is inaccurate, our processing is unlawful, you believe we no longer need the information or if you have objected to our use
						of it.
Automated Decision Making: Where we undertake automated decision making (including profiling), which significantly affects you, you are entitled to object to such decision-making. (We do not ordinarily undertake this type of
						processing.)
Withdraw Consent: In circumstances where we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw such consent by contacting us as indicated below.
To make a request, please use the contact details provided in the “Contact Us” section below. We may ask for specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit
					requests on their behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in accordance with applicable laws. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.
In some instances, your choices and rights may be limited, such as where fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our ability to provide a service you have requested, or our ability to comply with our legal obligations
					and enforce our legal rights.
Depending on your request above and the personal information in question, it may be our legal and contractual duty to contact your employer. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law.
Children
Our services are not directed to children. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us through the Site, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our
					databases.
Security
Workhuman is committed to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security of your information. We have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We maintain data
					security systems designed to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our employees are made aware of and are accountable for compliance with our Privacy Policy. When applicable,
					we use a multi-factor authentication security system to control access to information stored about users. We also maintain the physical security of our properties and facilities.
Retention of Personal Information
We keep personal information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g., for tax, legal, accounting, or other purposes),
					whichever is longer.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Site so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and how we share it. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a
					manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy or otherwise disclosed to you at the time it was collected, we will notify you as required by applicable laws. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy
					Policy that generally will not affect our use of your personal information.
Concerns and Comments
If you wish to exercise your data protection rights or to raise any concerns, objections or complaints in relation to this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the relevant “Contact Us” details below. If contacting us does not resolve
					your issue, EU users of the Site may contact their local EU Data Protection Authorities, Swiss users can contact the Swiss Data Protection and Information Commissioner, and UK users can contact the UK Information Commissioner’s Office
					(collectively, “DPAs”). Workhuman commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of the panel established by the EU DPAs, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA) and the Swiss Federal
					Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF.
					In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Workhuman’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. It is open to you, under certain conditions, to invoke binding
					arbitration for complaints regarding Workhuman’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF where we cannot resolve matters under any of the other mechanisms set out by the EU-U.S. DPF. For
					additional information, please visit:
