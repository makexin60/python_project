1. Information Collection
A. Information You Provide.
We collect personal information from you when you use the Services. “Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably
capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

B. Information Automatically Collected.
We also collect certain information automatically when you visit the Services (“Usage Information”), including:
• Your browser type and operating system;
• Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;
• Geolocation information, including precise information;
• Transaction data on items you purchase on our site or through our partners;
• Other unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers;
• Sites or mobile apps you used before and after using the Services;

• Information about your interactions with e-mail messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and
• Standard Server Log Information.
We may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to automatically collect Usage Information:
o
Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser. You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or features on the Services.
Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device.
o
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
o
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location, understanding the geographic distribution of our users, and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.
o
Device Fingerprinting
Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.
o
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps. You can stop all collection of information via our mobile applications by uninstalling them. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device and/or Slate’s iOS or Android mobile applications.
For further information on tracking technologies and your choices regarding them, please see Section 6 below.
o
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.
We allow outside entities to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information through the Services. For example, our vendors may use these technologies to collect information (i) that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics, and (ii) that is used to serve advertisements on our Services and across the Internet and on other apps tailored to your apparent interests. To the extent we combine information from outside services with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, the information collected and stored by outside entities remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on third party services.
We use various analytics services that may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the website, compile reports on the website’s activity, and provide other services related to website activity and usage. These technologies may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The information generated by these providers will be transmitted to and stored by them and will be subject to their privacy policies. For a full list of third party partners with links to their privacy policies and opt-out options, including analytics services, see our
Third Party Partners
page.
You may choose whether to receive interest-based advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices
, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. You can also opt out of interest-based advertising within mobile apps based on advertising identifiers on your device (for example, through cross-app tracking). See the Advertising and Privacy options under your device’s Settings for more information. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Slate is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information and Do Not Track Disclosures.
Some web browsers may transmit signals such as “do-not-track” (DNT) or Global Privacy Control (GPC) to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear (especially with DNT), whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Slate will endeavor to take action in response to these signals.
Globally, Slate will interpret the browser “do-not-track” signal as an opt-out signal of the Sale of Personal Information to the US Privacy API. For more information on “do-not-track” and Global Privacy Control, visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com
and

Exercising Your Rights
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes those rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
You may exercise your California rights by emailing a verifiable consumer request to privacy@slate.com, or you may use this
form
to request deletion of your information.
You are not required to create an account with us in order to submit a verifiable consumer request. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
﻿Request to Access Your Personal Information
You have the right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we share it. To protect our customers’ personal information, we are required to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
As part of our verification process of your request we ensure reasonable measures are in place to detect fraudulent requests and prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. We are required to verify your identity, and the identity of your authorized agent, if the request is submitted via an agent by associating the information provided in the request to any personal information previously collected by us or use a third-party identity verification service.
We will disclose the following information to you upon receiving your verifiable request:
• The categories of personal information we collected about you.
• Specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.
• The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
• Our business purpose for collecting that personal information.
• The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
• The categories of personal information that were disclosed or sold to third parties.
• Our business or commercial purpose for selling or disclosing the personal information, if applicable.
Requests to Delete Your Personal Information (Right to Request Deletion)
You have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete any of your personal information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. You may submit such a request as described below. To protect our customers’ personal information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.
Submitting Request to Know or Delete
To exercise the rights described above, you can contact us by submitting your request by:
• Send an email to privacy@slate.com
• Submit your request online using
this form
Only you or your authorized agent may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf, we may require that you (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so, and (2) provide a copy of the authorization or provide a copy of a power of attorney that complies with California Probate Code so that we can verify the identity of the authorized agent.
In verifying requests, we employ reasonable measures to detect fraudulent requests and prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. To meet our obligations, we are required to verify your identity, and the identity of your authorized agent, if the request is submitted via an agent, by associating the information provided in your request to personal information previously collected by us.
If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from the password-protected account, we may decline a request or request that you provide further verifying information.
We will not require you to create an account with us in order to make a request.  We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
• Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
• Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
For all verifiable consumer requests, we will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at privacy@slate.com.
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt, though we will respond to sales opt-out requests withing fifteen (15) days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Right to Opt Out of the Sale of Personal Information to Third Parties
You have the right to opt out of any sale of your personal information to third parties.
To exercise this right, please visit our “
Do Not Share or Sell My Personal Information
” page. Please note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing of personal information with service providers, who are parties we engage to perform a function on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use the personal information only for that function.
