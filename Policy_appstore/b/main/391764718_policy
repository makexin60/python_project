Ways Bad Elf Collects and Uses Personal Information
"Personal Information" is information that, either alone or in combination with other information collected, identifies an individual. When we combine other information (i.e., information that does not, on its own, identify an individual) with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.
When you Create a Bad Elf Account
When you create an account on a Bad Elf website or mobile app, we ask you to provide Personal Information, including your name and email address. You do not need to provide your full name, but you may if you wish. You will use your email address and your password to login to your account. Your Bad Elf account will be password-protected. We use your name to help verify your account when you call customer support.
When You Buy Products on a Bad Elf Website
If you purchase a product on a Bad Elf site, then Bad Elf will collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, mailing address and telephone number, so that we can process your order and fulfill your purchase. We do not view or store your payment card information. A third party, Shopify, processes customer payment card information when Bad Elf customers use a payment card to make a purchase on a Bad Elf site. We recommend you carefully review
Shopify’s Privacy Policy
.
When you Communicate with Bad Elf
When you interact with our customer support representatives via email, telephone or in person, we may collect Personal Information, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and contact preferences; and information about the Bad Elf products you own, such as their serial numbers and date of purchase. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance related issues, and capture information relating to the support or service issue. We use this information to provide you with customer and product support. We may access your Bad Elf account in order to assist us in providing you the necessary assistance. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives, and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys.
We may use Personal Information to communicate with you, including communicating with you about your account or transactions with us, giving you important information about your products or apps, sending you notice about material changes to this Privacy Statement, and, consistent with applicable laws and the choices available to you as described below under Your Choices regarding Marketing Correspondence, sending you offers and promotions for our products and apps.

When you Use Your Bad Elf GPS Receiver Device or App
If you use a Bad Elf auto navigation device or app and provide your consent when asked, then Bad Elf will collect and upload from your device data such as location, speed, direction, and time and date of recording.
