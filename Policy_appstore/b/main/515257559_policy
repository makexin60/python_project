Privacy Policy
Overview
Below you will find our Privacy Policy which tells you about how we will process your personal data and about rights that you have under data protection. We strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with this Privacy Policy. However, we understand that people have busy lives and so want to provide you with a quick overview of how we will use your personal data – please remember though that this first section is an overview only and should not be read instead of reading the full Privacy Policy below.
We process your personal data for the purposes discussed in detail below, but the two main purposes are to enable us to provide you with services and to comply with our regulatory obligations, specifically:
On the first of these, in order for us to offer you with services we will need you to register a user account and provide bank details to deposit money.
On the regulatory aspect, we are required to monitor our customers and to keep records of transactions to ensure that we are offering a fair, responsible and safe service – and this includes verifying your age and monitoring our customers to ensure that they are gambling within their means.
