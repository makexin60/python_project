INTELLILIST PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy is effective on November 01, 2018. This Privacy Policy is written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this Privacy Policy conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Ameridea services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to submit content, including images, item names and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").
Information we collect
When you use our service we do not automatically collect any personal data. We do not use cookies or other tracking technologies. We only collect information you provide us directly:
1. User Content (e.g., images, item names, package sizes and other information) that you post to the Service.
2. Your name and e-mail address when you contact us for support.
How we use your information
In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:
1. Provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service.
2. Develop and test new products and features.
3. Diagnose or fix technology problems.
4. Provide support.
Sharing of your information
We will not disclose your email address, or other personal information we see from support requests, to anyone unless we reasonably believe it is necessary to comply with a subpoena, court order, law, or regulation. We may disclose your personal information to the extent required to fulfill our legal obligation.
How we store your information
We do not store any data on servers under our control. To sync lists and items a user can choose to use the Dropbox service. To manage information about items and barcodes we use Apple's iCloud service. Both Dropbox and iCloud are GDPR-compliant services.
All personal information is collected via HTTPS secure communication and is kept in a secure database that is not subject to any unauthorized usage. We employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Business transfer
If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Ameridea or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
Ameridea may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. Your continued use of Ameridea or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.

Although it is Ameridea’s intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Ameridea reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Ameridea, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable. Consequently, Ameridea encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Ameridea is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Ameridea will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.

You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Ameridea is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Ameridea in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Ameridea, and Ameridea will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.
7. It is Ameridea’s policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Ameridea does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Ameridea is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.
