Photo Transfer App -
Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs your use of the
Photo Transfer App
(the “
Application
”) created by
Mobileware Studio SL
for use on a mobile device. The Application allows users to transfer photos and videos directly from one mobile device to another device or computer using a Wi-Fi network or bluetooth communication. The photos transferred are not stored on any intermediary server at any point – all transfers are executed directly device to device.
Data controller:
Mobileware Studio SL
NIF: B02821767
Paseo de la Castellana 194
28046 Madrid

What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
The Application may collect certain information about you automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application in order to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Application and so we can provide you with a better user experience (the “Automatically Collected Information”).
Mobileware Studio SL. informs that the personal data that we process is collected in order to manage the relationship that unites both parties and to be able to provide the requested service.
The personal data provided will be kept as long as the contractual relationship is maintained, and once the aforementioned relationship ends, it will be blocked for the legally established time, before its destruction.
If you want to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask you to provide your email address and certain other information. In that case, this information may be shared with our third party service providers. Mobileware Studio SL and our service providers will use this information only in connection with providing you the newsletter and for no other purpose. You may remove yourself from our newsletter email list by following the “Unsubscribe” directions included in each newsletter you receive.
Other than the information you may choose to provide in order to subscribe to our newsletter, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you. In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number or email address. This Application does not collect information about the location of your mobile device. If you are using iOS5 on your device, the Application may ask you to enable Location Services so the Application can read photos stored on your devices that have location information stored on them. We do not use location information for any purpose other than being able to access the photos stored on your device as required by Apple.
Third Parties
Third party analytics providers may access data on our behalf. We may work with analytics companies such as Localytics and Google Analytics to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage, the type of device being used and other non-personally identifiable information so we can deliver a better experience and improve the Application.
We may disclose Automatically Collected Information:
- as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
- when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
- with trusted service providers who work on or behalf; and
- if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third- parties that may collect information about your use of the Application. For example, Apple and Google collect information about those who obtain the Application through their services, and may make this information available to Mobileware Studio SL. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such third-parties for more information.
As for third-party providers contracted to provide an adequate service, we have providers outside the European framework, exactly in the US. We use the cloud service of Amazon, inc. for “send to someone” functionality. The files uploaded by the user to the cloud are deleted after 15 days. For more information, consult the privacy policy of Amazon, inc.
Children
We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at
info@phototransferapp.com
. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.
Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here:
www.phototransferapp.com/privacy/app/
. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted. Your use of the Application, and your continued use after we post a revised Privacy Policy, signifies your acceptance of the Privacy Policy and any revisions. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
Your Consent
By using the Application, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy, including the collection of Automatically Collected Information, as described in this Privacy Policy now and as it may be amended.
Rights of the interested parties

In certain circumstances, the interested parties may request the limitation of the processing of their data, in which case only the Responsible will keep them for the exercise or defense of claims.
In certain circumstances and for reasons related to their particular situation, the interested parties may object to the processing of their data.
In certain circumstances, by virtue of the portability right, the interested parties will have the right to obtain their personal data in a structured format of common use and mechanical reading and transmit it to another person in charge.
