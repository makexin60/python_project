Privacy Policy
Hemisphere Games, Inc. (“we” or “Hemisphere”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. By using the service offered through the Osmos mobile game (the “Osmos App”), you accept and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We provide this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Osmos App.
Hemisphere does not collect, transmit, share, or store any user information through the Osmos App. No Personally Identifiable Information entered into the Osmos App will be collected or transmitted anywhere.
Osmos accesses a player’s Game Center account for the purposes of updating achievements, and for online multiplayer matchmaking. Players may also post their achievements to Twitter or Facebook from within Osmos, but only when initiated and confirmed by the user.
Osmos may access a player’s microphone and/or camera if they choose to record or broadcast video from within Osmos with those options enabled.
Osmos synchronizes players’ progress to their iCloud account so it can be shared across devices. This can be disabled within Osmos or in your device’s iCloud settings.
