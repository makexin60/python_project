Tickets are subject to availability and are generally non-refundable. We are under no obligation to refund you or exchange your ticket(s) in the event that you make any error when purchasing your tickets (including but not limited to selecting the wrong film or the wrong number of tickets), if you are excluded from viewing the film for any breach of these Ticket Terms or the Guest Admission Policy, or if your ticket is lost, stolen or damaged. However, we may, entirely at our discretion, refund you or exchange your ticket(s) in any of the situations mentioned above or where there has been any customer service issue that we consider warrants a full or partial refund or other offer of goodwill from us. Please note that, unless otherwise specified, any such refund will exclude any additional amounts paid for other items such as food and drink, merchandise or 3D glasses. Refunds will be made to the same payment card used to make the booking (or in cash if you paid for the tickets in cash
provided the refund occurs before or on the same day as the screening
) and cannot be returned to gift cards. Redeemed voucher codes cannot be re-used if the tickets they were used to purchase are refunded or exchanged.

Seating is unallocated unless otherwise specified at the point of purchase. Where seating is allocated at the time of purchase, we will endeavour to ensure that you are provided with the seat that you have purchased. However, we cannot guarantee the seating allocation and shall reserve the right to make changes at our discretion.

For 3D films, you may purchase 3D glasses at your chosen cinema. You will receive a voucher for your 3D glasses, which you can take to any designated collection point in the cinema to collect your 3D glasses before the film.
