Your privacy is important to Agile Sports Technologies, Inc., dba Hudl and its subsidiaries (“Hudl”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), and Hudl is committed to the protection of your personal information. Our Privacy Policy exists to help you understand what information Hudl collects, how we collect and use it, and what choices you have. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Hudl employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company. Please read this Privacy Policy before visiting our websites, accessing or using our services or products (including our websites, platforms, mobile applications, software and other services and Hudl manufactured devices) or providing any personal information to Hudl. If you do not wish to have your information used and disclosed as provided in this Privacy Policy, please refrain from providing your information and/or delete the information you may have submitted in the past. In doing so, please understand that your access to information, services and other benefits may be substantially limited. Further assistance is available via email to

.
If you use Hudl’s products or services, further information may also be provided in your contract with us. If you are an employee, worker or contractor of Hudl, the information about how we handle your personal information is available in the Hudl Handbook. With respect to employees based in Europe, we are committed to cooperating with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship. We do not collect social security or equivalent national tax ID numbers, except for employment purposes. If you are a prospective employee or job applicant of Hudl, we will provide you with information about how we handle your personal information for recruitment purposes. This will be provided to you if you commence any of our recruitment initiatives.
1. Collection and Use of Personal Information
Personal information is data relating to a person that can be used to help uniquely identify them, either directly or indirectly. We may collect personal information from and about you, including information that you provide, automatically collected information, and information from other sources. You may be asked to provide personal information when in contact with Hudl. If you do not provide us with certain requested personal information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of Hudl’s products and services.
Hudl may use your personal information to provide and customize our products and services, to process your transactions when you place an order through our products or services, to provide customer support, to communicate with you, to administer and improve our products and services, to maintain security and prevent fraud, to meet our legal obligations, or otherwise where you direct us or give us consent to use your personal information. Hudl may send you periodic marketing and promotional emails, push notifications, or text messages to your mobile device (about Hudl products or services or third party products or services), and we will obtain your consent to do so, where required by law. If you no longer wish to receive our marketing and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by following the opt-out instructions included in any communication that you receive from us or by contacting support@hudl.com. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving marketing and promotional communications from us, we may still send you administrative and transactional messages from which you cannot opt out.
We may use your personal information for purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Hudl’s products, services, and customer communications. Hudl and its partners may share your personal information and use it as described in this Privacy Policy. Such information may be combined with other information to provide and improve products, services, content, and advertising. This Privacy Policy does not cover and is not intended to restrict what we do with information that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, so it is no longer associated with an individually identifiable user. Please note that we may combine personal information that we collect (as described above) with information from other sources and use the combined information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Certain products and services of Hudl may use the YouTube API Services to allow you to authorize Hudl to connect to your YouTube account in order to livestream using YouTube. Any personal information you provide when using the YouTube API Services is governed by the Google Privacy Policy (

You may unsubscribe from this content by following the steps detailed in the email footer or by contacting

.
We may receive and store certain types of website usage information when you visit our websites. Website usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive, what type of content is most popular and which visitors are interested in particular content and advertising. We may collect the page visited, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other information about your engagement with our site and services. We may also collect your IP address and your Device Identifier. A Device Identifier is a number automatically assigned to the computer, cell phone or tablet used to access the Internet. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide.
If you wear a wearable device manufactured by us, certain information such as the following may be captured by the device automatically: GPS and positioning information, acceleration, metadata on workouts, duration of your physical activity, and, if using an external device, resting heart rate, heart rate variability, skin temperature, blood oxygen saturation level, and data reflecting on strain and recovery. You may also provide us with physiological profile information, including birthday, gender, weight, height, and fitness/athlete level. This information can be accessed by the athlete, coaches and team administrators. We may use certain of this information to customize your experience with us as part of our products and services.
When you browse our website(s), we may collect information about you, regardless of whether you have created a registered user account. However, if you choose to access our websites anonymously, we may not be able to provide you with particular products or services. We collect and store personal information if you provide any such personal information, register as a user, provide details at an event, complete a survey or supply personal details through any other form of correspondence. Hudl uses this information to provide products and services, as well as for billing, identification, authentication, products and services improvement, contact and research purposes. This information may include: date, time, computer identity, crash data, device type and setting, operating system, language, region, log preferences, registration key, license level, license code, license code status, code registration date, last validation date, Ethernet address, IP address, MAC address, licensed software name and version, OS version, and any other information about user actions required to improve, support and maintain our software.
In some cases, you may provide information to us about other people, such as employees, students, team members, family members and athletes. For example, if you fill out an Athlete Profile Page (described below) or upload or capture game video.
We may receive personal information about you from third parties, including from licensors of game video, our customers who create user-generated content (including Athlete Profile Page information, messages, comments, photographs, livestreams, audio recordings, videos and text that users of our products and services choose to create or capture with or upload to our products and services), our payment processors, our partners who assist us in fraud prevention or in connection with claims or disputes, our partners with whom we work for advertising measurement, attribution, and analytics and from publicly available sources, among other sources. When you pay for products and services of ours using a credit card or other payment method, your credit card or other payment information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processors. For example, if you pay with a credit card, the payment information that you provide through our services is transmitted directly to our payment processor. We may receive limited information about your payment card from our payment processors. Our payment processors will collect the financial information necessary to process your payments in accordance with the payment processor’s respective services agreement and privacy policy.
3. Athlete Profile Pages
These pages may contain and therefore collect: name, home and email addresses, phone number, school (name, city and state), graduation year, GPA, ACT/SAT scores, transcripts, parent/guardian information (name, relation, email and phone), age, birth date, photograph, height, weight, jersey number, Twitter handle, sports position, performance scores (40-yard dash, agility shuffle, power ball, vertical jump), speed and strength information, sports awards, sports videos featuring the athlete, and other athlete profile information, as may be updated from time to time. This information can be accessed by the athlete, coaches and team administrators. Verified recruiters may access the profile information of athletes located outside the EU and of those athletes inside the EU that have affirmatively consented to this. The general public may have limited access to athlete profile information based on administrator selected privacy settings. Home and email addresses, phone number, GPA, ACT/SAT scores, transcripts, parent/guardian information (name, relation, email and phone), age, birth date, graduation year and sports awards are not available to the general public by default.
4. Hudl Fan
Certain Hudl products and services allow individuals (“Hudl Fans”) to view games, highlights and other content posted and made available for viewing by organization customers and their users (“Organization Content”). This includes livestreamed and archived game video, among other content. Hudl Fans may be able to view some limited content without creating an account; however, most content requires a registered Hudl account in order to view it.
A Hudl Fan account is not associated with an organization customer of Hudl, and a Hudl Fan is not a user of any organization customer of Hudl. For Hudl Fans, we may share your name, email address, how you logged in (such as through a social media login but not your login information) and details of the particular organization’s Organization Content you viewed or purchased with that particular organization.
As a registered Hudl Fan, you may be able to buy tickets to a live event from an organization customer of Hudl. Hudl may share your full name, email address and the number of tickets you have purchased with the organization customer of Hudl offering the live event. Hudl may also share with the organization any support inquiries you have made related to tickets for live events, and your personal information, with such organization.
5. Data Storage
Hudl uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage and related technology required to run the Hudl website, and such third-party vendors may collect and store your data on behalf of Hudl. Hudl owns the code, databases and all rights therein. Hudl incorporates reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your personal information. However, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission, or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that Hudl cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit via its websites and/or products, and you do so at your own risk. The websites are general audience websites.

We will delete any information later determined to have been collected from an underage user. Coaches and Account Administrators may add underage users to a team roster and/or direct invite codes to such users only with express written consent from a parent or legal guardian. Hudl is not liable for obtaining such consent on behalf of a team.
8. Web Beacons
Our website uses techniques (generally, single-pixel images embedded in a web page) called “web beacons.” Web beacons allow Hudl and third parties to monitor and collect information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document, email message or other communication, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the Device Identifier that the web beacon is sent to, and the time the web beacon was viewed. Hudl uses web beacons to count web browsers, visits and page views. It also uses beacons to monitor traffic and conversion patterns, to personalize your experience, including advertising and content, and to determine whether or not messages were opened, links were clicked or notifications/offers were acted upon.
9. Cookies
A “cookie” is a small amount of data that often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer’s hard drive. When you access this website, cookies may be sent to your web browser and stored on your computer or mobile device. We use cookies to record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor our websites to your interests. Information supplied by cookies can help us to understand the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. It also helps us to recognize when you are signed in to your Hudl account and to provide a more personalized experience. Additionally, Hudl uses cookies to serve some targeted advertising. To help promote Hudl teams and athletes, we sometimes embed content from social media and other third-party websites. These may include Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, SoundCloud, Spotify, Instagram, and Flickr. As a result, when you visit a page containing such content, you may be presented with cookies from these websites and these third-party cookies may track your use of the Hudl website. Hudl does not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party's website for more information.
10. Hosted Service Partners and Their Privacy Options
Our major network advertising partners include Facebook, Google, Twitter, LiveRamp, Amobee, and their respective advertising networks. These partners may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. If you wish to restrict, remove or refuse to accept cookies which are set by any website (including this website), you should do this through the browser settings for each browser you use to access the Internet. The Help function within your browser should tell you how to do so. For further information about how to restrict, remove, and refuse to accept cookies, visit

Hudl is not responsible for the privacy practices of any website that it does not own or otherwise control, and you should read the privacy policies of websites owned and controlled by others before deciding whether to proceed.
11. Tracking
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. We respond to “do not track” signals as required by applicable law.
12. Third Party Websites
Some links on the Hudl websites may redirect you to third-party websites and services that we do not operate. We may also offer social sharing tools that let you share actions on the Hudl website with other websites and vice versa. The privacy practices of these websites and services will be governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy policies before disclosing any personal information to them.
Online training sessions are governed by the privacy policy of a separate company. If you attend an online training session, we will disclose to you the separate company providing the training platform.
13. Messaging and Notifications
Hudl’s private messaging tools (“Hudl Messaging”) are available to Hudl subscribers. Messages may be between one sender and one or more recipients. Hudl Messaging enables users to have conversations with athletes, coaches, family members (if available), custom groups, the whole team on the same Hudl roster, or the whole organization (if available). Hudl Messaging is intended for use that includes, but is not limited to, sending reminders about practice times, requesting feedback from the team, discussing game strategy, or sharing links to training resources.
Hudl Messaging may allow users to invite family members to conversations. If a family member is approved by a team administrator or coach to be associated with a team for your organization, then the family member can participate in Hudl Messaging to the extent allowed by the organization administrator.
When a message is sent, all participants in the conversation (except the sender) receive a notification within Hudl Messaging that they have a new unread message.
Once a message is deleted from the sender’s personal account, it is deleted from the recipient(s’) account(s) as well. Neither the recipient nor the sender is then able to see the message. Once the message is deleted, the action cannot be undone. Any information the sender submits through messaging, however, may be passed along by the recipient without the sender’s knowledge. This may occur by forwarding the notification email or text, or capturing and forwarding a screenshot of the message(s) prior to deletion.
Hudl supports the privacy and competitiveness of teams by requiring authentication to view the messages and files shared within Hudl Messaging. Hudl reserves the right, but is not obligated to, disclose any information if, in its sole opinion, Hudl suspects or has reason to suspect that the information involves a party who may be the victim of harassment in any form. Information may be disclosed to authorities that Hudl, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate to handle such disclosure. Appropriate authorities may include, without limitation, law enforcement agencies, child protection agencies, or court officials. Additionally, Hudl reserves the right to divulge the contents of a communication to an addressee or intended recipient of such communication. Given this, even if both the sender and recipient(s) deleted their message(s), conversation(s) directed at either party may be provided to the individual at either party’s request.
We may also use aggregated Messaging information for purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Hudl’s products, services, and customer communications. Hudl will not share with any partners any information provided via Messaging, except on aggregate, unless explicitly approved by the team admin.
We reserve the right to access Messaging information when necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, including suspected fraud, harassment, and threats to the safety of any person, as well as violations of our Hudl Site Terms or Acceptable Use Policy, or as otherwise required by law.
14. Retention of Personal Information
We keep personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it as set out in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless longer retention is required by applicable law. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing our products and services, and enhancing their safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defense of legal claims. We will not retain any of your personal information beyond this period and the retention of your personal information will be subject to periodic review.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information; the purposes for which we use the personal information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable laws that require us to retain information for regulatory purposes or permit us to retain the information to preserve our legal rights.
We may keep an anonymized form of your personal information, which will no longer refer to you, for statistical purposes without time limits, to the extent that we have a legitimate and lawful interest in doing so.
15. Confidentiality and Security
Hudl is committed to seeking to safeguard all personal information that you provide to us; seeking to ensure that it remains confidential and secure; and taking all reasonable steps to ensure that personal privacy is respected. All our data is stored in written or electronic form on our servers and computers and in various physical locations. We maintain reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, and loss or corruption by computer viruses and other sources of harm. We limit access to personal information to those staff members, joint venture partners, subsidiary companies and third parties who need to know that information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
16. Compliance with Privacy Laws
Hudl complies with the data protection and privacy laws to which it is subject. You should satisfy yourself that you are familiar with those laws, including any exceptions which may apply under them. You should also be aware that privacy laws in various jurisdictions may change from time to time. Except to the extent expressly stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, Hudl accepts no obligations with respect to the handling of personal information other than those mandated by law in the country which has or countries which have jurisdiction over Hudl in any given circumstances.
17. Grounds for Processing in the UK/EEA
If you are in the United Kingdom and/or European Economic Area, to process your data lawfully we need to rely on one or more valid legal grounds. The grounds we may rely upon include: (1) your consent to particular processing activities. For example, where you have consented to us using your information for marketing purposes; (2) our legitimate interests as a business (except where your interests or fundamental rights override these). For example, it is within our legitimate interests to use your data to send you our electronic newsletter and product updates if you represent a corporate entity (unless you have unsubscribed); (3) our compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject. For example, we have a duty to investigate and respond to complaints made against us and may need to process your personal information as part of such investigation; or (4) if you are a customer, or are representing a customer, because processing your personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract.
18. Your European Data Protection Rights
Please contact us at
support@hudl.com
cc:
legal@hudl.com
any time to exercise any of your data protection rights. Data protection law applicable to individuals in Europe provides individuals with certain rights, including the right to access, rectify, withdraw consent, erase, restrict, transport, and object to the processing of their personal information. Individuals also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant information protection authority if they believe that their personal information is not being processed in accordance with the law. Further information about your rights is set out below:
Right to obtain a copy of your personal information.
You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
Right to rectification.
You may request that we rectify any inaccurate and/or complete any incomplete personal information. If we disagree and believe the information to be accurate and complete, we will advise you and include a notation on the record that you dispute the information’s accuracy. We will respond to your request to correct or supplement your personal information within a reasonable time period and, in any event, within any time period specified in relevant laws.
Right to withdraw consent
. You may, as permitted by law, withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time. Such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your previous consent. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, you may not be able to benefit from certain service features for which the processing of your personal information is essential.
Right to object to processing.
You may, as permitted by law, request that we stop processing your personal information. You also have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
Right to erasure.
You may request that we erase your personal information and we will comply, unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so.
Your right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority
. We suggest that you contact us about any questions or if you have a complaint in relation to how we process your personal information. However, you do have the right to contact the relevant supervisory authority in the relevant country directly. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office at
https://ico.org.uk
.
19. International Transfer of Personal Data
Individuals in the European Union and the UK should be aware that Hudl may transfer your personal data to a third party in countries outside the EU or the UK for further processing in accordance with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. In particular, your personal data may be transferred throughout the Hudl group and to our outsourced service providers located abroad. In these circumstances, we will, as required by applicable law, ensure that your privacy rights are adequately protected by appropriate technical, organization, contractual or other lawful means.
All data that Hudl sends out of the EU/EEA/UK is sent to countries with an EU or UK adequacy status, as applicable, or to organisations with signed EU Standard Contract Clauses or UK Standard Contractual Clauses. Hudl transfers data between its group of companies, for which the international transfers of EU/EEA/UK data are detailed within Hudl’s Intra-Group Data Transfer Agreement, which itself includes the required EU Standard Contract Clauses and UK Standard Contractual Clauses.
All Hudl data transfers to the US are TLS encrypted and generally consist of insensitive personal data. Hudl therefore believes the risk of government surveillance to the privacy of transferred personal data to be very low. Additionally, Hudl will only provide personal data to applicable law enforcement authorities when under strict legal compulsion. When permitted by applicable law, law enforcement and exigencies of time, Hudl will notify its customers of any such legal requests involving their personal data.
