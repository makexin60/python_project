C-SPAN'S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY
C-SPAN is sensitive to the privacy concerns of the visitors to all of its websites, newsletters and to users of its apps. The websites, which can be reached through the domain www.c-span.org, are operated by National Cable Satellite Corporation, d/b/a C-SPAN ("NCSC" or "C-SPAN" or "we" or "our" or "us"). This Privacy Policy applies to all of our websites except The C-SPAN Shop website, which collects credit card and other information from users.
This policy applies to all the other C-SPAN websites that can be reached from www.c-span.org. It describes the types of information collected from you, what we do with it, with whom we share it and how you can correct or change such information. This policy does not govern the separate websites, applications, newsletters, social media platforms, and services of any third parties that may link to or be linked to from C-SPAN's websites. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing us any personal data.
Your use of this website and C-SPAN apps signifies your agreement to its terms.
.
Personally Identifying Information:
Personally Identifying Information ("Personal Data") is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual. It includes information such as your name, email address, home address, photograph, and phone number. We do not collect Personal Data from you unless you volunteer it. For example, when you create a MyC-SPAN account you are asked for an email address, a username, and your first and last name. You may also choose to provide a photograph and some background information. If you use the "add to my calendar" feature of MyC-SPAN account, you will make certain program choices linked to you. All of this is Personal Data that we retain.
Our agents and contractors who have access to your Personal Data are required by us to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing on our behalf.
When you verify your cable or satellite subscription to get online access to the live streams of C-SPAN, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 you are also providing Personal Data to your cable company, satellite company or other distributor. Your distributor may use your Personal Data for its own purposes as described in its privacy policy.
Our Use of Your Personal Data:
We will use your Personal Data for the purposes for which it was provided. For example, if you provide Personal Data to create a MyC-SPAN account, we will use it to provide you with that service. We will not use your Personal Data for any other purpose. We will not give it to any of our affiliates. We will retain it indefinitely. However, if you choose to delete your MyC-SPAN account, we will delete your Personal Data from our records.
Correction and Deletion:
If you would like to review, correct or change the Personal Data that you provided us when you created a MyC-SPAN account, you may do so by going to the Edit Your MyC-SPAN Profile page and click on "edit my account." If you would like to delete your account, you can do so on the same page by clicking the Delete My Account button.
Data Use for Advertising:
Data Use for Advertising: C-SPAN incorporates third-party services to display advertisements on webpages, app screens, audio, podcasts and video. We do this to help fund our operations. Google and other supply-side platforms collect data about you and sell that data to demand-side platforms in order for them to serve interest-based ads to you via our digital properties. The information collected and used may include your browsing history and network connection type as well as information about your computer or device, such as the type and model, operating system, manufacturer, IP address, carrier name, location, browser, and identifiers assigned to your device. Google and other parties use cookies, web beacons or pixels, mobile ad identifiers, and other data to serve ads and they may sell the data to other parties in the process. More detailed information about how Google collects and uses this data, including the ability for you to opt-out of personalized advertising, is available at this link:
How Google Uses Data
. Additionally, based on your location, some users will see a link that offers privacy settings including the ability to opt out of the sale of data about you. Please note that opting out through the link may not mean you will stop seeing interest-based ads based on personal information sold before you exercised your right to opt out.
MyC-SPAN Accounts:
'Public' or 'Private':
You have the option to create a MyC-SPAN account that is either 'public' or 'private.' If your account is 'public' your username (and photograph, if you provide one) may be listed on other website pages along with your video clip choices. If your account is 'private' only your video clip choices will appear without any connection to you personally. If you do not select either 'public' or 'private' in setting up your account, it will be 'private.'
Aggregated Anonymous Data:
We may also use Personal Data in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis. In order to better understand and serve users we may conduct research on user demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data we gather. Although this aggregated data may be based in part on Personal Data, it does not identify you personally. We may also use aggregated data collected from the website for website administration, promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. For example, IP addresses are used for system administration and to provide aggregated data to third parties about the volume of use on the website.
Aggregated and Anonymous Information and "Cookies":
We may use "cookies" and similar tools to relate your use of c-span.org and aggregated data to your Personal Data. If any aggregated data is linked with Personal Data, the linked aggregated data will then be treated as Personal Data. A cookie is a small data file written to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit our website. Cookies allow us to measure traffic activity and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your password or enabling us to send you weekly C-SPAN Alerts. Regardless, no information gathered through the use of cookies will be shared with any unaffiliated third parties. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent, but it is possible that some parts of the website will not function properly if you do so.
C-SPAN Apps
If you download a C-SPAN app, you will be asked if you want to receive push notifications from us. If you choose to receive them you will occasionally receive alerts informing you of programs that you may be interested in. The CSPAN apps incorporate third-party software, and may collect information about your personal device, including its advertising identifier (which is Personal Data) or anonymized data for analytics purposes. The software providers are neither contractors nor agents of C-SPAN.
C-SPAN Content on Third-Party Apps
You may be able to access C-SPAN's content on third-party digital properties.  Contact information such as authentication information, account legitimacy, search requests, log events and device identifiers such as IP addresses, device IDs or other unique identifiers may be needed while utilizing such platforms. Since we do not control third-party digital properties and are not responsible for any information you may provide while on such platforms, we encourage you to read the privacy policies on those digital properties or devices before providing any of your information.
Donations:
As with other 501(c)3 non-profit organizations, C-SPAN tracks donation activity on an individual basis. If you choose to donate to C-SPAN through our websites, or express interest in or request information about making donations, we may keep a record that includes your name and contact information.
Disclosure to Others:
We may disclose Personal Data without providing you with a choice under the following limited circumstances to: (1) protect the legal rights, privacy or safety of NCSC or its subsidiaries, affiliates or its or their employees, agents and contractors; (2) protect the safety and security of visitors to our websites or other properties; (3) protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes; (4) respond to inquiries or requests from public authorities; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; (6) or comply with the law or legal process.
This Policy Statement is made in the name of National Cable Satellite Corporation and is effective as of March 24, 2023 and will not be changed without notifying users by means of a revised statement at this website. This statement does not create an agreement between the NCSC and users and, as such, does not create any legal rights for any party. NCSC is the non-profit and tax-exempt educational corporation that owns and operates C-SPAN, C-SPAN2, C-SPAN3, WCSP-FM, C SPAN.org and related websites, and C-SPAN apps. The c-span.org website is operated in and controlled from the United States of America.
