As a central repository for existing, new and revised policies and guidelines, the SVA Policy Database serves to standardize policy format, eliminate redundancies, improve the organization, accessibility, search and navigation functions.
The policies are organized in categories as noted in the menus below. Some policies may be listed in multiple categories. University policies, procedures, and guidelines are retained and maintained in this database to guide and inform the University community, including faculty, staff, administration, and students.
