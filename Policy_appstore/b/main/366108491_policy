Agreement to Deal Electronically; Electronic Communications and Notices.
All of your transactions with or through the Site may, at our option, be conducted electronically from start to finish. If we decide to proceed non-electronically, those services will still be governed by the remainder of these Terms unless you enter into different terms on a form provided by us. If the law allows you to withdraw this consent or if we are ever required to deal with you non-electronically, we reserve the right to charge or increase fees and you agree to print or make an electronic copy of the Terms and any other contract or disclosure that we are required to provide to you.
Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, we will give you any notices regarding the Site by posting them on the Site. You also authorize INFINITE SOLUTIONS to send notices (including notice of subpoenas or other legal process, if any) via electronic mail. You must check the Site for notices, and you will be considered to have received a notice when it is posted on the Site, or when sent by us via electronic mail, whether or not received by you. You must keep your address current and any notice sent by us to an email address that you have provided to us will be considered effective notice.

You agree that you are solely responsible for all transactions or acts that are validated through use of your account, whether or not made with your knowledge or authority. You agree to guard your account carefully, with the full awareness that a failure to keep it secure will enable others to engage in transactions through the Site for which you will be legally responsible. If you ever suspect that someone may have obtained access to your account who is not intended to have authority to act on your behalf, please contact INFINITE SOLUTIONS immediately. You authorize INFINITE SOLUTIONS to refuse to accept any further orders placed under that account on your behalf-and INFINITE SOLUTIONS will use commercially reasonable efforts to block such orders.

Submission of Comments; Prohibited Content and Conduct.
Any comments or information that you provide to INFINITE SOLUTIONS, for example, feedback or ideas in response to a customer survey regarding the Site, product or content reviews, suggestions, ideas, concepts, or other information are collectively deemed "Submissions". None of the Submissions will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of INFINITE SOLUTIONS, and INFINITE SOLUTIONS will not be liable for any use or disclosure (including publication in any medium) of any Submissions. You hereby grant INFINITE SOLUTIONS a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide license to use, copy, reproduce, create derivative works from, adapt, modify, publish, edit, translate, sell, distribute, transmit, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, and display the Submissions without any limitation and in any media or any form now known or later developed. Without limiting the foregoing, INFINITE SOLUTIONS will be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions. Further, INFINITE SOLUTIONS may sublicense these rights to third parties.
Under no circumstance is INFINITE SOLUTIONS responsible for any Submission to the Site or for the content of that Submission, nor shall INFINITE SOLUTIONS be held liable for any of the claims made therein. We are not responsible for the content or accuracy of any of these Submissions, and the views and opinions they express are solely those of the original contributor.
Moderation & Posting Rules:
All blog posts and blog private messages must be in English. No other languages are permitted.
Although messages posted are not the responsibility of INFINITE SOLUTIONS and we are not responsible for the content or accuracy of any of these messages, we reserve the right for ourselves and our agents to edit or delete any message for any or no reason whatsoever. Generally we only moderate reviews, messages, Submissions, or posts that are in breach of our rules or policies or threads that have not been accessed for some time. If you do find any reviews, messages, Submissions, or posts are objectionable then please contact us with a link to the item in question. We are particularly concerned with hate language and we will not hesitate to ban frequent or extreme offenders breaching any of our rules or policies.
You must only post in the relevant blog or area on the Site and should not take a thread off topic. You can start a new thread and link any side issues as needed. You agree not to spam on the Site or harvest contact information for commercial gain. Posts should only be made once and in one area only. You may not cross post. A moderator may link a thread to several forums if necessary rather than cross posting in multiple places. Posts may only be bumped if they are beneath closed posts. Junk posts such as random characters, irrelevant garbage or a short message that adds nothing new to a thread (such as just 'LOL') are prohibited. Basically, don't spam or flood please. Thanks!
You agree to refrain from swearing, profanity, foul language, discourteous behavior, racial, national or sexual slurs or other inappropriate or illegal behavior on the Site. No warez links or crack how-tos or posts of a pornographic or sexual nature please. No links to inappropriate content please. This is a family friendly Site.
You agree not to use the Site to post any material which is illegal or that may generally be deemed to be vulgar, defamatory, inaccurate, harassing, hateful, threatening, invading of others privacy, sexually oriented or violates any laws. Our reference to swearing includes acronyms and variations and misspellings. We understand that sometimes posters will wish to vehemently disagree with someone else's post. This is fine but personal attacks or responses resorting to vulgar language are not permitted. Should a moderator or Site administrator intercede in a thread due to it getting out of hand, he she may optionally close the thread (temporarily until people cool down or permanently) or request that members make no more than one more post on the subject (closing arguments.) You may not continue such "flame" topics by starting a new thread or post more than the one time as directed but you may edit your existing posts as desired should you have the ability to do so.
Prohibited Content:
You must not post to the Site or provide any Submissions that, as reasonably determined by us, is or appears to be the following:
o untrue, misleading, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive to another person's privacy or protected data, hateful, or racially or otherwise objectionable;
o infringing upon a third party's intellectual property rights, including any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, including any content that is the subject of any claim of infringement;
o of a type that you do not have a right to transmit under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships, such as proprietary and confidential information;

o in violation of any applicable local, state, national or international law (including export laws).
Prohibited Conduct:
You must not do, or attempt to do, any of the following, as reasonably determined by us, subject to applicable law:
o access or use the Site in any way that is not in compliance with any applicable local, state, national or international law (including export laws), contracts, intellectual property rights or constitutes the commission of a tort, or for any purpose that is harmful or unintended (by us), or other than in full compliance with these Terms;

IF YOU SEND UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL EMAIL OR ADVERTISING, BULK EMAIL, SPAM, OR CHAIN LETTERS (COLLECTIVELY, "UNSOLICITED EMAIL OR OTHER COMMUNICATION") THROUGH THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL HAVE CAUSED SUBSTANTIAL HARM TO THE SITE, BUT THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE HARM WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.
