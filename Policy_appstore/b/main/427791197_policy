2. Who is the data controller?
Where the terms "Company", "we", "our" and "data controller" appear in this Policy, they are intended to refer to:
Blue SAS, with registered office at 75, boulevard Haussmann - 75008 Paris, France (R.C.S n° 490 641 354), the data controller for processing the personal data of Users and/or Customers in accordance with this Privacy Policy (hereafter: "Company", "we", "our", "data controller").
3. What are Cookies and other similar technologies?
Cookies are small text files stored on computers, hard drives, smartphones or tablets (hereinafter referred to as the "Device"). Cookies contain a small amount of user-specific data and allow a server to offer a personalised page on the User's Device.
We may also use similar technologies on our Properties called "tags" (such as "tracking pixels" or "scripts"), "HTML5 local storage", "Web beacon" or "plug-ins", as well as "software development kits" (SDKs) and fingerprint recognition techniques, or technologies that allow the User to store or access information on their Device in order to identify the latter to analyse their visits to a Website or App.
These similar technologies can also be used together with Cookies to allow the storage of information about the Device used to access our Properties, or to allow its transmission to and from it.
In addition, by implementing Cookies and other similar technologies described above, if the User returns to our Properties, the latter will be able to read and recognise these technologies, that are mainly used for the operation of our Website or to improve the operation of the same or the App, as well as to provide commercial and marketing information to the owner of the Website.
4. Authorisation for the use of Cookies on our Website or on the App
In accordance with the note on the use of Cookies on the homepage of our Website (or before using the Apps for the first time) and in our Cookies Policy by clicking on the "Accept everything and continue to the site" ("Accept") button on the Cookie banner, you consent to the use of Cookies described here, unless you have set the preferences in the "Privacy Settings" area or have changed your browser settings to disable their use.
5. What categories of data do we collect and use?
When you visit the Website and use the comparison service or access the Apps (as a "User"), the following categories of data are collected:
We collect information about your visits to the Website and your use of the Website, such as the Device and browser you are using, the IP address or domain names of any computers connected to the Website, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of any request made, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system and the computer environment used, the date and time of the visit, the duration of the visit, the referral site and the navigation path to the Website leading to the visit and interactions on the Website itself, including the services and offers you, the User, are interested in. Note that we may link this information to your User account, if it exists.
Location data: subject to the specific authorisation that the User gives the operating system of their device, we may access, via API call, the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) provided by the device’s GPS. The methods of processing personal data carried out by the device’s operating system can be consulted in the device’s settings. If the User wishes to revoke the authorisation or modify the information that their device’s operating system is authorised to share with our App, they must access the device’s Settings. We use the location data solely to retrieve the closest airports and suggest the nearest solutions to the user during the departure location selection. Geographical coordinates are discarded immediately after being used to retrieve this information. However, the API call to the device’s GPS is logged in our access logs with a retention period of 15 days.
See the following section of this Policy for more information on the purposes for which we collect and use this information.
6. Types of Cookies used on our Website
6.1 Types of Cookies according to the management entity
Based on the entity that manages the Website or the domain from which Cookies are set and processed, the following types of Cookies exist:
Proprietary Cookies:

6.2 Types of Cookies according to the length of time you stay connected:
Depending on how long you remain active on your Device, there are the following types of Cookies:

The Cookie remains on the hard drive until it reaches its expiration date. The maximum time for which we use Persistent Cookies on our Website is 1 year. Afterwards, your browser will delete the Cookie from your hard drive.
6.3 Types of Cookies and other similar technologies according to their purpose
Cookies and other similar technologies (collectively "Cookies") can be grouped as follows:
Cookies with necessary functions:
Technical Cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our Website or our App and are essential for browsing, as well as for the use of various features. For example, without them, you can't use search and comparison tools, keep your currency preferences, or log in and use your personal account.
We also use these Cookies to measure traffic statistics and the performance of different versions of the same site (commonly called "A/B tests") to detect navigation problems and organise content, as well as for security reasons.
Personalisation, advertising and remarketing Cookies:
these Cookies are used to collect and process information related to the use of our services and/or our content by the User, as well as the measurement of delivery and interaction with advertising, for example, by clicking on an advertisement, to create a profile of the User and their interests, to show the aforementioned User personalised ads and/or content  relevant to them on our Properties or on our advertisements on other Websites or Apps. Generally, the content of the Website or App is used to process or infer the interests of the User in order to determine the selection of future ads and content. To this end, we may also use the services provided by third parties on our behalf to collect data and/or offer advertisements during the User's visits to our Properties or on our advertisements on other Websites or Apps, in order to show you advertisements relating to goods and services that interest you.
Selection, delivery and reporting of third-party ads:
this purpose is linked to the collection and processing of information by third parties who place Cookies and other tracking technologies on our Properties and the combination with previously collected information, to select and provide personalised advertisements for the User and to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such advertisements. This includes the use of previously collected information about the User's interests in order to select ads, process data about which ads were shown, how often they were shown, when and where they were shown and whether the User has taken any action related to the ad, including, for example, clicking on an ad. This could include personalisation, i.e., the collection and processing of information related to the User's interests to personalise, at a later date, advertisements and/or content for the User in other contexts, such as on other Websites or Apps. However, these companies use information that is not directly identified (which does not include, by way of example, the User's name, address, email address or phone number).
These Cookies are "Third-Party Cookies" that are not managed by us and, due to their operation, are not accessible by us. We are also not responsible for their management and their purpose. Article 7 of this Cookies Policy contains more information on the profile of the aforementioned third parties, on the purposes of their processing and on the opt-out mechanism.
Transfer of data to third countries:
Transfer of data to third countries: the User explicitly consents to the transfer of data to countries that do not guarantee an adequate level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, including countries that are not affected by an adequacy decision and where certain national programmes outside the European Union can guarantee public authorities access to the User's personal data. For this purpose, further information on the transfer of data to third countries not covered by an adequacy decision can be found here.
Purpose of the transfer:
Third parties based in third countries may collect personal data through cookies or other tracking technologies when the User visits our Website and accepts the use of the following categories of Cookies: Cookies to improve the User experience and Cookies to personalise ads.
Type of data transferred:
we collect information about your visits to the Website and your use of the Website and/or our services, such as the Device and browser you are using, the IP address or domain names of any computers connected to the Website, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of any request made, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system and the computer environment used, the date and time of the visit, the duration of the visit, the referral site and the navigation path to the Website leading to the visit and interactions on the Website itself, including the services and offers you, the User, are interested in.
Identity or categories of recipients:
data can be transferred to Ad-tech providers and other actors who place their Cookies or other technologies in our Properties, based in third countries and operating in the supply of targeted advertising. Article 7 of this Cookies Policy contains a list of these actors.
Transfer risk:
with reference to the transfer of data to the USA, the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-311/18 of 16/7/2020 (Data Protection Commissioner/Facebook Ireland Ltd. and Maximillian Schrems) annulled the EU-USA Privacy Shield. In particular, the Court of Justice of the European Union has highlighted that the requirements of US domestic law, and in particular certain programmes that, for national security reasons, allow US public authorities to access personal data transferred from the EU to the United States, involve limitations in the protection of personal data that are not limited. In this sense, they do not meet the requirements substantially equivalent to those provided for by European law and, moreover, this legislation does not grant the interested parties rights that can be prosecuted in court against the US authorities. Legal basis of the transfer: the explicit consent of the User, if granted (Article 49 of the GDPR, paragraph 1, letter A).
Legal basis for the transfer:
explicit consent of the User, if provided.
