Alarm.com's Privacy Policy (United States)
Our Privacy Mission
Alarm.com Incorporated (
"Alarm.com," "we,"
or
"us"
) cares about the privacy of the information we collect about you.  This Privacy Policy explains how and when we collect, use, protect, and share your personal information and the rights and choices you can exercise in relation to your personal information.
1. Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you if you reside in the United States or its territories. If you are a resident of a country other than the United States, you can
click here
to access the Alarm.com privacy policy specific to your country. Please note that your use of this Alarm.com website (
"Website"
), wherever you reside, is subject to our
Website Terms and Conditions.
Alarm.com collects and stores certain information from or about you that can be used to uniquely contact, identify, or locate you (
"Personal Information"
). We collect Personal Information through your use of (i) Alarm.com’s websites or mobile applications, including this Website and the Alarm.com mobile application (collectively, the
"User Interfaces"
), and (ii) any combination of products and services either provided to you or accessed via any User Interface (collectively, the
"Services"
).
End-Users of the Services
The Services are provided by licensed and authorized service providers (referred to as
"Authorized Service Providers"
) which independently sell and provide the Services to their customers (
"End-Users"
). If you are an End-User, then Alarm.com acts as a data processor and collects your Personal Information on behalf of your Authorized Service Provider when you use the Services, log into your account through the User Interfaces, or otherwise provide Personal Information to us regarding your account. You should also refer to your Authorized Service Provider’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
Website Visitors and Other Individuals
If you are (i) not an existing End-User of the Services or are not logged into your account and use one of our User Interfaces (a
"Visitor"
) or (ii) providing Personal Information to us through the User Interfaces, email or phone, then Alarm.com processes your Personal Information while acting as a data controller.
2. When We Collect Personal Information
When You Provide Personal Information Directly to Us
When you (i) use the User Interfaces or the Services as a Visitor or End-User, (ii) participate in our marketing campaigns (including contests, promotions, or other activities), (iii) contact us for support, or (iv) otherwise communicate with us (including by phone, email, text, or online live chat), you may directly provide us with Personal Information.
When Your Authorized Service Provider Provides Personal Information Directly to Us
When you are an End-User of the Services, your Authorized Service Provider may directly provide us with Personal Information about your account, such as its features, settings and devices, in order to personalize and customize the Services for you.
When Personal Information is Collected Through Your Use of the User Interfaces or Services
When you use the User Interfaces or Services, Personal Information may be collected by automated means, such as through cookies and analytics on the User Interfaces. It may also be created and collected through your use of the Services, such as event history, device usage and saved video clips. We receive this Personal Information from the devices on your account, such as security sensors, thermostats and video cameras, and your computer, mobile phone or other electronic devices through which you may access, browse, download, receive, or otherwise use the Alarm.com User Interfaces or Services (each a
"Personal Device"
). We may also receive and process such Personal Information from third parties.
3. Types of Personal Information We Collect
Identifiers
When you use the User Interfaces or Services as a visitor or End-User, we may collect the following from you or other users on your account: name, home or business address, phone number, email address, home or business size, zip code, device names, and other identifying account or user information.
Account and Device Information
When you use the User Interfaces or Services as an End-User, we may collect the following from you or other users on your account:  account creation date, home or business system configuration, features enabled, service packages, IP addresses, device IDs, account and device settings, modes, automation settings, and device usage and performance (electrical usage or consumption, heating and cooling information, light or other fixture settings, and usage and alert logs).
Location-based Information
Some features of our Services, such as location-activated arming reminders, thermostat adjustments, and other location-based Services through your Personal Devices (collectively, "
GeoServices
"), use location information.  When you subscribe to the GeoServices and enable location-based features, we will automatically collect and store location information provided by your Personal Devices, such as mobile phones, GPS devices, or connected vehicle devices. This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited.
Video and Audio
When you (i) subscribe to Alarm.com’s video Services, (ii) use a Personal Device that is capable of recording video and/or audio (such as a video doorbell or camera), or (iii) subscribe to emergency two-way voice services, you are enabling us, certain of our third-party service providers, our affiliates and subsidiaries, or your central station, to record, store, view and process video and/or audio live streams and saved recordings from your Personal Devices. This may include capturing and sending you portions of video or audio recordings as part of a notification or analyzing the video or audio live streams or recordings to identify motion, send you alerts, or trigger alarm or other events. In addition, if you have the recording features enabled, we will capture, process and store video and audio data recordings from your device and you may be able to access those recordings.
Data protection and privacy laws may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of cameras and other devices with audio and video recording capabilities. You, not Alarm.com, are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home or business that they may be recorded using cameras and other devices with audio and video recording capabilities. Alarm.com takes no responsibility for your compliance with these laws.
Biometric Information
In certain circumstances, our Services may include video cameras or other cameras capable of collecting  the facial geometry or measurements ("
Biometric Information
") of individuals captured in the camera’s field of view. We collect Biometric Information when an End-User (i) enables a feature that includes facial recognition or (ii) otherwise consents to the collection of biometric information. We may also collect Biometric Information from video cameras deployed in certain commercial business settings.  Any Biometric Information we collect is used solely to provide the Services for which such information was collected or to develop and improve our Services or the services of our affiliates and subsidiaries.  We do not sell Biometric Information to third parties.
Connected Vehicle Services Information
When you (i) subscribe to Alarm.com’s connected vehicle Services, such as Connected Car and Connected Fleet, and (ii) enable a Connected Car device by plugging the device into a vehicle, we may collect information about how a connected vehicle is performing, how it is driven, and where it is located.  This may include capturing the following categories of Personal Information from or about a connected vehicle:
Driver behavior information such as braking habits, seatbelt use and vehicle speed.
Vehicle information such as VIN, battery life, and whether your Connected Car device is plugged in.
Geolocation information (including the precise geolocation of the vehicle).
Any information you choose to provide such as driver’s license information or specific information about the vehicle.
Telephone Conversations and Calls
Calls to and from our customer service and support lines may be recorded and monitored, including by our employees, vendors, and artificial intelligence and similar technologies. In addition, we use a suite of technology solutions to assist with and to analyze telephone calls made to us and online chats.  These solutions may record callers’ voices and conversations, transcribe telephone conversations, use artificial intelligence to identify, authenticate and assist callers, and/or evaluate and make recommendations.  Many of these technology solutions and applications include software and related technology from vendors or other third parties, and we may share the data collected during calls and communications with these third-party entities.  By using our services, including telephone and website communications, you accept and consent to our collection of such data (including personal data) and to our sharing that data with others.
Other Information Collected via Chatbots
We use chatbots powered by third-party providers on our User Interfaces to provide you with information and support. When you interact with a chatbot on the User Interfaces, all the information you choose to provide to the chatbot may be collected and associated with your name or your IP address and a transcript of your interactions or communications with or through the chatbot may be created and stored.  You should not enter any information into the chatbot that you would not want saved, recorded, or monitored.  By using or interacting with a chatbot on our User Interfaces, you understand that you are communicating with automated self-service software provided by one of our third-party providers or communicating with our representative through one of our third-party providers; in either case, your communications may be saved, recorded, or monitored by us or our third-party provider.  You also consent to our and our third-party providers’ collecting, monitoring, recording, and managing any information (including Personal Information) that you enter into the chatbot or generate by using or interacting with the chatbot. We and our third-party providers may also collect, monitor, record and manage certain device and usage information automatically, including information collected in connection with the chatbot via cookies and other tracking technologies.  Our third-party chatbot providers include Salesforce (Privacy Statement:
https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/full_privacy/
) and ZoomInfo (Privacy Policy:
https://www.zoominfo.com/legal/privacy-policy
). For more information about how our third-party providers may collect, use, or disclose your information obtained by using or interacting with the chatbot, please read their privacy policies.
