macOS
By default, Mactracker periodically checks to see if a newer version of the app is available. This request is sent by https (version 7.5.4 and later) and contains the current version and your preferred language. This information is necessary to provide the correct update version. You may turn off this feature from the preferences window. If you downloaded Mactracker from the Mac App Store, this process is managed by the operating system.
iOS/iPadOS and macOS
