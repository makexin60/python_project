This is the Privacy Policy of Unearby, Inc. and SayHi with its plugins or related applications(including SayHi, Video Chat for SayHi and Contacts Finder) and its various & next versions (“SayHi”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our products and services as the “Service.”  Please read on to learn more about our data handling practices. Your use of the Service signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
Information we collect
It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
Information you give us
When you install the Service on your device and register with SayHi, personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process for the Service (as requested from you during the download process) when you register with us.  For registration through SayHi, you are required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, city location, gender, name, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service. You may also provide personally identifiable information, but that is optional.  When you log in using your Facebook account, we may collect additional information you make available to us (see “Your User Profile”) below.

	In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register with SayHi, you may will be asked to allow us access to your address book.  If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personal information in your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to help you use the Service.  If you do not want SayHi to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings in the SayHi application at any time. However we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this information.

	SayHi may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information including country of residence and preferences. In addition, SayHi may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the Service, including video chat durations, text messages, usage by geographies, device and connection information, IP address, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our websites.

	SayHi allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the SayHi application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications will be stored on our servers.  In addition, if you choose to share these items with other SayHi users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with.  Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the SayHi application is your decision.  By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). SayHi is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.

	SayHi may also collect and gather user contents (e.g., photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials) that you create on the Service. Your photo can be taken by other users on the SayHi, and If they use capturing function provided by the SayHi, those photos can be stored and used for SayHi and 3rd party’s service(eg, Facebook, etc.). You can change sharing option of 3rd party on the SayHi settings. If you do not agree with all the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.

	We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases. In general these reports do not contain personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. As part of these error reports, we receive information about the type and version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and fixing the error.
In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
Other Users Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.
	Social Media You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your SayHi! account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.
