Publicly Posted Content
Recurrent users may have the ability to post content to one or more Recurrent forums or webpages, such as user-submitted pages, chat rooms, and bulletin boards. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. Please take care when using these features.  You may request and obtain removal of such posted content by contacting us at
compliance@recurrent.io
and specifically identifying the content to be removed.  Please be advised that any such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of all traces of the content posted on the Recurrent forums.
Data Retention
We will retain your personal information only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information; the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.

Data Security
We have implemented and maintained reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply common protections described in this policy.

California
California residents may submit CCPA requests themselves or using an authorized agent using our
Privacy Portal
or by emailing us at
compliance@recurrent.io
. CCPA requests are subject to our verification measures which vary depending on the type of request made and the sensitivity of the information you request. We may ask you to provide a few pieces of information to confirm your identity in our records. If you authorize an agent to submit a request on your behalf, we may require the agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request and may verify the agent’s identity and authority to act on your behalf.
How We Respond To Do-Not-Track Signals & Global Privacy Controls
: A “do-not-track” signal is a privacy preference feature in some web browsers that tells a website that a user does not want their online activity to be tracked. We currently support Global Privacy Control (GPC), a specification designed to allow internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want to be tracked or have their personal information sold or shared with third parties for targeted advertising. It consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that our Websites can use to honor your privacy settings. GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions, click here to view the options. If you want to use GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser extension. More information about downloading GPC can be found by clicking
here
. If your browser or device has enabled GPC, it will override your preferences selected in the cookie banner or privacy settings on this Website.
California Shine the Light Disclosures
: California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors to our Websites and users of our Services who are California residents to request, once a year, certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make a request, please send us an email at
compliance@recurrent.io
and include “Shine the Light Request” in the subject line.
Notice of Financial Incentive
We may offer our customers loyalty and other incentive programs that provide certain benefits, such as rewards and exclusive offers. We may also provide other promotional campaigns, such as sweepstakes, contests, or limited-time promotions (collectively, the “Programs”). When you sign up for one of these Programs, we typically ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and/or telephone number). Because our Programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under the CCPA. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable Program, less the expense related to offering those products, services, and benefits to Program participants. Participation in a Program is governed by the applicable terms and conditions (including the official rules for any sweepstakes or contest or the promotional terms for any short-term promotion), which will also describe the financial incentives associated with the promotion and how to participate. You are not obligated to participate in any contest, sweepstakes, or short-term promotion and may terminate your participation at any time (as described in the survey terms and conditions). You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program terms and conditions.
Nevada
Although we do not “sell” “covered information” of Nevada “consumers” as those terms are defined under Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes, you may contact us by sending an email to
compliance@recurrent.io
and registering your email address so that we can provide you notice in the event we should do so in the future. At that future point, you will then have an opportunity to exercise your opt-out rights under that law subject to our verification. You can contact us via
compliance@recurrent.io
if you need to subsequently update your contact email for such notices. It is your responsibility to keep your Nevada notice contact information current.
