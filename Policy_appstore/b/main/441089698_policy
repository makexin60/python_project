This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on VT Explorer’s website and our apps for iPhone/iPad and any other devices and platforms.
Information we collect
Technical basics
If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We
never
use notifications for marketing.
If you upload files to VT Explorer, we need to store them until you delete them.
We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in.
Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.
Ads and analytics
VT Explorer’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.
No personal data is used to target VT Explorer’s ads. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.
Information usage
We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.
We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish VT Explorer’s functionality.
We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
Security
We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are hashed, not stored, using industry-standard methods.
California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
Information for European Union Customers
By using VT Explorer and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.
International Transfers of Information
Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.
