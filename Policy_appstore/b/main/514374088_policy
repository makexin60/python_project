This allows us to ensure that you are who you claim to be and that you are old enough to use the Services. As part of this process, we rely on trusted third parties to assist us in confirming the details you have provided.

, you will be required to provide us with a copy of your photographic identification, such as passport, national ID or driver’s licence. We may also ask you to provide us with proof of address, such as a copy of a recent utility bill.
Once you provide your identification documentation, we will perform a combination of automatic system and manual matching against information entered when opening an account and if the match is confirmed, verification is successful. Where we have been unable to successfully match a customer’s details, an account suspension may be applied. The process is overseen by our Customer Experience teams. If you have any queries or concerns about the verification process or an account suspension, please get in touch and one of our advisors will be able to assist.
For UK customers, we may also check your details against publicly available information such as electoral rolls, to confirm the accuracy of the details you have provided, and to ensure that you are old enough to use our Services. If we become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal information via the Websites, we will take action to remove access from compromised accounts.
To help us comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, when you use our Service, depending on which jurisdiction you reside, we may perform an affordability check to establish whether you have any indications of financial vulnerability. This assessment is performed on our behalf by a trusted third-party, TransUnion, and will leave a search footprint which will not negatively impact your TransUnion credit score.

section above. If you opt-out of receiving marketing from us, we will not send you marketing relating to the Flutter Group.
Please note that if you hold separate accounts within the Group, you should consider your marketing preferences for each separately. For example, if you opted out of marketing for any other product within the Flutter Group and not tombola, you will continue to receive marketing communications directly from tombola unless updated.

Personalised Marketing
Social Marketing
We will work with social media companies such as Facebook and Instagram to provide you with information about our Services via their platforms.
If you are opted in to Direct Marketing, we may share limited personal data with the social media companies to enable us to send you information via their platforms, or market to audiences within their platforms who share similar characteristics to you. If you are opted out of Direct Marketing or if you are on an exclusion list, you will not receive targeted marketing from us via these platforms.
Please note that you may still see adverts from us on social media platforms, even if you are opted out of profiling with us. This type of display, non-targeted marketing is not based on any personal data held or controlled by tombola. If you do not wish to see these adverts, you can control this easily by disabling preference-based marketing in the privacy and ad settings on each individual social media platform.
We may also run untargeted Sponsored marketing within Facebook which you have the option to select “Hide all from tombola” or “Hide post” or “Block tombola’s profile” from within the Facebook environment.

Other Marketing & Communication Information
iOS Users
For iOS Users, using versions prior to 14.5 their iOS device is assigned an Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) which enables app owners and advertisers to track campaigns and deliver personalised advertising. If you are an iOS user and have opted into tracking for tombola, your IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) is used to deliver you personalised advertising that is relevant to you (based on information we have about you, including browsing history, transactional information, demographic information and behavioural information, predictive information we create about you in each case in relation to our Services and advertising and information about what other people with similar interests, demographics and
behaviours are looking at) and is used for attribution and analytics purposes to tell us when and how you have interacted with advertisements, including those that have been placed on a third party site or app, and so we can assess the effectiveness of our campaigns.
You can opt-out of this at any time by visiting your mobile settings (by going to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Apple Advertising.) *In earlier versions of iOS and iPadOS, this setting is called "Privacy".
For those iOS users using versions 14.5 and newer, SKAdnetwork has been implemented by Apple so tombola no longer see or own any personal data. Any requirement to opt-out must be undertaken by the user with Apple directly.
Promotional Content and Events
We may publish players aliases and/or chat names, along with any winnings, prizes received and location, on our websites in accordance with our legitimate interests. Similarly, where you attend an event that is organised or sponsored by tombola, we may, at our discretion, use footage recorded at such events as part of future promotional content.
Surveys and polls
If you choose to participate in a survey or poll either direct from us (tombola) or via social media platforms, any personal data you provide may be used for marketing or market research purposes in accordance with our legitimate interests.

3.6.1. Who this section applies to
All customers of tombola.
3.6.2. Overview
In order to protect our customers and the wider public from the harms caused by fraud, we employ a range of processes and tools to identify and prevent improper use of our Services.
These systems help us ensure that customers are genuine, haven’t registered more than once, and are not fraudulently trying to access accounts that don’t belong to them.
As detailed in the
Registering & verifying your account
and
Processing your payments
& delivering the Services sections above, when you set up an account with us, make a deposit  or play our games, we carry out identity verification and fraud prevention checks. These checks help us confirm that you are old enough to use our Services and that the details you have provided are genuine.
We may share your personal data with organisations that verify details and transactions and identify potential indicators of illegal activity, which they make available to other organisations using their Services. Where necessary, we share your data with credit reference agencies or fraud prevention agencies, which keep a record of that information and make it available to other organisations for use in credit decisions, identification checks and fraud detection and prevention.
While using our Services, we monitor your activity to validate the authenticity of transactions and to ensure no fraudulent behaviours are occurring on our platform. For example, if a login is detected from a device or location other than that normally used on your account, we may conduct a further review or request further information.
Where a suspected or actual incidence of fraud or account takeover (‘
ATO
’) has been identified or reported to us, we may apply restrictions to your account(s) to prevent further fraudulent activity while we perform further investigations, including, where necessary, escalation to our fraud reporting teams, or we may suspend your account(s) and activity entirely. In such cases, we may request further information from you to validate the activity on your account. We may also use information such as your KYC documentation, device information, information sourced from third parties and publicly available sources to support these investigations.
If you wish to query or challenge a suspension or restriction on your account, please contact our Customer Experience team.
Where appropriate, we will pass information to the police and other law enforcement agencies, debt recovery companies and other similar bodies. This may be at the request of one of these bodies, or proactively.
Our fraud team perform regular reporting and analysis to identify trends in fraud activity on our Services, in order to provide the highest degree of protection to our customers. This helps ensure that our fraud prevention processes are performing as efficiently as possible.

3.7.1. Who this section applied to
All customers of tombola.
3.7.2. Overview
At tombola, our customers are at the heart of everything we do. We specifically design our products and Services with this in mind to facilitate a great customer experience, whilst also ensuring customers are protected.
While using our Services, you may be asked for additional information about yourself or the source of your account funding from our Safe Play team. This process assists us to ensure that we can get to know you and provide you with a safe customer experience, as well as helping us fulfil our licencing requirements.
Customer Monitoring and Interaction
As part of our Safe Play framework, we proactively monitor your activity on our sites in real time and retrospectively so as to identify potentially harmful play, and where necessary, take actions to ensure your safety onsite.
We use a combination of machine learning, automated detection systems and manual review to supervise customer activity for the purpose of identifying Safe Play risks, and we also have a dedicated team in Customer Experience to deal with any Safe Play concerns that may be flagged to us by you or other individuals connected to you, such as family or friends. Where potentially dangerous activities are flagged, we may take action. This can range from emailing or calling you to ensure you are comfortable with your level of spend to proactively closing your account for a period of time and opting you out of direct marketing. Where we are unable to interact with you, we may need to take enforced action until such a point where we can communicate with you.
As part of these processes, we will use a range of data points taken from your behaviour and attributes to identify potentially problematic activity. We use elements of profiling and automated analysis techniques to identify such activity and to apply account limitations as and where appropriate. This is in accordance with our licensing requirements to conduct pro-active engagements to prevent gambling harm.
You can get in touch with our Customer Experience team at any stage if you have concerns about your gambling, concerns about another customer’s gambling or if you wish to challenge any restrictions that have been placed on your account, including those that may have been applied as a result of our automated Safe Play processes. All Safe Play related matters are dealt with by a dedicated Safe Play team with our Customer Experience units. Please see the
Contacting Customer Experience
section above for information on how we use your data in this regard.
Vulnerability
If any specific vulnerabilities are identified throughout our standard interaction process, we may take extra steps to enhance protection for our customers by applying restrictions to your tombola account.
Any vulnerability assessment will be subject to customer’s consent where we will ask the appropriate questions necessary to understand any vulnerabilities and impacts. Specific tools may then be recommended to help customers manage their accounts.
Customers will be clearly and specifically informed of the process and will have the choice to provide freely given consent. Customers may also withdraw any given consent at any time. If consent is obtained, the personal data will only be retained for as long as is necessary to meet our legal, regulatory or legitimate business requirements, or until such time as you withdraw your consent.
Customers are also free to withhold consent, at which point the assessment will not go ahead. However, in the event that specific vulnerabilities may fall under a wider scope within Safe Play concerns, the business may restrict your account.
Requesting Supporting Information
We may ask for supporting evidence where a request is made to challenge ‘Spend Limits’ (limits applied by us to cap the maximum spend on some accounts for certain customers), ‘Operator Net Deposit Limit (limits placed by us to cap the maximum amount that can be spent on a customers account) and as part of our standard ‘Enhanced Due Diligence’ (‘
EDD
’) processes.
Documents that may be requested include, but are not limited to; proof of identity, proof of earnings, bank statements and evidence of business ownership. If you are unable to provide any of these documents then we may suspend or restrict your account until you provide the requested information.
We may also ask for supporting documentation in relation to vulnerability assessments including but not limited to evidence of lasting and enduring power of attorney forms.
Exclusions
tombola offers you the facility to ‘Self-Exclude’ from us as part of our Safe Play control tools. This feature allows you to block yourself from all of our Services for varying periods of time depending on your needs.
In certain circumstances, our staff may also make the decision to pro-actively suspend or remove you from our Services, in order to ensure your safety.
Where you apply a Self-Exclusion with tombola or where we decide to exclude you from our Services for Safe Play reasons, we will also share your exclusion information with the other Flutter Group brands that operate in the UK - Paddy Power, Betfair, PokerStars and Sky Betting & Gaming.This action is performed by automatically checking whether accounts with your registered details are held on these other brands, and, where accounts are identified, they will be proactively closed. Such processing will always be performed with the highest regard to the privacy and security of your data, and you have the right to challenge if you wish to dispute the match. For further information, please visit our
Safe Play Hub
or
our
FAQs
on the Self-Exclusion matching process between the Flutter brands.
NB
: Please note that in circumstances where you apply a permanent Self-Exclusion, your information will be retained indefinitely, in order to prevent you from accessing the Services.
Gambling Self Exclusion Schemes
Upon registration, login and at regular intervals we perform checks against relevant gambling commission and self exclusion databases depending on which country you are registered with tombola from.  Where a customer self-excludes via one of these methods, our checks will pick this up and we use this to ensure their wish to self-exclude is applied across our sites and apps.  To find out more please refer to the relevant sites via the links below.   We may in future subscribe to similar national self-exclusion schemes in any of the countries in which we operate, and we will update this notice to let you know.

3.8.1 Who this section applied to
All customers of tombola.
3.8.2. Overview
In order to provide the Services to you and for our legitimate purposes, we process your personal data to evaluate our commercial performance and manage risks to our business.
We carry out basic analytics to help us understand, how, when, where and why our customers use our Services, and how our business is performing for example the effectiveness of our advertising  It also gives us a much clearer picture of our customers generally, the broad demographic groups they fit into (e.g. age group, gender, location, etc.) and the products and Services they use, which in turn helps us to develop better and more relevant features, products and Services.  Where possible we perform analysis in a way that does not identify individual customers, so there is minimal impact on the privacy of any one person.
Most people use our products and Services fairly, but we carry out monitoring and basic analytics of how our customers place stakes, play and interact with our products and Services, to identify behaviour that is not in line with our
Terms & Conditions
or that could be prejudicial to our commercial interests.
At our discretion, we have the right to use this information in making decisions about whether to place restrictions on people’s accounts or to close their accounts. We take this very seriously, and consider a wide variety of factors in making such a decision, taking into account the information we hold about you as well as any information obtained from industry databases. The processes may involve an element of profiling, upon which decisions to restrict or close an account may be made. These decisions are made in accordance with our terms and conditions. If you wish to query or challenge any restriction, decisions are always made with human intervention; the process is never wholly automated.

3.8.4 Who we share your personal data with
Limited data is shared with other companies within the Flutter Group for risk management support purposes. However, this data is pseudonymised by tombola, meaning the other members of the Flutter Group cannot identify you from the data.
3.9.1. Who this section applies to
All customers of tombola.
3.9.2. Overview
As a betting and gaming company we have certain legal obligations we need to abide by. One of those rules is that we must do everything we can to prevent money laundering. At tombola, we will use your personal data to ensure the proceeds of crime are not being used on our Platform, and to identify and tackle such behaviours.
As outlined in the
Registering & verifying your account
section above, where you initially register an account with us, we are required to gather certain information about you in order to verify your identity, as part of our EDD requirements.  For this purpose you may be required to submit documentation establishing your identity and address, and where required, any other information as may be deemed necessary to confirm your identity.
tombola adopts a risk-based approach to compliance with its Anti-Money Laundering obligations, and, depending on your personal characteristics and activity levels, we may be required to gather further information on you, in order to meet requirements under applicable legislation. This is known as ‘Enhanced Due Diligence’ (‘
EDD
’), and as part of this process, we may collect and store financial information in relation to you, as well as information gathered from publicly available sources such as the land registry, the register of companies and social media.
In certain circumstances, we may require you to provide additional documents proving your source of wealth including but not limited to proof of earnings, bank statements, payslips and evidence of business ownership. Such processing will always be conducted with due regard to your privacy.
As part of our obligations, we also regularly screen our customer base against databases of publicly available information. This ensures that we are not offering our Services to individuals who have been the subject of sanctions since registration.
Where suspicious activities, behaviours or characteristics are identified, further investigation will be conducted by our Anti-Money Laundering team, and where necessary, actions may be taken in relation to your account. This may result in your account being suspended until such time as further information is provided by you, or your account being permanently closed. We may also be required to inform local law enforcement authorities or government agencies, as mandated by law.
In order to improve the effectiveness of our Anti-Money Laundering controls and processes, we regularly perform reporting and analysis on customer data. This may involve an element of profiling of customer personal data.
We may also share information with the Flutter Group in order to help prevent fraud, money laundering and other criminal activity across our wider group. Where appropriate, such information may be passed to the police and other law enforcement agencies, and other similar bodies directly by the Flutter Group.

3.10.1 Who the section applied to
All visitors to tombola websites, apps or other assets covered by this Notice.
3.10.2. Overview
We use personal data to deliver and suggest tailored content to personalise your experience with our Services. This is processing which is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests in delivering or presenting relevant content to our customers.
Whichever Services you use, wherever and however you interact with us, we want to give you the same great level of service and make it personal to you.  We will tailor your experience, personalising the layout and content of our sites according to what we know about you, your preferences and the way you like to play.  For example, we will present you with features we know you have used or think you are likely to use or show you the type of game content that best suits your style of play.
We also look at aggregated (non-identifiable) data showing how our customers use our products and features and which games they tend to enjoy.  We use this information to suggest games we think you’ll enjoy because they are popular with others who play the same games as you.
We believe this personalised experience makes betting and gaming better and we want to give you the best customer experience we can.  Using your personal data in this way enables us to do that in a way that we believe does not have an impact on your privacy.  If you don’t want your data used in this way your option is to not use our Services and to close your account.
Please note that some aspects of your customer experience are provided via cookies.  If you have provided consent for these cookies, we will personalise certain aspects of our site, such as remembering your username. You can change these preferences at any time via our Cookie Management centre located at the bottom of our websites. For more information visit our

3.11.1. Who the section applied to
All individuals who engage with tombola or use its Services.
3.11.2. Overview
In addition to the purposes described above, there are other circumstances in which we are required to process your personal data, as described below:
Information/Disclosure Requests and Regulatory Submissions
Apart from the functions set out in this Notice, we do not share your personal data with third parties except where we are compelled or permitted by law to do so. These circumstances are rare but may require us to share information in response to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence.
Whenever we share personal data, and whatever the circumstances, we will always do so legally and with due regard to your privacy. If we receive a request from law enforcement or other statutory bodies, we do not disclose personal data without a warrant, court order or other legally valid proof of authority.
Protecting and defending our rights and interests
Where necessary to protect or defend our rights and interests, defend against legal claims, resolve disputes, respond to what we consider to be incorrect or misleading information provided to a media outlet, or enforce our agreements, we reserve the right to share personal data with regulators, external legal advisors, debt recovery and tracing agencies, and media outlets.
Information Security and Loss Prevention
We may be required to use and retain personal data in order to protect our rights, information, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons in accordance with our legitimate interests, or in some instances, with our legal obligations. For example, we are legally obliged under data protection law to secure and protect the personal data of customers, employees and all other individuals whose personal data we use.
Restructuring
If ownership of all or part of our business changes or we undergo a reorganisation or restructure, we will transfer your personal data to the new owner or successor company so we or they can continue to provide the Services you have requested.
Financial Reporting and Analysis
In accordance with our obligations under company law and other similar regulations we are required to keep a record of your transactions in order to maintain proper financial records to meet and to ensure all transactions are being performed in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of our Services.
We utilise data including transaction records, staking and behavioural trends, and financial specifics exclusively for the purpose of accurate financial reporting. These data points enable us to evaluate tombola's financial health, identify trends, and make informed strategic decisions to enhance our operations.
In some instances, we may share anonymized and aggregated data with our parent company (Flutter) and trusted consultants, all operating under stringent confidentiality constraints. This collaborative effort contributes to strategic planning and informed decision-making across the organization. Any shared data will be either stripped of personal identifiers and therefore cannot be linked back to individual users or be pseudonymised.
Chat Rooms, Messaging and Community Forums
A number of our Services provide features including game chat rooms, messaging Services, and community forums for collaboration, peer connection, games, and information exchange purposes. Depending upon the Service, the personal data you choose to post, share, upload, or make available may be public and visible to others who use those Services. You should never post or share any information that is confidential or about others unless you have permission to do so. We may use information you provide in community and event profiles and forums to personalise your experience and to make content and peer connection recommendations. These Services may have their own Terms of Use.

4. GENERAL PROCESSING INFORMATION
This section provides you with some other important information you need to be aware of in relation to how we use your personal data, including information on how we share your personal data with the Flutter Group, international transfers of your personal data, how we keep your personal data secure and how long we need to keep your personal data for. Click any of the topics below for more details.
As explained in the
About the Flutter
Group section above, tombola is part of the wider Flutter Group and sits within the UK&I division.
We have explicitly called out a number of specific situations in this Privacy Notice where the Flutter Group companies may use your information, including where Sky Betting & Gaming, Poker Stars, Paddy Power and/or Betfair are providing support to tombola as part of the UK&I division’s operations and to other Flutter Group members for marketing purposes, customer services purposes, the prevention of crime, helping to reduce gambling related harm, the provision of staking and gaming services, and to meet legal and regulatory obligations.
Additionally, we may share personal data with the Flutter Group as part of our group internal reporting and assurance in order to facilitate business efficiency and improvements including, but not limited to research across our group, testing of systems and/or suppliers, risk management, the provision of technology, finance or security support, and the development of new products and tools.
We may also in the future share personal data with other members of the Flutter Group for purposes that are related to and compatible with those set out in this Notice. Finally, where we are required by law or regulation to share personal data to members of the Flutter Group for reasons beyond those set out in this Notice, we will be required to do this.
Some of the third-party providers we use, as well as companies within the Flutter Group, are based in, or carry out their activities in, countries outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) and/or outside the UK.
Countries outside the EEA and UK do not always have strong data protection laws. This means that, unless your personal data is being transferred to a country where the European Commission or UK has determined there to be an adequate level of protection, we have to put in place additional protections to ensure that your personal data is protected to the same level as it is within Europe or the UK.
We put these additional protections in place by using standardised contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission (for transfers outside the EEA) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (for transfers outside the UK). Where necessary, we also put in place any additional contractual measures required by local law in any of the countries in which we operate. As and when required, we will also put additional technical or organisational measures in place to ensure that your data is kept safe.
We recognise that online security and data protection is an area of vital importance for all our customers, so it is important to us that you have confidence in the security of your personal details before you register an account. We are committed to employing security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent accidental or unlawful processing, disclosure, destruction, loss, alteration and damage. Our technological security solutions are very advanced and are governed by a mature framework. Our approach is focused on preventing risks. In order to help us in this regard, we employ pseudonymisation and encryption whenever possible to reduce the impact of any potential incidents. As the security of some communications via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you disclose using your internet connection. You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and the Group will accept no liability for any direct, consequential, incidental, indirect, or punitive losses or damages arising out of such an occurrence.
A key principle of data protection is ‘storage limitation’, which means that organisations should only hold onto your personal data for as long as is needed.
At tombola, we have taken steps to ensure that we hold your personal data only as long as we have a valid legal basis or reason to do so, which includes providing you with the Services you have requested, meeting our legal and regulatory obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements.
The length of time for which we keep different types of personal data can vary, depending on why we originally obtained them, the reason we process them and the legal requirements that apply to them.  When setting our data retention and deletion timescales we take into account a range of factors including applicable regulations and standards relating to gambling and gaming, anti-money laundering, taxation, payment processing and complaint handling, the need to prevent or detect crime or other misuses of our Services, and audit requirements.
To fulfil our requirements, some of your personal data will need to be retained for a period of time after you cease to be a customer.  When we no longer need it to fulfil the purposes and legal bases set out in this Notice, we delete it securely.   Subject to us not having a legal or regulatory requirement or a risk management reason for retaining your information for a longer period, your information will not be kept for longer than 7 years from your last login or expiry of a self-exclusion. This allows us to meet our record-keeping obligations in applicable legislation, as well as allowing us to defend ourselves against potential legal claims.
Please note that if you opt to apply an exclusion to your account, your data will be retained for the period of that exclusion, plus a further seven years from the date of the expiry of that exclusion.
In certain circumstances we may be required to retain your information indefinitely. For example, where you elect to permanently exclude yourself from accessing our Services under our procedures on Safe Play, we are obliged to retain your data indefinitely to prevent you from creating new accounts.
We will take all necessary steps to ensure that the privacy of information is maintained for the period of retention. Where we wish to retain any information for analysis purposes, we first anonymise it to the standards approved by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, so that it can no longer be linked back to an individual.
5. YOUR DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
Under data protection law, you have a number of rights which are detailed below. We want to be clear about what those rights mean in practice and how you can exercise them. Please note that some of these rights only apply in specific circumstances and are qualified in several respects by exemptions in Data Protection legislation. We will advise you in our response to your request if we are relying on any such exemptions.

support@tombola.co.uk

You have a right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. Should you wish to make such a request, you should submit a request to
support@tombola.co
.uk.
You will be asked to provide adequate information to identify yourself such as a copy of your photographic identification (ID Card, Driving License or Passport) and any other relevant information such as your account username and email address that will assist us in fulfilling your request.
We may also ask you to complete and return a form, which is not compulsory but helps us to help you by providing the information you are looking for.

Your personal details that you provided to us upon registration;
A copy of all deposits and transactions;
A copy of your interactions with Customer Experience (including live chats, emails, calls, complaints and notes);
Information on the Safe Play self-help tools that you have used (if any);

If there is additional information that you believe we hold on you, please let us know and we will gladly investigate further.
We will fulfil requests wherever possible, but there are occasional situations in which the law requires or permits us to withhold some information (such as where it would involve disclosing information about another person or information which is commercially sensitive), If either of these applies, we will explain this to you.
We will provide our response within one month however if your request is unusually complex and likely to take longer than a month, we will inform you of this and how long the request will take to complete.
You can request us to rectify and correct any personal data that we are processing about you that you believe is incorrect. To make things easier, we provide you with account settings and tools to access the information associated with your account.
You can update your personal details at any time by visiting your ‘My Account’ section online.
If it is something you cannot correct yourself online, such as your name or date of birth (which, for identity verification, account security and fraud prevention reasons, cannot be changed using self-service methods), you should contact our Customer Experience team. Alternatively, please email
support@tombola.co.uk
.
We’ll update inaccuracies promptly, and within a month if you are requesting a more complex change. If we take the decision not to make a change you have requested, we will explain why and make a note on your account to show that you requested the change.  If you disagree with our decision, you have the right to complain to the regulator.
You have the right to request us to erase your personal data where we have no compelling reasons to continue storing or processing your data, and specifically, where one of the following grounds applies:
Where the courts or our regulators have found us to be processing it unlawfully;
Where our original purpose for collecting the data has been completed and we have no other valid legal grounds for continuing to hold it;
Where you have withdrawn your consent for processing and asked us to delete the information we previously used for those purposes; or
Where you have successfully exercised your ‘
right to object’
and there are no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing.
Please note this right only applies in certain circumstances, it is not a guaranteed or absolute right. Personal data on our customers is retained for as long as is reasonably required for our legitimate legal purposes.  These include, but are not limited to;
Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing
Defence of legal claims
Safe Play
Taxation
As is outlined in the
How long we keep your personal data for
section we have legal obligations and other lawful reasons to retain your data after your account is inactive. Generally, your data will be retained for a period of 7 years, so, if you request your data to be erased during this time, we may not be able to uphold your request.
If you still wish to exercise your right, you should contact us on
support@tombola.co.uk
.  Alternatively, please contact our Customer Experience team.
We will respond to your request within a month, and if we uphold your request and erase your data we will also notify any third parties to which the data has been passed, where we are able to do so, and tell you who they are.  If we do not uphold your request, we will tell you why.  If you disagree, you have the
right to complain to the regulator
.
You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we suspend our processing of your personal data, where one of the following grounds applies:
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
The processing is unlawful, and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead;
We no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
You have objected to processing that we perform on the basis of our legitimate interests, and we are verifying whether our legitimate grounds override yours as a data subject.
Where we suspend our processing of your personal data, we will still be permitted to store your personal data, but any other processing of this information will require your consent, subject to certain exemptions.
Where you have obtained the restriction of processing you will be informed by us before the restriction of processing is lifted.
In order to make a request for the restriction of your processing, please contact us on
support@tombola.co.uk

.
You will receive a response within one month.
The right of portability allows you to re-use some of your personal data online by making it available in a commonly used, machine-readable format that can be passed to and used by other organisations. This right applies to data that you have provided to us with your consent, or which was necessary for us to provide you with our products and Services.
You may also have the right to have your personal data transferred by us directly to the other organisation if this is technically feasible.
This is a new initiative, and it is not yet possible to ‘port’ data directly between providers in the betting and gaming industry.  If you wish to exercise this right, you should submit your request to
support@tombola.co.uk
. Alternatively, please contact our Customer Experience team
here
and we will provide you with the following information as a CSV file:
the personal and contact details held in your online account
your gaming history
a list of payments made, and funds withdrawn
Before responding to your request, we will ask you to provide valid proof of identity, and we will provide our response within one month of receiving it.
In future, it may become possible to transfer (or ‘port’) data directly between organisations.  In the meanwhile, if you would like to take your tombola data
to
another provider you should first check that your chosen provider is able to upload data from a CSV file before making your request as above and passing the file to the provider yourself.
You have the right to object to our use of your personal data which is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests. However, we may continue to process your personal data, despite your objection, where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so or where we need to process your personal data in connection with any legal claims.
To exercise your right to object please contact us on
support@tombola.co.uk
. Alternatively, please contact our Customer Experience team
here
and we will respond to you within one month. If we refuse to uphold your request and disagree with our decision on this, you have the right to complain to the regulator.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or has a similarly significant affect on you. This right does not apply where you have provided your explicit consent for us to use your data in this way, where the decisions are needed to enter or perform a contract with us (for example, the terms and conditions of our Services), or where the decision is needed to meet our legal or regulatory obligations.
Where the decisions are made based on your explicit consent, or they are needed to enter or perform a contract with us, you have the right to request human involvement in the decision, to express your point of view or to contest the decision made.
If you have any concerns in relation to automated processing that we may perform you can contact us at any time.
If you believe your data protection or privacy rights have been infringed, or you disagree with a decision we have made about your data protection or privacy rights, you have the right to complain to the data protection regulator for the jurisdiction in which you are based
