That's how important decisions are made: pull a match!
It's that easy: The one who pulls the "Bad Match" is the loser – or the winner! For all the difficult moments in life:
Who takes out the garbage? Who is talking to the sweet girl?
No need to discuss the “who” anymore.
It's true, the first version
has been downloaded over 750,000 times
. It performed as #1 in 13 countries, in the App Stores of Germany, France, Argentina, Austria, UAE, Czech Republic etc.

free update
