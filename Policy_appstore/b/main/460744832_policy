Please use Word Helper responsibly.  If you are playing an online game
				of Scrabble / Lexulous / Words With Friends it's courteous to let the other player know if you are using a helper.  


				Please don't use a Helper, Cheat or Solver to cheat at Scrabble, Lexulous or Words With Friends.  You'll
				have much more fun if you use it in practice games to learn how to improve your game and get better
				at playing word games in general.

				If Word Helper suggests a word you don't know, you can click on the word to look it up in a
				dictionary so you're enriching your vocabulary.
				Be nice to each other, give freely, and it will come back to you :-)
