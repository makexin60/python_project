1. What information is being collected and how is it used?
1.1 App Users
Some of our Apps require registration to access certain functions, services or content or ask for you to opt in to our database for email communications. You will know what information is being collected via these processes when you complete required details prior to submission (including which information is mandatory).
Once you start using our Apps, we may track and keep a record of the pages overall that our users you visit. We do this via tracking a UDID. We collect this data from groups of users to get a sense of how people are using our Apps and which content and areas are most popular. This helps us improve what we offer on our Apps.
If we wish to send you marketing emails, you may be given an opportunity to opt in or out (as applicable) from receiving these from the BMJ Group.
For users who have opted to receive marketing emails from BMJ Group, and visit our websites through links provided in these emails, we may send back information about your website usage to our third party email direct marketing provider. This is for the purpose of understanding the effectiveness of our email marketing campaigns and for targeting future email campaigns.
1.2 What else do we collect when you use our website?
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and use it to contact you in response and/or to update our records. We may use all information to enforce our legal rights and protect against unauthorised access, use, activity and/or copying, either personally or via third party contractors and advisors. This may involve using your name and subscription details on a database with other publishersï¿½ data for detection purposes.

This information is provided to us as daily logged files. In order to help us develop our services, we may provide such aggregate information to third parties. The statistics however will not include any information that can be used to identify any individual. We may contact you to notify you about changes to our service. We also may send you non marketing emails for the purpose of inviting you to partake in surveys or market research which we conduct or which third parties are conducting. In addition to responding to complaints or claims received or discovered referred to above or any breaches of our relevant terms of use, all information supplied or collected by us may be used to enforce our legal rights and protect against unauthorised access, use, activity and/or copying, either personally or via third party contractors and advisors and/or protect the rights, property, or personal safety other users of the websites and the public.

4.1 Security
We understand that the security of your information is important to you. We also understand that our continued success as a publisher relies on our ability to communicate with you in a secure manner. We adhere to the highest standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in our operations. We use several measures to authenticate your identity when you visit our sites or access out content. We also take steps to protect your information as it travels the internet, and to make sure all information is as secure as possible against unauthorised access and use (for example, by hackers). We review our security measures regularly.
Despite our best efforts, and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet, or anywhere else. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our sites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
4.2 Email
Any email between you and the BMJ Group is not encrypted. It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see below).
4.3 Data within our walls
The information we collect about people is stored in secure environments that are not available to any other individual or party. We have mechanisms in place to protect data. One such mechanism is called a "firewall." A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through. It safeguards our computer systems and your information. We also use system and application logs to track all access. We review these logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.
