Great Gift for Dinosaur Loving Kids!

If you have a kid in your life who loves dinosaurs, I have the gift for you.  It's great for a variety of ages.  There are coloring pages and sticker pages.  There are 12 colored markers included and 500 stickers!  It's simply a dino lover's dream come true!  Young and older children alike will be able to entertain themselves for hours and they can use their imagination while they're at it.  The pages are slick, sleek and shiny.  The finished product is gorgeous and lots of fun.

The Dino Fun Sticker Book works great for the little ones.  So many stickers and pages to keep the kiddos entertained. They are easy to peel off and stick easily to their matching page. Some animals do not look realistic but that is the fun part about this, kids can come up with anything using this book. This sticker book + marker set is great for a little free draw station in a classroom setting or can work well for individual kids as well. Kids love stickers so this is a great find, it is on the pricer side I would say, even with the markers.

The stickers are a weird collection of out of focus photos and cartoons and mismatched themes. I guess kids don't really care...still on the expensive side. There is no carrying case for the markers which is annoying and not travel friendly. The stickers do stick and it did entertain my 3 year old for 39 minutes

My Nieces Love This & So Do I

This Dino Fun Sticker Book is great for travel and any time. The stickers are fun, colorful, and easy to peel off and stick. There are so many great stickers in this amazing book.
The Dino Fun Sticker Book comes in a lovely bright kit box. The kit arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Inside the box is the spiral-bound book, which is wonderful. It's spiral-bound, which makes the book a lot easier to use and allows you to lay the pages out flat. I love that.
It is such a well-designed kit for kids.  Everything is carefully designed to be fun but easy to use and beautiful.  I am so impressed with everything in the kit.
My niece loved this kit so much that she insisted on taking it to bed with her.  She refused to let go of it, but did let me put the coloring pens and stickers away.
Truthfully, I have been playing with it as well. The entire kit is perfect. I love the 12 coloring pens. The colors are vibrant, and the pens are easy for little hands to hold and use.  They have thick barrels, and the tops come off easily.  I especially love how evenly the ink from the pen is dispensed.  It's consistent and fluid.
There are also pages for coloring.  You can add stickers if you want.  I love the duck page the best, but all of the pages are great, and there is a wide range of topics to select from, including fashions hanging in the closet.
This kit provides many hours of activities and play for adults and kids.  Everything arrived exactly as promised, and I was thrilled.  I will be buying this again to give as a gift.  It's great even for big kids like me.  Kudos to the manufacturer.  5 Stars

I like the Dino Fun Sticker Book for Toddlers-Kids Travel Essentials-500 Stickers +14 Coloring Pages+12 Coloring Pens, with a few exceptions. The product listing says that the book "mostly" replicates the true colors of animals and everyday items, using realistic images instead of cartoons. I question the "mostly" part. There is quite  a bit of cartoonish animals. Of course, the dinosaurs are cartoonish. No one has ever seen a real dinosaur. But I posted a photo of one of the sticker pages to show how cartoonish the pig, puppy, and goat look, with their huge eyes and goofy expressions. They are not realistic at all. Then the image of the lion looks like a photograph of a stuffed toy. My guess is that stock photos were used to make this product, explaining the wide variety of styles.
Secondly, I don't think there are 26 activities and coloring. There are two activities including coloring. The children can either play with stickers on the 13 sticker pages, or they can color one of the 14 coloring pages. At least the sticker pages can be reusable, if the child is careful. The stickers are hard to pull up and put down, so they can be easily torn. But they can be lifted and moved about on the background pages. The child could be encouraged to make up a story about his sticker pages - so maybe there are three activities after all.
I do like the background pages. They are very colorful. One shows a neighborhood at night - very cartoonish in style. The coordinating stickers are all dinosaurs dressed up like people in a neighborhood. There is a chef, a fireman, a mom with a baby, an artist with an easel, one skateboarding, one with an abacus, etc.
Then there is a mountains and meadow background. The stickers include the dog, pig, and goat mentioned before, along with butterflies and more dinosaurs. The third background is under the sea, with whales, shark, octopus and all sorts of underwater life, and another dinosaur. And some land animals - not sure where they'd be under the water! They include caribou and polar bear. Another background shows a river and trees - it doesn't look like a jungle to me, but the stickers have cheetah and black bear, tiger and gorilla, and of course, a dinosaur. More backgrounds include a golden savannah, a home's backyard with a dog house, inside a bakery with stickers of food to fill the shelves, a vegetable stand, a big wall to hold dozens of clock stickers, a clothing shop, a sandy beach, a divided highway, and finally, a living room with a Christmas tree sticker.
If your child loves to play with stickers, this is a great gift. Maybe even a great travel toy, if your child knows to put stickers in the book and not all over the car.

I like the Dino Fun Sticker Book for Toddlers-Kids Travel Essentials-500 Stickers +14 Coloring Pages+12 Coloring Pens, with a few exceptions. The product listing says that the book "mostly" replicates the true colors of animals and everyday items, using realistic images instead of cartoons. I question the "mostly" part. There is quite  a bit of cartoonish animals. Of course, the dinosaurs are cartoonish. No one has ever seen a real dinosaur. But I posted a photo of one of the sticker pages to show how cartoonish the pig, puppy, and goat look, with their huge eyes and goofy expressions. They are not realistic at all. Then the image of the lion looks like a photograph of a stuffed toy. My guess is that stock photos were used to make this product, explaining the wide variety of styles.
Secondly, I don't think there are 26 activities and coloring. There are two activities including coloring. The children can either play with stickers on the 13 sticker pages, or they can color one of the 14 coloring pages. At least the sticker pages can be reusable, if the child is careful. The stickers are hard to pull up and put down, so they can be easily torn. But they can be lifted and moved about on the background pages. The child could be encouraged to make up a story about his sticker pages - so maybe there are three activities after all.
I do like the background pages. They are very colorful. One shows a neighborhood at night - very cartoonish in style. The coordinating stickers are all dinosaurs dressed up like people in a neighborhood. There is a chef, a fireman, a mom with a baby, an artist with an easel, one skateboarding, one with an abacus, etc.
Then there is a mountains and meadow background. The stickers include the dog, pig, and goat mentioned before, along with butterflies and more dinosaurs. The third background is under the sea, with whales, shark, octopus and all sorts of underwater life, and another dinosaur. And some land animals - not sure where they'd be under the water! They include caribou and polar bear. Another background shows a river and trees - it doesn't look like a jungle to me, but the stickers have cheetah and black bear, tiger and gorilla, and of course, a dinosaur. More backgrounds include a golden savannah, a home's backyard with a dog house, inside a bakery with stickers of food to fill the shelves, a vegetable stand, a big wall to hold dozens of clock stickers, a clothing shop, a sandy beach, a divided highway, and finally, a living room with a Christmas tree sticker.
If your child loves to play with stickers, this is a great gift. Maybe even a great travel toy, if your child knows to put stickers in the book and not all over the car.
