Privacy Policy
1. Information we collect
Members of the BibleMemory.com website have the option of creating an account, in order to store memory verses and track their progress.  We store basic personal information which is voluntarily given by the user, such as a username, email address, and password.  We also allow members to store the following information which helps us provide a positive user experience while memorizing scripture.
1. User preferences for interacting with the website and/or mobile app
2. Statistics on verses memorized
3. Verses entered or selected by the user, along with supporting data
4. Bible memory groups and message wall posts
2. Maintaining your information
All of your account information can be accessed from your User Profile page.  You will be taken to this page immediately after creating a new account.  To return to the user profile page later, hover your mouse over your name at the top right, and click 'My Profile'. To delete all of your data, navigate to
https://biblememory.com/account/
and press the "Delete My Account" button.
3. Email Communications
BibleMemory.com makes use of email to contact members in certain situations.  Members may opt out of any or all forms of email communication from the User Profile page.
1. Weekly or Daily Review
2. Important Account or Web Site Updates
Review is essential for successful scripture memorization, and all members will by default receive a weekly email detailing their memorization progress.  The frequency of this review can be changed or turned off from the User Profile page.  The options are Weekly Review, Daily Review and Do Not Review.  Select 'Do Not Review' to stop receiving all review reminders.
Bugs do arise from time to time, and we may need to contact you if your account is affected in some way.  If you prefer not to be contacted, just deselect the option to be notified of important account updates on your user profile page.
4. Securing your information
All personal information collected by our website is stored on our secure server.
Your information will never be shared or sold to any third party.
Passwords are strongly encrypted, and are not retrievable.  In the event that you forget your password, please use our password recovery feature which will generate a new password and email it to you.
5. Our Privacy Policy

6. Addendum: Bible Intelligence Feature
In addition to the information outlined in our general Privacy Policy, the following details apply specifically to the
Bible Intelligence
feature in the Bible Memory App.
1. The Bible Intelligence feature allows users to request commentary on selected Bible verses. The only data sent to our external Large Language Model (LLM) service is the
verse reference(s)
you have chosen for commentary. No other personal information or data related to your account or usage is shared with the LLM service provider.
2. The Bible Intelligence feature operates entirely
off-device
, meaning that the LLM-powered commentary is generated externally through secure API requests. This ensures efficiency and scalability while maintaining the security of your personal data.
3. All verse reference data passed to the LLM service is securely transmitted and processed. We do not share, sell, or store this data beyond what is necessary to deliver the requested commentary. No personally identifiable information (such as your username or email) is ever shared with the LLM service.
4. By using the Bible Intelligence feature, you consent to the transmission of the selected verse references to our LLM service provider for the purpose of generating commentary. You can choose which verses to submit, and no additional information will be sent without your explicit interaction.
5. Any updates or changes to the Bible Intelligence feature or this policy will be reflected in future versions of this addendum and in our general Privacy Policy. Please check back periodically for updates.
