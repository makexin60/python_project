We do not collect personal information from users of our apps. We do track anonymous app usage patterns using Flurry Analytics so we can understand our product's performance and improve it over time. The app includes the ability to share content via email, twitter, facebook and text message using Apple's share sheet. Some game items can be purchased for real money via in-app-purchases. If you don't want to use this feature please disable in-app purchases in your device's settings. Please send us your questions and concerns: developer@masalagames.com
