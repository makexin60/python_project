Privacy Policy
forScore, LLC is based in Vancouver, Washington, USA. This privacy policy applies to all of our apps, except as noted below.
No Data Collected
We don’t offer user accounts and we don’t collect any information about you through any of our apps at any time. Unless you email us directly to ask a question or provide feedback, we’ll never even know you bought our apps.
Transaction verification
Any of our apps that are distributed by Apple may transmit anonymized receipt data to our servers for transaction validation purposes. This data includes information concerning all transactions conducted by Apple on our behalf, regardless of price (free or paid) or method (App Store or in-app purchase). This data is used solely for verification purposes, contains no personally-identifiable information, and is not logged or stored by us in any way.
forScore, forScore mini
The additional notes in this section apply equally to the apps “forScore” and the discontinued iPhone-only version of forScore, “forScore mini.”
On-device data recording with Dashboard
If you choose to enable it, forScore can record usage statistics locally and present them to you through the Dashboard suite of features. These features are provided solely for your benefit and no information is sent anywhere by us ever. Usage data is stored exclusively on your device (and within any whole-device backups) and can be removed from the app at any time.
Face Gestures
On devices that support face tracking, forScore Pro subscribers may choose to enable face gestures which allow forScore to monitor facial features and turn pages without any direct physical interaction. This data is used solely to provide this feature and is not logged, collected, or shared in any way, ever.
Data collected by Apple
Apple may collect data about your usage of their products, including usage specific to our apps. Your data stored within our apps may also be backed up by Apple and stored on their servers. Apple’s policies govern their collection and usage of your data, and you can learn more about their policies by visiting

iCloud Syncing
If you enable it, forScore can sync your content, metadata, and some settings between each of your personal devices using Apple’s iCloud service and your iCloud account. Details such as account management, server location, storage and transmission methods, security, and legal concerns are all controlled by Apple’s policies and terms of service or by any third parties Apple confers these responsibilities to. forScore, LLC does not host any of this content and is not responsible in any way for the information you choose to sync, including its legality or integrity.
Third-party services
forScore provides access to third-party content and cloud storage services (“Services”) so users can upload and download files without leaving our apps. These services require network access to function and may collect one or more types of data through the course of providing their services. We do not communicate any information to them except for authentication purposes and the normal transmission of data you explicitly choose to upload or download. These services are governed by each company’s own policies, and each of them is clearly identified by its name and logo within forScore and forScore mini. By using these services you are agreeing to their policies.
