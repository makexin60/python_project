DONATE
As a
fulltime pastor
with little free time, I do what I can to keep the app as one of the
    best. I will always keep the primary content of this app
free
.
Study Tools
in-app purchase
proceeds pay for the yearly developer fees and server hosting for
    content.
All
donations via PayPal
go to improving Holy Bible
    and
not directly
to my ministry. However, the less I have to invest from in-app purchases to
    Holy Bible helps extend my ministry expenses.
