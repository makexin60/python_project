Use of Cookies
We use may use cookies on the Site to personalize user experiences. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the Site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site’s features that you customized. We may occasionally opt to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but do not allow other companies to place cookies on our Site unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into the Site a site that relies on third-party cookies). You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other Web sites you visit.
Use of Web Beacons
Web pages on the Site may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes also called single-pixel gifs - that allow the Site to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. The Site may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Some of these web beacons may be placed by third-party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views. The Site prohibits web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
Use of Client Login Features
The Client Login portion of the Site uses unique user information to identify and provide secure sign-in for certain users. In order to sign in to this portion of the Site, authorized users will be asked to type the login name and password provided to them by GoFormz employees and/or their agents. For additional information about or assistance with Client Login features and usage, please contact your GoFormz sales, technical or administrative representative.
Data Controller and Processor
GoFormz is the controller of your personal data processed in connection with the Site. Note that we may also process personal data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of services to customers, in which case we are the processor of personal data. If we are the processor of your personal data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
Lawful Bases for Processing
We will only process your personal data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing may include contractual necessity, our “legitimate interests,” as further described below, and consent.
Contractual Necessity: When you purchase our products and services, we process your contact information (e.g., name, phone number, address, email address) as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service or other agreement with you, which enables us to provide you with the products and services you request. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Site or our products and services that require such data.
Legitimate Interest: We may also process your contact information and other categories of personal data described in the “Collection of personal information” section above for our legitimate interest purposes.
Examples of these legitimate interests include:
Operation and improvement of our business, products and services
Marketing of our products and services
Provision of customer support
Protection from fraud or security threats
Protecting the security of your account with us
Providing you with a sign-in method
Compliance with legal obligations
Completion of corporate transactions
Consent: In some cases, we process personal data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process personal data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection. If you provide us with opt-in consent to receive marketing information from GoFormz, we will process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about our products and services. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent any time by selecting "unsubscribe" in the marketing email or email us at privacy@goformz.com.
Other Processing Grounds: From time to time we may also need to process personal data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
Choice and Updating Your Information and Preferences
We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to authenticate the identity of any individual seeking access to personal information. We may provide web pages or other mechanisms on our Site through which you can update subscription preferences. You can also contact us to update your personal information or change your preferences. Our contact information for these purposes is by email at privacy@goformz.com. If you receive a marketing communication from us by email, you may also opt out of receiving future email marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions provided in that email. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to transactions you initiate, your customer account, your use of our Site, or other business matters, and that these communications may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from marketing communications.
In accordance with our routine record keeping and applicable law, we may delete certain records that contain your personal information. We are under no obligation to store such information indefinitely, and we disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of that information. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. Also, if you have posted any User Submissions to a Community Forum, these communications cannot generally be removed.
Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at privacy@goformz.com.
Enforcement of this Privacy Policy
We will make our best effort to protect your information and enforce the measures outlined in this policy. If you have questions regarding this policy, please contact GoFormz at the postal and/or email addresses below.
Changes to this Policy
We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will also revise the “updated” date at the top of this Privacy page and may also send you a notification directly. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and any updates.
