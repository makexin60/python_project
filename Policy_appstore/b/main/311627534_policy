This paragraph contains instructions for all third-party vendors providing services to and third-party business partners of Nationwide. This paragraph does not apply to individual consumers.
If a California consumer submits a CCPA rights request directly to one of Nationwide’s third-party vendors or business partners, the vendor or partner must instruct the consumer to visit this policy and submit the request through one of the approved methods listed below (webform or toll-free telephone number).
For your security, your request, and our responses to it, will be available for you to access for 30 days, after which they will be deleted. If you would like to access your personal information again, please submit another request.
Please note that the CCPA does not require us to search for personal information if we:
Do not maintain the personal information in a searchable or reasonably accessible format;
Maintain the personal information solely for legal or compliance purposes; and
Do not sell the personal information and do not use it for any commercial purpose.
Please note that the CCPA does not require us to delete your personal information if it is necessary for Nationwide to:
Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, conduct activities reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between Nationwide and you;
Ensure the security and integrity of information (such as detecting security incidents and protecting against and prosecuting malicious, deceptive, or illegal activity like fraud);
Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law;
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act;
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the businesses’ deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, if you have provided informed consent;
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with a consumer’s expectations based on their relationship with Nationwide; or
Comply with a legal obligation.
Additionally, we may retain your personal information in our backup or archive systems until the retention period of those systems expire, as permitted by the CCPA.
In order to effectively evaluate your request, we require that you provide us with documentation supporting your request by uploading it to our secure online portal or via postal mail to the following address:

Nationwide does not sell or share your personal information in exchange for monetary consideration. However, we may allow certain third parties, such as advertising networks, social networks, and data analytics providers, to use cookies and related tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixel tags, and flash objects (collectively, “Cookie(s)”), to collect information about your visits to our websites or mobile apps and use that information to deliver advertisements relevant to your interests. Information collected about you on our websites or mobile apps by third parties could be combined with other information that you have provided to them or that they have collected from your use of their services. Under the CCPA, these disclosures may constitute a “sale” when the personal information is exchanged for non-monetary consideration (anything of value) or sharing when the personal information is disclosed for cross context behavioral advertising purposes.
Over the last 12 months, the categories of personal information Nationwide may have shared or sold, as these terms are defined under the CCPA, include: identifiers; internet, browsing, or other network information; inferences; and geolocation.
To opt out of the collection of your personal information using Cookies for advertising or analytics purposes, you can modify your Cookie settings using the Cookie Preference Center, which may be accessed through the banner when first visiting our websites or at any time via the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in the footer of our websites.

official Global Privacy Control website

Nationwide does not use or disclose your sensitive personal information for purposes other than as permitted by the CCPA, so there is no need for you to request to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information.
We may retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes described in our privacy policies or any notice provided at the time of collection, in accordance with our legal obligations, our records retention policies, or as otherwise permitted by law. For example, we may have a legal obligation to retain information relating to your agreements with us or claims relating to your products or services. We will delete your information once the legal obligation expires or after the period of time specified in our records retention policies.
Additionally, we may retain the information relating to your CCPA request in accordance with our legal obligations and records retention policies. We may retain the information about your request to track and fulfill your request. Please note that we will maintain a record of your request and all correspondence for at least 24 months. We collect, store, or process your information in compliance with our privacy policies.

If a child is the protected person, the child’s parent or guardian must assert these rights.
Except with the express consent of the person making the request for an order of protection, Nationwide will not disclose to the policyholder or another insured covered under the policy the address, telephone number, or any other personally identifying information of the covered individual or children residing with the covered individual.
