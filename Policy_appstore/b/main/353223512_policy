The purpose and reach of this privacy notice
This Notice describes the types of Personal Data that Thermo Fisher Scientific may collect or process, how we may use and disclose that Personal Data, and how you may exercise any rights you may have regarding our processing of your Personal Data.
This Notice applies to Personal Data collected or processed by us online (through websites, applications, email, and otherwise) (“
Online Services
”); when we process your Personal Data for your potential participation as a research subject in clinical trials; when we process Personal Data for your potential participation in clinical trials; when we process your Personal Data in connection with your purchase of one of our products or services as a consumer; when we process Personal Data for your potential participation in clinical trials as an investigator or a member of the investigator team; when we process medical information and in connection with post-approval pharmacovigilance and adverse events, complaints, and reports; when we provide products or services to you, your doctor, hospital, medical treatment or scanning facility, or other healthcare provider (collectively, “
Healthcare Provider
,” which refers both to the Healthcare Provider institution, organization, or company, and individuals employed by or working for or with such organization), or your patients; and in other situations where you interact with us, including but not limited to interacting with or visiting our sites and offices or our events (e.g., tradeshows and conferences) (such products, services, Online Services, and other systems collectively, the “

Thermo Fisher Scientific may have other unique privacy notices that apply to certain specific situations, including informed consent forms for use in interventional and observational medical research. To the extent you were provided with a different privacy notice or policy and those policies or notices apply, those policies or notices will govern our interactions with you, not this one.
If you provide us with Personal Data of anyone other than yourself (such as a patient or family member), please note that you are responsible for complying with all applicable privacy and data protection laws prior to providing that information to Thermo Fisher Scientific (including obtaining consent, if required).
Please review this Notice carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by providing us your Personal Data or otherwise interacting with us, you are agreeing to this Notice.
The Thermo Fisher Scientific subsidiary or affiliate with whom you, your employer, your Healthcare Provider, or your patient is interacting or who owns and operates the Product or Service is, where applicable, the entity responsible for the collection and use of your Personal Data (known in some jurisdictions as the “data controller”). A list of the data controllers can be found
here
, and contact details can be found in the Contact Us section at the end of this Notice and in the list of data controllers.
Information collected
What is Personal Data?
“
Personal Data
” is any information—as electronically or otherwise recorded—that can be used to identify a person or that we can link directly to an individual, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, or credit card number, as applicable. Personal Data in some jurisdictions can include information that indirectly identifies a person, such as a unique number assigned to a patient by a Healthcare Provider or a clinical trial participant, even absent other identifying information.
Personal Data may include information considered sensitive in some jurisdictions, such as biometric information, genetic information, medical and health information, financial account information, geolocation, ethnic or racial origin, information concerning your sex life or your sexual orientation, and other information. Please note that, for patients, as described below, we may receive information about you from your Healthcare Provider or others, when legally permitted. Data that could be considered Sensitive Personal Data is highlighted with an asterisk (*) in the summary charts below.
We will process any Personal Data we collect in accordance with applicable law and as described in this Notice (unless, as explained above, a separate policy or notice governs). In some circumstances, if you do not provide us with your Personal Data, certain Products and Services may be unavailable to you.
Below is a  high-level summary of the types of Personal Data we may collect from you.  Following that high-level summary is additional detail and information on how we collect, process, and use Personal Data and the potential recipients of your Personal Data, and how we have done so in the preceding 12 months. Some jurisdictions require us to state the legal bases for processing your Personal Data, which are included below, but please note that not all jurisdictions may recognize all legal bases.

Do-Not-Track Signals
Certain web browsers and other programs may transmit “opt-out” signals, also called a Global Privacy Control (or GPC) signal (hereinafter referred to as “GPC Signals”), to websites with which the browser communicates. In most cases you will need to change your web browser’s settings or add an application to your web browser to enable your browser to send a GPC signal. For users that access our websites from U.S. states that have laws requiring recognition of GPC Signals, we will recognize and apply the GPC Signal to inactivate all of the cookies for that website, except for cookies that are necessary for the website to operate (“Strictly Necessary Cookies”). Additionally, if you are accessing our websites from one of these states, you can determine if your browser GPC Signal has been recognized by clicking on the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of the website that will include a short message at the top of the preference center indicating that your GPC Signal has been received. For users from states not currently requiring recognition of the GPC Signal, our website servers may recognize and apply the GPC Signal for only targeted advertising cookies, but will not apply the GPC Signal to functional, performance, or social media cookies. Further, a specific GPC Signal acknowledgment notice will not be included in the preference center, but you can always check and adjust your cookie settings by going to the Your Privacy Choices link in the footer of this website.
