When interacting with our chatbot, you consent to the monitoring and recording of your conversations. We will notify you within the chat if it is being recorded. These technologies may also be used to track interactions with our emails and content, and to improve our Services.

If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor. Consent is not always required if the technology is essential for providing requested functionalities or services. For details on how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, please see the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section below.
12. Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookies are small data files placed on your device when you visit our websites. They serve various functions. In some regions, we require your consent for certain cookies, which you can manage through our cookie platform. If consent is not provided, these cookies will not be used. Essential cookies are necessary for our websites to function properly.
Overall cookies can enable us to identify and authenticate you and remember your preferences so we can enhance your experience on our websites. They also help us serve you ads relevant to your professional interests, to provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers and customers, to understand and improve our Services, and to know when content has been shown to you. Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by us may also set third party cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set.
Cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our website features so, if you decline or delete them, then certain parts of our websites may not work properly. Even if you decline or delete cookies, you may continue to be served with advertisements; however, they will not be tailored to your preferences, usage patterns, or professional interests. We use several different types of cookies on our websites, including:
Strictly Necessary or Essential Cookies
Strictly necessary cookies facilitate the operation of our websites. Without the use of these cookies, portions of our websites would not function properly.
Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites and to authenticate your identity.
Performance Cookies

Functional Cookies
These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization.
Targeting Cookies
We may use behavioral advertising cookies in order to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your professional interests when you visit websites on and off our network.
These cookies may be set through our websites by our advertising partners.
Although our websites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in this section (including by removing cookies or by setting your web browser settings to refuse cookies and similar technologies). Many web browsers operate using different identifiers so you may need to adjust your settings in each web browser and for each computer or device. Additionally, if you only delete your cookies, then you may need to remove cookies from your device after every website visit. You may block cookies entirely by disabling cookie use in your browser or by setting your browser to ask for your permission before setting a cookie. The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties, including our Partners, when you access their websites, is subject to those third parties’ privacy policies, and not this Policy.

13. Global Privacy Control
TechTarget may also sell or share Personal Data with third parties for marketing and advertising purposes. Individuals may also opt-out of the sale or sharing of their Personal Data if you have a Global Privacy Control (GPC) setting enabled on your browser. In those states where it is required, if you have enabled the GPC signal, we will treat this as a request to opt out of sales, sharing, and advertising for device and browser information.

In accordance with applicable laws, our websites use cookies, chatbots, tracking pixels, and similar technologies to collect information and enhance user experience. When interacting with our chatbot, you consent to the monitoring and recording of your conversations. We will notify you within the chat if it is being recorded. These technologies may also be used to track interactions with our emails and content, and to improve our Services. Tracking technologies are used to determine your ability to receive HTML-based messages as well as whether an HTML email message has been opened or previewed. If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor. Consent is not always required if the technology is essential for providing requested functionalities or services. For details on how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, please see the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section below.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookies are small data files placed on your device when you visit our websites. They serve various functions. In some regions, we require your consent for certain cookies, which you can manage through our cookie platform. If consent is not provided, these cookies will not be used. Essential cookies are necessary for our websites to function properly.
Overall cookies can enable us to identify and authenticate you and remember your preferences so we can enhance your experience on our websites. They also help us serve you ads relevant to your professional interests, to provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers and customers, to understand and improve our Services, and to know when content has been shown to you. Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by us may also set third party cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set.
Cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our website features so, if you decline or delete them, then certain parts of our websites may not work properly. Even if you decline or delete cookies, you may continue to be served with advertisements; however, they will not be tailored to your preferences, usage patterns, or professional interests. We use several different types of cookies on our websites, including:
Strictly Necessary or Essential Cookies

Although our websites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in this section (including by removing cookies or by setting your web browser settings to refuse cookies and similar technologies). Many web browsers operate using different identifiers so you may need to adjust your settings in each web browser and for each computer or device. Additionally, if you only delete your cookies, then you may need to remove cookies from your device after every website visit. You may block cookies entirely by disabling cookie use in your browser or by setting your browser to ask for your permission before setting a cookie. The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties, including our Partners, when you access their websites, is subject to those third parties’ privacy policies, and not this Policy.

We are deemed a “data controller” as it relates to any personal data collected in connection with your use of our Websites. If you use the website of our subsidiary

Subject to your consent, where applicable, our Websites may also use cookies, chatbots, tracking pixels, transparent or clear GIFs, web beacons, and other similar technologies to collect or receive information. If you use our chatbot, know that when you share personal data, you’re giving us permission to monitor, collect, and record the personal data. We will have a disclaimer that your chat will be recorded and monitored within the chat before you share any personal data.

Additionally, we may use similar tracking technologies when you read an email, newsletter, or otherwise interact with content from us and to improve our Premium Services. Consent may not be required where the technology is necessary to provide a specific functionality or service that you request. These tracking technologies may include first party cookies (e.g., those placed by the website being visited) and third-party cookies (e.g., those placed by a website other than the one being visited). For more information about how we use these tracking technologies, please refer to the section entitled “Cookies and Similar Technologies” below.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookies are small data files which are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an online service. Cookies have many different functions. In some regions, the use of certain cookies requires your consent and you will be prompted, through a cookie management platform, to choose to provide it or not provide it. If you do not provide it, those cookies will not be placed onto your device or utilized to collect specific information. Some cookie usage is essential for our Websites to work.
Overall cookies can enable us to identify and authenticate you and remember your preferences so we can enhance your experience on our Websites. They also help us serve you ads relevant to your professional interests, to provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers and customers, to understand and improve our service, and to know when content has been shown to you. Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

Even if you decline or delete cookies, you will continue to be served with advertisements; however, they will not be tailored to your preferences, usage patterns, or professional interests. We use several different types of cookies on our Websites, including:
Strictly Necessary or Functional Cookies.
Necessary cookies facilitate the operation of our Websites. Without the use of these cookies, portions of our Websites would not function properly. For example, we use these cookies to help us identify which of our visitors have previously registered in order to access our Premium Services.
Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our Websites and to authenticate your identity. For example, we use functional cookies to manage our cookie consent management platform.
Cookies that require consent in some regions (e.g., the EU/EEA):
Performance Cookies. These cookies monitor the performance of our Websites and how users interact with them. For example, these cookies collect information such as how often users visit our Websites, what pages they visit when they do, and what other websites they used prior to coming to our Websites. These cookies also provide us with information that allows us to improve our Websites and services.
Behavioral Advertising Cookies. We may use behavioral advertising cookies in order to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your professional interests when you visit websites on and off our network. For example, these cookies analyze information about your interests and your browsing history and provide you with advertisements on and off our network that match these interests. Behavioral advertising is a type of advertising that is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time – so it is different than advertising you may see when you are looking for something online using a search engine or on a website you may be visiting at a particular time. For example, you may be doing research on products and services related to data center virtualization. If a Partner that provides data center virtualization products and services is conducting an advertising campaign with us, then we may serve you with an advertisement related to that Partner.
Although our Websites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in this section (including by removing cookies or by setting your web browser settings to refuse cookies and similar technologies).
