Data Privacy and Protection
Protecting your data privacy is important to us!
Many of the hvv services we make available to you via the internet or the hvv App can only be used, however, if you communicate your personal data for processing to the relevant party (the data controller) responsible for providing them. For this reason we would like to explain to you how your data are treated.
