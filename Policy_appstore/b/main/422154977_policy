ACTIVE Network Privacy Notice
Active Network, LLC (‚ÄúActive,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù ‚Äúour‚Äù) is a leading provider of activity and participant management solutions (collectively, our ‚ÄúSolutions‚Äù). Cities, universities, summer camps, fitness chains, endurance competition and athletic organizations, and other clients use our Solutions, including but not limited to
ACTIVENet
and
ACTIVEWorks Endurance
, to register participants for their events (‚ÄúEvents‚Äù), to collect and maintain important information about their participants, to communicate with their participants, and to collect payments from their participants. We also maintain a publicly accessible website,
Active.com
, that enables fitness and recreation enthusiasts to search for or browse events hosted by our clients using event location, event type, event date, or other relevant criteria as filters; to register for events that interest them; to participate in like-minded communities; and to track their event registrations and results. This Privacy Notice (‚ÄúNotice‚Äù) describes how Active and our subsidiaries and affiliates collect and process personal information from and about subscribers and visitors to and users of our websites and branded social media pages (‚ÄúSites‚Äù), our web-based and mobile applications (‚ÄúApps‚Äù), our email communications and newsletters, and any of our Solutions that link to or expressly reference this Notice.
If you are an end user of our Sites, Apps, or Solutions, then our privacy practices may vary depending on the nature of your interactions with us and the jurisdiction in which you are located. Depending on the Sites, Apps, or Solutions with which you interact, Active may collect and process personal information from or about you for its own purposes, or it may do so exclusively for its clients‚Äô purposes, in accordance with Active‚Äôs contract terms with them. If you interact with us through a client who has purchased an Active Solution to facilitate the management of their events, then that client may be a ‚Äúdata controller‚Äù for your personal information, and you should consult their privacy notice, in addition to this one. This Notice does not describe how our clients may use your personal information when they act as a data controller with respect to such personal information, and Active will redirect any inquiries that you make about client processing activities to the appropriate client.
If you are a client, please note that information about our disclosures, transfers and other processing of your personal information is described in your contract with Active and in the documentation provided to you at or before onboarding. For clients, this Notice therefore acts a supplement, not a replacement, to that documentation, and it relates specifically to the personal information we collect through our Sites.
For some products and services, and in certain specialized contests, we will provide additional privacy notices before collecting your personal information. For example, Active maintains specific privacy notices for job applicants, employees, and contractors, which are made available to those individuals in the proper context. Moreover, please be aware that not all of the information in this Notice will be directly applicable to our handling of your personal information. This Notice provides an overview of the possible circumstances in which we may interact with your personal information. If you have any questions, you may contact us at
privacy@activenetwork.com
or by using the methods provided in the ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù section below.
The remainder of this Notice is organized as follows:

To this end:
We maintain an agreement entered into by ACTIVE, its parent and affiliate companies which requires each such entity to comply with applicable law wherever personal information is transferred within ACTIVE;
When we transfer your personal information outside ACTIVE or to third parties who help provide our Sites, Apps, or Solutions, we obtain contractual commitments from them and enter into standard contractual clauses where applicable to protect your personal information; and
When we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully evaluate the legal basis for such requests and our obligations to data subjects.
In some cases, you may have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above.
The EU-U.S. and UK-U.S. DataPrivacy Frameworks

Active is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the DPF, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. ¬†Active complies with DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and the UK, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Active‚Äôs compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. ¬†In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Active commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. ¬†If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit

We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction, or loss, or unauthorized disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned. ¬†As the security of personal information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by signing off after using a shared computer, using a password on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing your password. You should never share your log-in information with others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
We retain the personal information we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is and how we use it. In some contexts, we will provide additional information about retention as you use the Sites, Apps, and Solutions. ¬†When we collect your personal information, we will retain it only for as long as is necessary to complete the legitimate business or legal purposes for which we collected it. ¬†The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you, for example, for as long as you have an account with us or continue to use our services, and the length of time thereafter during which we may have a legitimate need to reference personal information to address issues that may arise;
Whether there is a contractual obligation to which we are subject, for example, our contracts with our customers may specify a certain period of time during which we are required to maintain the information on behalf of our customers;
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them; and
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position, such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations.
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MARKETING, PROFILING AND AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
To protect your privacy rights and to ensure you have control over how we manage marketing with you:
We will take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level and only send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you; and
We will provide accessible means for you to update or correct your personal profile, or change your preferences for the way in which you would like us to communication with you, including how you receive details of latest offers from us.
If you have an online account with us, the easiest way to make updates to your marketing preferences and/or change your personal details is to log onto your account. You can also click the ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù link on any online newsletters you receive or contact customer support team at

Be aware that if you unsubscribe from our marketing communications we may be unable to notify you of tailored services or offer to meet your needs. If you unsubscribe from marketing communications from us, you will still receive transactional and service messages from us regarding your Events and/or registrations.
We undertake profiling, automated decisionmaking, and analytics to improve our Sites, Apps, and Solutions by providing personalized experiences, location customization, personalized help, and instructions. This means that we may automatically process personal information to evaluate certain personal aspects about you to predict your personal preferences, interests, behavior, or location. Based on our analysis, we then send or display communications or content specifically tailored to your interests and needs.
Some of the purposes for which we engage in profiling, automated decision making and analytics include:
to obtain a better understanding of what you would like to see from us and how we can continue to improve our services for you;
to personalize the service and offers you receive from us;
to provide you with tailored content online and optimize your experience of our Sites;
to provide you with tailored advertisements on other websites you visit and social media and digital platforms;
to share marketing material we believe may be of interest to you, including from other ACTIVE entities and our third party partners;
to help us operate our services more efficiently; and
to authenticate log-ins on our Sites and detect and prevent fraud.
When required under applicable privacy laws, prior to using automated decision making or profiling for a legitimate interest, we will take steps to ensure that our legitimate interest is not overridden by your own interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. ¬†We may also provide you with means to opt out of the use of your personal information for these purposes and opt out of the sharing your personal information with third parties for their own business purposes.
You can learn more about such rights in the ‚ÄúYour Legal Rights‚Äù section of this Notice.
