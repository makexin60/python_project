PRIVACY POLICY FOR SECRET BROWSER

Updated May 25, 2018

This privacy policy has been updated and simplified for transparency and in a language you can understand.


TOO LONG; DIDN'T READ?

The long and short of this policy is pretty simple. Secret Browser doesn't want your data and doesn't ask for it. However, since advertising is used in the app, some information may be passed to those third parties so they can show you relevant ads. Keep reading for more and for some opt-out options.


WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES SECRET BROWSER COLLECT?

Secret Browser has never required or desired your personal data. This will continue on in greater effect after GDPR becomes active on May 25, 2018. There is no registration required or available for Secret Browser aside from downloading the application from the App Store. Secret Browser does not require (or want) your precise location data but websites your visit may request it. You are free to decline these requests or disable them completely in the Settings application under Privacy, Location Services.


WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTIES?

Third party anonymous analytics and crash reporting was included with Secret Browser until version 3.8.0 via Firebase. It has been removed but some anonymous analytics and crash reporting data could be sent via Apple's built in tools if you allow analytics data to be sent to developers. You can change this option via the Settings application of your iOS device under Privacy.

Advertising is provided by the following companies. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, OS version, time and date, subject of advertisements tapped) while using Secret Browser in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit http://optout.networkadvertising.org or by turning on the "Limit Ad Tracking" option via the Settings application under Privacy.

Secret Browser is a full mobile web browser. Data that is transmitted to other servers/websites while browsing can NOT be hidden from these servers and any information you provide to them would be subject to the privacy policy of that website. While the application will make every attempt to delete all history, cache, cookies and localstorage on exit, an application crash or error could prevent this.


HOW CAN I CONTROL THIS DATA?

You can use Apple's built in Settings application to opt-out of analytics data as well as "Limit Ad Tracking". Both options are located under Privacy in the Settings application. Limiting ad tracking will not disable ads entirely, but you will see ads that are less relevant and non-personalized.

You also have the option of purchasing Pro Mode which will disable in-app advertising. Advertisments found on websites will not be disabled with this option.


DATA CONTROLLER

Secret Browser is a data controller while the advertising companies listed above act as data processors as defined by the GDPR.


UPDATES

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
