Ordering and Secure Payment
7.1 : Order
Those residing in the Channel Islands, or with a BFPO adress or PO Box are not able to order on SPARTOO.CO.UK.
The customer validates their order as follows. The validation entails the acceptance of the present terms and conditions of sale on SPARTOO.CO.UK and
of our Partners where there are one or more partner products.
The customer interested in an article visible on the site SPARTOO.CO.UK follows the below process in placing their order.
-	Choose the size and colour
-	In the basket, verify the order details (colour, quantity, size, price, etc…) with the posibility to modify, to add and delete articles.
-	During the first order, complete the customer account registration form with a password.
-	If the customer is benefitting from a special offer
(excludes Partner Products)
,  previously knowing the relevant code that is applied to the relevant field.
-	Choose the payment method, the delivery type and the delivery address.
-	Once validated, validation is definitive and irreversible as follows. All orders validated lead to a payment obligation.
- An email of confirmation of your order is sent as final sale proof after the receipt of the full amount (which is not a deposit payment). The Products are reserved for 7 days.
Any validated order results in a payment obligation.
The transfer of ownership of the products sold by SPARTOO.CO.UK in favor of the Customer, will occur only after full and proper payment by the latter, and this whatever the delivery date of the products. The retention of title clause does not prevent the risk of loss or deterioration of the goods to be borne by the Customer as soon as it is delivered at home or withdrawn in relay.
It is the Customer's responsibility to verify the accuracy of the order and to report any errors immediately.
7.2 : Payment
Payment by credit or debit card
The Customer shall provide the number of his / her bank card associated with the expiry date and the security code.
Finally, he validates his order by clicking on the "Confirm" button. In order to secure the payment, in some cases confirmation of the payment is made only after entering a 3D-Secure code provided by the bank. By checking the Remember box, the Customer agrees that the credit card number associated with the expiry date will be retained for future purchases.
Paypal
To any holder of a PayPal account, the payment is done online, by this account, simply stating the email address and PayPal password.
Thus, the Client's financial information is never communicated to SPARTOO.CO.UK. PayPal encrypts and protects the card number once and for all.
Payment in 3 instalments
Customer can opt to pay in 3 instalment with credit card. This payment method is available for orders over £50. One third of the purchase amount is debited immediately, the second third one month after purchase and the final third instalment 2 months after purchase. There is an additional charge of £5 when using this payment method.
Klarna
Payment can be made by Klarna. Klarna is a service provider offering customers a credit service for their purchases. Klarna offers payment in three instalments free of charge.
This payment method allows customers to spread the payment of their purchases over 3 instalments. Payments are automatically debited from the customer's registered debit/credit card until the order has been paid in full. The first payment will be taken when the order is placed. The other two payments will be taken every 30 days, once the first payment has been made.
If the Customer makes a return within 14 days of purchase, the first payment will be refunded and the next two payments will be cancelled.
This payment method is only available online and for orders of a minimum of €35 and a maximum of €1,500.
Once the Klarna payment method has been selected, a direct debit schedule will appear. The Customer must then accept Klarna's general terms and conditions of use, privacy notice and cookie use policy.
The Customer must then confirm their telephone number. A verification code will be sent to this number. The Customer must enter the verification code in the box provided for this purpose. The Customer must then confirm their e-mail address and complete the information requested in order to create a Klarna account.

7.5 : Security of payments
In order to ensure security of payments, the SPARTOO.CO.UK website uses a secure payment service. This service integrates the SSL security standard.

When the order is validated, the payment request is directed in real time to the secure remote payment manager. The latter sends an authorization request to the bank card network. The telepayment manager issues an electronic certification, which will be proof of the amount and date of the transaction.
