, or opt to not consent whenever requested by us through our Properties (the websites or applications owned by Medical Joyworks).
Consent will be requested from you at any of the following times:
when you begin using any of our Properties for the first time,
when the purpose for collecting and further processing your personal data has changed from its original intent in any way, or

your favorite cases or scenarios, and
your game play scores.
We also store Facebook and Google Plus public profiles when you choose to authenticate yourself for the purposes of posting comments in our Properties (whenever the feature exists and is available), or for saving your personal data. In this instance, your previous gaming results (when applicable) are stored as well.
Any comments you post on our Properties are also collected. These identify your name, your profession, and your specialty, but no other personal details.
We also store a record of your visits in our server logs. These server logs typically include:
your web request,

browser language, and
the date and time of your request.
Personal data we may receive about you from Third Parties during a product or a service provision event
In addition to the information you provide us with, we may also receive information about you from our clients. This typically occurs when the client has a contractual relationship with you, be it for employment or educational purposes.
Some of our products and services may involve you as an institutional administrator providing details of other people. If you do provide details of other people to us, you should first inform them that you will be disclosing their information to us and ensure you have their informed consent to allow you to disclose their information to us.
In the event that we have contacted you as a result of a request to provide feedback as service provision, we can confirm that the data you provide will be used according to this Privacy Policy.

any other important information related to Medical Joyworks or its Properties.
Medical Joyworks agrees not to spam you or disclose your email address to third parties without your consent.
Specialty, Profession and Place of Work
Medical Joyworks’s Properties are free services supported by advertising. Therefore, with your consent, Medical Joyworks anonymizes your specialty, profession, and place of work, and discloses and/or transmits these anonymized data to our advertising platform partners.
By anonymization of data, we mean an internal process by which user data is collected in a way that no personally identifiable information can be used to trace its source so that the people whom it describes can remain anonymous.
With your consent, Medical Joyworks also uses your specialty, profession, and place of work for analysis, to better determine what products, services and features we can offer you now and in the future.

Medical Joyworks agrees not to disclose your Facebook, Google Plus, or other Social Media Login information to third parties without your consent.
Comments
You may choose to post comments on our Properties, wherever the feature allowing for posting of comments exists. When this is the case, you will have to consent that the comments you post on the Properties will be transmitted to Medical Joyworks’s servers and distributed to other users on the Properties.
With your consent, your comments will identify your name, your profession, and your specialty, but no other personal details.

This mobile token is created and managed by your mobile device’s operating system; and processed by a specialist third party provider.
Medical Joyworks will not collect or transmit any other personal information from the devices you use to access the Properties without your consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that Medical Joyworks may disclose your information, including, but not limited to, your name, email, or Facebook or Google Plus information, to a third party if Medical Joyworks believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, to protect the rights or property of Medical Joyworks or others, or as otherwise described in the Privacy Policy.
