Last Updated: March 2021
This Privacy Policy governs the ways Cedar Electronics Corporations, its subsidiaries - including, Cobra Electronics Corporation and Escort, Inc. - and affiliates (“Cedar”, “we” or “us”)collects, stores, uses, shares and protects your information on the Site.  The Site is defined as the COBRA.COM website, the ESCORTRADAR.COM website, the DRIVE SMARTER mobile app, the iRadar mobile app, the Drive-HD app.  When you access, browse or use the Site, information will be collected, transferred, processed, stored, and/or disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  You should read this Privacy Policy in full.  By accessing, browsing, or using the Site, including without limitation purchasing Products via the Site, you acknowledge to have read and understood the information pertaining to the collection, transfer, use, processing and storage of your information, including personal data, as described in this Privacy Policy.
Any capitalized terms not defined herein have such definitions as set forth in the Terms of Use (“Agreement”), also posted on the Site. This Privacy Policy is incorporated in the Agreement as if this Privacy Policy was fully set forth therein. We reserve the right to modify the terms, conditions and notices under this Privacy Policy from time to time.  You should review these terms periodically to understand the terms that govern your use of the Site.   Where such changes to this Privacy Policy are substantial, we will also notify you by other means prior to the changes taking effect, such as by sending you an email notification. By continuing to use our Site thirty days after such revisions are in effect, you will be deemed to accept and agree to the revisions and to abide by them.
Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of your information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information.  Your non-termination or continued use of the Site after changes are posted or in accordance with the notice period stated if notified to you, constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as modified by the posted changes.

If you browse the Site, you may generally do so anonymously without providing any personal data. However, there are cases in which we may ask you for personal data. Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, this means a human being. Anonymous data, where you cannot find out who the data relates to, is not personal data.
When you place an order for a product, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This personal data is required so that we can process and fulfill your order, send an order or shipping confirmation, as well as notify you of your order status.
All internet transactions with Cedar are performed on a secure server that encrypts your credit card information to ensure it is not read by unauthorized third parties.
We may collect anonymized details about your use of the Site for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. Aggregated data (your data combined with other people’s data) may come from your personal data, but, if it does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity, it is not considered personal data. For example, we may combine and analyze your use of the Site to work out the number of users accessing a specific website feature.

https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy

Orders and Payment Processing
. If you purchase Products from us, we request certain personally identifiable data from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and address) and, where applicable, financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date, and validation number). We use this information for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we may use this information to contact you.
We use a third party service provider (currently Shopify) to process credit card transactions.  The credit card information that you provide is encrypted and transmitted directly to Shopify.  We do not store your credit card information and do not control and are not responsible for Shopify or their collection or use of your information.  If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.  All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.  PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

Transfer, processing and storage of Personal DATA
As a global organization with affiliated entities located inside and outside of the EU/EEA and business processes in operation across borders, we may transfer your personal data to Cedar’s headquarters in the Unites States, Illinois, to any Cedar affiliate entity worldwide or to third-party business partners, providers, vendors, or contractors, that are located inside or outside of the EU/EEA, for purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including for the purpose of data processing or storage on behalf and under the control of Cedar.
Cedar will perform any cross-borders transfer in compliance with applicable privacy and data protection regulations, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of personal data (“GDPR”). Where mandated by applicable law, to ensure that your personal data does receive an adequate level of protection, Cedar implements the appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data is treated across Cedar affiliated entities and by the aforementioned third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the applicable privacy and data protection laws. Measures consist of Standard Contractual Clauses.
THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”)
If you reside within the European Union you may be entitled to other rights under the GDPR. These rights are summarized below. We may require you to verify your identity before we respond to your requests to exercise your rights. If you are entitled to these rights, you may exercise these rights with respect to your personal data that we collect and store:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at

Access to personal DATA
You have the right to access, free of charge, obtain a paper or electronic copy, review, correct and update all your personal data stored by us, notably to confirm its accuracy. Subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, you may also oppose to or limit the processing or your personal data or request that certain of your personal data be deleted from our files.
If you reside within the EU, you may also exercise you right to portability of your personal data where the lawful basis for the processing is (i) (a) a contract or (b) your consent and (ii) by automated means. Please note that such a request could be limited to the sole personal data you provided us with or that we hold at that given time and subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures.
Cedar will make reasonable efforts to comply with the aforementioned requests, unless such requests are prohibited by law, or there is a legitimate purpose to retain your personal data, in which case we will inform you without undue delay. We reserve the right to verify your identity before any request relating to your personal data processed by us.
