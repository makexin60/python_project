How It Works
The Ground Control IoT Tech Stack
These are the building blocks of the solutions we build for customers. It starts with understanding where your assets are, and whether they’re moving around; data volumes, data security, any power constraints, and the time-criticality of the receipt of your data.
From there we can build all, or elements of, the gateway: connecting sensors, delivering edge processing, and providing the means of communicating with the satellite network. We work with multiple satellite network operators to make sure our customers get the most suitable combination of data throughput, latency, coverage and cost.
Our powerful platform
Cloudloop
delivers subscription, device and data management for customers. Everything is available as a simplified and well documented API for seamless integration with existing workflows.
