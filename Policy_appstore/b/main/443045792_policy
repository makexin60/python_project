Summary
We value your trust and respect your privacy
This document sets out our Master Privacy Policy for our products and services, and all our interactions with you. We’ve used examples in this policy to help explain some points – please remember that these examples describe common scenarios but don’t cover all situations.
This privacy policy sets out how we collect, use, share and protect your personal information. Personal information includes any information that could identify you – for example:
your name, personal and tax details, and home address
information we collect when you use our websites, social media profiles, and apps
video recordings of you when you’re in a branch, and recordings of you from phone calls with us.
Personal information is central to our business
We use it when we:
design and deliver products and services
recommend products and services that we think meet your needs
protect our customers and our business interests
comply with laws, and with our responsibilities and obligations as a financial services business.
We only use information if we’re allowed to – or if the law requires it
Whenever we work with personal information, we comply with the laws of New Zealand, including the Privacy Act 2020, and laws of other countries that apply to us. We are allowed to use personal information when:
you’ve agreed to let us use it – for example, you’ve given us a copy of your salary to confirm your income so that we can decide if we offer you a loan
we fulfil a contract, and to give you the products or services you’ve asked for
we run and develop our businesses – for example, to understand how customers use our products and services
we meet our legal obligations – for example, to comply with anti-fraud and anti-money laundering laws.
You have rights to access your personal information
We respect the trust you give us to hold your personal information because we know that your information – and your privacy – are important. For more information on your rights, including how to make a request to access or correct your personal information, read ‘
You have the right to request your personal information
’.
Get in touch if you have any questions or complaints
We want to be open, honest and transparent about how we work with personal information. If you have any questions, please see ‘
How to get in touch with us

We use cookies and other software to collect information
You can find out more about how we use cookies in our
cookies policy
.
We aren’t responsible for privacy policies on third-party apps and websites
Sometimes our apps and websites have links to third-party apps and websites. We take care when we choose websites we link to, but we aren’t responsible for their content, accuracy, or privacy practices.
When we work with third parties or use their information
We collect personal information about you from third parties, so we can offer you products or services you’ve applied for and run our business efficiently.
When you apply for a product or service
You ask a third party – a legal or financial adviser, a surveyor or valuer – to give us information.
You agree that we can ask health service providers or doctors for information about you when you apply for particular products or services.
You agree that we can check if a product or service is right for you – this may mean we run a credit check on you with a credit reporting agency, or check employment references you’ve given us.
When we work with third parties to offer you products or services
We work with third parties to offer you products or services – for example, brokers, credit card providers, or our related companies.
They introduce you to us so we can offer you products and services – for example, loyalty programs, a car dealership that helps arrange loans, or a financial services company.
We work with BNZ Investment Services Limited and the FirstCape Group to provide and administer wealth and KiwiSaver products.
When we work with third parties to help run our businesses
They give us legal, financial or marketing advice, or advice to help us run our business. This can include transactional information like international payments, and details of repayments.
They help us detect and prevent fraud, scams and other financial crime. For example, the Financial Crime Prevention Network.
They help us comply with laws. For example, government bodies like Inland Revenue or the police.
They are publicly available sources – for example, news articles and social media content, and public or government registers.
They help us or a third party get in touch with you in an emergency.
You can decide not to provide your information, but it will limit what we can do for you
You can choose not to give us some of your personal information. However, if you don’t, we may not be able to:
offer you the products or services that you want
manage your products or services
respond to or help with your questions
confirm your identity or protect you against fraud.
4. How we use personal information
We use your personal information when you apply for our products and services, when you’re a customer, and when you use our free products and services. We also use this information to manage our business efficiently and develop new products.
When you apply for a product or service
We’ll use your personal information to confirm your identity, process your application, and tell you if we can or can’t offer you a product or service. We may also use the information to confirm you can act on behalf of another customer.
When you apply for a product or service, we have to decide if it’s right for you. We’ll use your personal information to:
run checks on your credit history
decide if you meet the conditions we set for a product or service
decide if we’ll need a guarantor or security
offer you the right products and services to help you achieve your goals.
When you use any of our products and services
When you use our products and services, including the free ones, we’ll use your personal information to communicate with you about those products and services. We’ll keep a record of how we can contact you – for example, by email, phone, or text message.
Personal information helps us do what you ask us to
We use personal information to do the things you expect us to do when you sign up for a product or service. This includes:
managing our day-to-day business and keeping business records
making and managing payments
assisting with insurance claims
preparing and sending statements that set out fees, charges and interest
helping with KiwiSaver services
working with other companies to deliver or improve our products or services and communications.
We may also use your information to decide when to:
suggest better ways to use our products and services, or tell you about new features
tell you about a product or service we think will meet your needs
inform you when your accounts may require attention or action
support you when you are experiencing financial difficulty.
We may also use your information to do things that are out of the everyday, like help:
keep people safe – for example, to find out if our customers are experiencing financial abuse
track payments and transactions – for example, locating a payment made to an incorrect bank account.
When we market products or services to you or provide personalised recommendations
We use your personal information to decide what marketing or personalised information to send you. We may use your information to deliver marketing that is relevant to your interests, or recommendations based on products or services you use. We may partner with third parties to collect information about how you use our websites and apps. This helps to improve the relevance of the marketing you see.
Marketing messages we send you may include news about products or services we believe will be relevant to you.
You can opt out of our marketing communications
If you ask us not to send you any email marketing materials or research surveys, we’ll make that change in our systems as soon as we can. You can opt out of our email marketing communications by:
clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ links when you get marketing emails
calling our contact centre on
0800 275 269
going into any of our
branches
.
If you do opt out, we still have to send you operational communications. These may include messages that:
are about your products or services – for example, we’ll tell you when a term deposit is about to come to an end
we have to send to comply with New Zealand laws – for example, to tell you about an interest rate change on your home loan.
When we manage our business
We use your information to run our day-to-day operations.
Personal information helps us run our business efficiently
We use personal information to do the kind of things most companies do, for example:
preparing management reports and business plans
recovering money that customers owe us.
We also do things that financial services companies need to do, for example:
managing financial and other risks for our business and our customers
monitoring our systems for, and helping to protect our customers against, fraud or financial crime
planning, building and monitoring systems and processes for lending money.
Personal information helps us improve our offers and our customer service
We constantly look for ways to improve our products or services, and our standard of customer service. We use personal information to help us:
find ways to improve customer service – for example, we may use recorded calls for staff training and quality improvement
add new features to or improve our products or services, and develop new products or services
help resolve any queries you may have about your interactions with us, including complaints
make sure we can correct any errors in the services you have received, such as contacting you to arrange refunds
come up with ideas on ways to help people manage their money.
Personal information helps us understand how you interact with us
We use personal information to perform analytics activities. We use analytics tools to measure activity on our website and for our products and services. We then combine that information with other data. This helps us:
identify and understand trends about how customers interact with our products, services, and platforms
improve our products and services, and create new ones that fit our customers’ needs better
analyse and understand risks more effectively.
When we must comply with our legal obligations
We have to comply with several New Zealand laws and some overseas laws. We may have to use personal information to comply with our obligations:
to agencies that prevent or investigate unlawful activities like fraud, money laundering or other illegal activities
to regulatory or government bodies like Inland Revenue and the police
under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 and the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003.
5. When we share personal information, and who we share it with
We share information with our related companies and other third parties. We only share personal information when we’re allowed to under New Zealand or international laws, or when we’re legally required to.
When we share information outside BNZ
We share personal information with third parties who aren’t our related companies when:
we do something that’s part of a product or service – for example, we make a payment you set up or send you a statement you asked for
we develop or update our systems and make changes to our products or services
you, or someone with authority over your account, says we can – for example, you may give us permission to confirm your salary with your employer, or to share your information with a credit reporting agency
we have to defend or enforce our rights – for example, to collect money owed to us
we have to comply with our legal obligations in New Zealand or overseas
we need to participate in resolving a dispute with you – for example, responding to complaints made to the Banking Ombudsman
we need to protect our business interests – for example, to help us detect or prevent fraud, scams, and other unlawful activity, and to manage our risk
we work with third parties who provide products and services to you – for example, wealth or KiwiSaver products.
Who we share your information with
We share personal information with:
our related companies
credit reporting agencies
companies we work with to offer products or services, such as BNZ Investment Services Limited, or the FirstCape Group
companies who help us deliver and manage our products or services
government, dispute resolution, and regulatory bodies
companies, individuals, and service providers you’ve given us permission to share information with
industry groups that we’re members of, for example, the Financial Crime Prevention Network and the Anti-Scam Centre
organisations and individuals that can offer specialist assistance, for example, Age Concern or a family member when we suspect a customer is the victim of elder abuse.
Some of the organisations we share information with may be overseas. These organisations may have to comply with laws that require them to disclose your personal information.
We share information with our related companies
We share and combine personal information BNZ holds with our related companies to get a better picture of your needs, to run our business, meet our obligations, and deliver products or services that require collaboration between our specialist entities.
We share information with credit reporting agencies
Credit reporting agencies may use that information to deliver a credit report (or credit score) to a company that runs a credit check on you. As a responsible lender, we participate in comprehensive credit reporting.  This means we provide credit reporting agencies with monthly updates on what credit accounts our customers have and whether they are meeting their repayments.
Credit reporting agencies have to comply with the Credit Reporting Privacy Code – you can find out more about the Code on the
Privacy Commissioner’s website
.
We share information with third parties we work with to offer products or services
We share personal information with companies we work with to offer our products or services to their customers.
We also share information with companies we agree can offer their products and services to our customers – for example BNZ Investment Services Limited and the FirstCape Group for wealth and KiwiSaver products.
We share information with third parties who help us deliver products or services
We share personal information with a range of third parties who help us deliver and manage our products or services.
These third parties include:
brokers and organisations providing financial advice services
accountants, auditors, and lawyers
companies that help us manage insurance risk, including our re-insurers and underwriters
companies and individuals who provide a service to us that requires them to process or store personal information on our behalf such as social media platforms and other digital advertisers for targeted advertising
companies and individuals who help us develop new products or services
agencies and institutions that help us manage our risk or prevent and identify fraudulent activity, for example through industry risk-sharing agreements
rating agencies who give our investment products financial ratings
companies that collect or purchase debts, or help with financial recoveries
organisations we may assign or transfer our rights or obligations to – for example, rights in relation to home loans.
We also share your information with anyone who you have told us may act as a guarantor for you, or is one of your guarantors.
We share information with government, dispute resolution, and regulatory bodies
We share information with government and regulatory bodies for two reasons:
the law requires us to tell them – for example, when a customer gives us fraudulent information, or commits – or tries to commit – an offence
the law requires us to share information with authorities like Inland Revenue, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, or the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. These authorities may share this information with other parties.
We also share information with dispute resolution bodies like the Banking Ombudsman when asked to respond to any complaints they receive from our customers.
We share information with industry groups that we’re members of, such as the Financial Crime Prevention Network, to help us detect and prevent fraud, scams, and unlawful activity.
We share information with companies, individuals, and service providers when you’ve given us permission.
We’ll share information with companies when you ask us to.
And you may give us permission to share your information with others – for example:
an employer who can confirm your salary
third parties who can confirm information you’ve given us, or give us information we need – for example, real estate agents, valuers, insurers, underwriters, and brokers
organisations or individuals that provide budgeting services
doctors or health professionals who can confirm information you’ve given us
service providers you use and ask us to share your information with, such as accounting platforms you use.
6. How we protect personal information
Your privacy is important to us. We take protecting your personal information seriously.
Where and how we store your personal information
We store most of our personal information in New Zealand or in Australia.
We store personal information electronically and physically. We store electronic information in facilities in New Zealand and overseas:
that we manage
that are managed by third parties (including cloud storage facilities).
How we protect your information
We comply with international laws that set out how to protect both BNZ and customer information.
We protect your information in a range of ways.
We have a cybersecurity team that looks after and protects your information. This team helps prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity events and incidents.
We train all our customer-facing staff on privacy and security, and make sure they get regular updates.
We have a team that checks on third parties we work with when we share personal information to make sure they work to agreed standards.
How we protect your information when we transfer it outside BNZ
When we transfer your information outside BNZ, it may be to a company in New Zealand or overseas. Our contract with the company will require the company to protect your personal information.
We’ll use reasonable security safeguards, like file encryption, to protect your personal information.
What we do if a privacy breach occurs
If we believe that a privacy breach has occurred, we’ll identify the issue and take steps to minimise any harm.
If we believe the breach has caused, or is likely to cause serious harm, we’ll contact the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. We may also contact customers who may be affected by the breach.
If you believe a privacy breach has occurred, please
contact us
as soon as possible.
How long we keep your information for
We’re required to hold personal information by the Companies Act 1993, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Act 2009, the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 1996, and other New Zealand and international laws.
We usually have to hold personal information for at least seven years. But we keep certain types of information for longer, even if you’re no longer a customer, for example, superannuation records.
7. You have the right to access and correct personal information
You, or someone you give authority to, has the right to request access to or correct your personal information.
You can request information about someone else if you have legal authority
You can request to access or correct someone else’s information if you have legal authority – for example, if you have a power of attorney.
You can access or correct certain information online, by phone, or in a branch
In most cases you can access or correct your information yourself and you won’t need to submit a request. The fastest way for you to access or correct your everyday information is to use internet banking. Or you can call us, or come into a branch, and we’ll do it for you.
Everyday requests for information are for things like:
balances and transaction history, tax or bank statements, and KiwiSaver information
viewing or confirming product details like home loans and interest rates
updates to personal information like an email, postal address or phone number.
If the information you want is not available using everyday channels, for example, the information is unusual, complex or sensitive, you may need to make a request for your personal information so we can gather it for you.
Find out how to make a request to access or correct your personal information
If you don’t have internet access, or you want to talk to us about how to access or correct your information, call us on
0800 275 269
or
go into a branch
.
Keeping you updated if you make a request
We’ll normally get back to you with a response within 20 working days. We may take longer in certain situations. We will keep you up to date throughout the process.
Please tell us if your request is urgent, and why, and we’ll take this into account.
We don’t normally charge a fee to complete personal information requests. If we are going to charge a fee, we’ll talk to you before we go ahead.
8. Your rights if you live outside New Zealand
If you live overseas, New Zealand privacy laws and this privacy policy still apply to your personal information.
International privacy laws may also apply to you
If you reside outside of New Zealand, other international privacy or data protection laws may apply to you – for example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). These international laws may set out additional rights, such as the right to erasure, restriction of processing, data portability or the right to have human intervention in automated decision-making.
If you move back to New Zealand, the New Zealand privacy laws will apply.
How to make a request under another country’s privacy laws
If you think these international laws apply, please email us at
privacy@bnz.co.nz
with your request and details of where you reside.
9. How to get in touch with us
We care about your privacy and welcome your feedback.
