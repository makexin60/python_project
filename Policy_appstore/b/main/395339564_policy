Introduction
We at NCH Software are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. NCH Software has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we treat your Personal Information.
For the purposes of this statement, "Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit NCH Software's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we reserve the right to transfer that Information within NCH Software or to NCH Software's third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
NCH Software strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, NCH Software intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about website activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user.
Use the Manage Cookies link
in your browser to control cookies, including whether to accept them and how to remove them. (Note if you opt out of cookies, we will keep a cookie to record the fact you have opted out). Opting out is domain specific.
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. We pass URLs to Google for website analytics reasons. URLs may contain personal information like what terms you searched and which site you came from or the pages you visit and the programs you downloaded. We pass your search queries done on our local site search to our search provider so they can provide relevant web search results. These queries then become part of the URL which may be passed to third parties. We pass conversion events (downloads, signup, purchases and similar events) back to networks who provided the clicks from your search so we can measure the conversion rates on each of our ads.
Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.
We use cookies to track users on our website to improve our website presence and content. For example, we use the information to assist us in deciding how to order links. We also use cookies to track how our site visitors find us.

Data Collection and Storage
We will never sell your personal data.
In addition to the data policies listed in the "Cookies..." section above we keep sales logs for purchases. This data includes customer name, email address, IP address, transaction amounts, and other transactional information associated with the purchase. NCH Software does not store credit card information. The data is used by NCH Software solely for historical transaction reference for financial, technical support, or similar activities that require purchase information. NCH Software understands the value of your personal information and privacy.
If you opt-in for our version update newsletter or purchase software from us, we may send you marketing material. You will be able to unsubscribe at any time.
Your email address may be recorded by the software automatically, even if you do not opt-in. In this case we will not send you marketing material (unless you later choose to opt-in on purchase). Use of your email address will be limited to extreme cases such as notifying users of serious bugs in an application or no more than once for non-marketing product feedback requests.

Collection of Program Usage Data
Our programs may collect anonymous usage data which may be sent back to use for analysis, such as the number of times a menu or option is used within the program. In these cases, the data collected will never contain anything that can personally identify you.

Choice
You may choose whether to provide Personal Information to NCH Software. Please review the Personal Information section of the Introduction in order to make this decision. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of NCH Software's Web sites, but you may be unable to download or purchase our software. If you choose to have a relationship with us, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

Security
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within NCH Software, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. More specifically, our server uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protection by encrypting all personal information including credit card number, name and address to prevent individuals from reading this information as it travels over the Internet.

Access/Accuracy
To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, NCH Software wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. When we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting NCH Software should you need to update or correct that Information.

Third Party Services
NCH Software does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on NCH Software's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against NCH Software's policy to sell Personal Information collected online.
Some NCH Software applications make use of Google and YouTube API Services for features such as file or video sharing. If you use YouTube upload or other features you are agreeing to the YouTube terms of service. If you authorize an application to use your Google Account, the application will store an access token on your device. To invalidate this token at any time, modify the
apps with access to your account
on the Google Account Permissions page. NCH Software does not store or retain any information associated with your Google user account or data.
