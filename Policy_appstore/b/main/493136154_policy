Clear Privacy Policy
Clear collects some anonymized usage data for basic metrics that help us improve its design. Basically we track things like, how many people tap the back button vs. pinch or pull to go back, or how many people used the app today.
We do
NOT
collect your list contents or any personal or sensitive information.
As an indie team, we have no interest in the liability of holding sensitive, personal data of yours on a server. And targeted advertising would frankly destroy the kind of pristine experience Clear is beloved for.
We simply want to deliver the best listing experience and be rewarded with some patronage in the in-app shop.
Other data is tracked only on device, and purely to enable features like Clear's rewards (achievements).
We hope this covers any basic questions or concerns.
Happy listing with Clear.
