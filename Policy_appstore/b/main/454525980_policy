Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies, or if you set your browser to decline cookies, some features of our Services may not be available, work, or work as designed. You also may be able to opt out of or block tracking by interacting directly with the third parties that conduct tracking through our Services.
You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the
Network Advertising Initiative
, the
Digital Advertising Alliance
, and the European
Interactive Digital Advertising Initiative
. Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device.
Please note that opting out of advertising network services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from other companies that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences.
Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. At this time, TNR does not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.

How We Share Your Information
Service Providers
: We engage vendors to perform specific business functions on our behalf, and they may receive information about you. These vendors are obligated by contract to use information that we share only for the purpose of providing these services. The business functions our vendors support include: website, software, and data storage; content management; database management; subscription management; technical integration; marketing; analytics and site optimization; conducting customer surveys; payment processing; managing subscription-related information; billing and collection; auditing and accounting; professional services; analytics services; security; and IT.
Online Advertising Partners
: We partner with companies that assist us in advertising about our Services to others who may be interested in the Services. We also partner with other companies who use cookies to display interest-based advertising to you on our Services.
Other Similar Organizations
: We share subscriber addresses with other organizations that may be interested in advertising to our subscribers.
Social Media Platforms
: Where you choose to interact with us through social media, your interaction with these programs typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through digital cookies it places on your device and other tracking mechanisms. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its digital cookies even when you do not interact with its application. Please visit the third parties’ respective privacy policies to better understand their data-collection practices and controls they make available to you.
Government Entities
: We may also share data when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so to respond to lawful subpoenas, warrants, court orders, or other regulatory or law enforcement requests, or where necessary to protect our property or rights or the safety of our employees, our customers, or other individuals.
Potential Purchasers of our Business
: We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Services. We may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers some or all information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of business, change in ownership control, or financing transaction. We cannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Policy.
Together and with the information provided from our Services, we may combine other information we obtain from our business records. Additionally, information collected about you from a particular browser or device may be linked to information collected from another computer or device that we believe relates to you.
We may also disclose information to other entities who are not listed here when required by law or to protect our Company or other persons, as described in our Privacy Policy.
Children’s Information
Our Services are intended for users over the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected information from anyone younger than the age of 13, we will delete that information.
How We Secure the Information We Collect From or About You
TNR has technical and organizational security measures in place, including firewalls, to protect the information under our control from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures do not guarantee prevention of loss, misuse, or alteration of information, however, so while we strive to protect your information, TNR cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We comply with generally accepted industry standards in collecting and processing credit card information. However, TNR does not guarantee the safety of credit card information over the internet.
Users Outside the United States
If you use our Services outside the United States, you understand that we collect, process, and store your information in the United States. The laws in the United States regarding personal information may be different from the laws of your jurisdiction. Any such transfers will comply with safeguards as required by relevant law.
Your California Privacy Rights
Residents of California have the right to request information regarding companies to whom the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the companies’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please email
privacy@tnr.com
or write to us at 1 Union Square West, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10003.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of “personal information,” as well as rights to know or access, correct, delete, and limit disclosure of personal information. The CCPA defines “personal information” as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a specific federal privacy law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
You have the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights. To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below.
Right to Information Regarding Categories of Personal Information Collected, Sold, Shared, and Disclosed
You have the right to receive notice of the categories of personal information we collect, and the purposes for which we use personal information. You also have the right to know about the sources of the personal information; whether we disclose, sell, or share that information to service providers or third parties, respectively; and the criteria we use to determine the retention period for such information. The categories we use in the table below to describe personal information are those enumerated in the CCPA. The table also summarizes the categories of “sensitive” personal information that we collect, the purposes for which such information is used, and whether we sell or share such information.
Entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes are service providers, which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf. Service providers are restricted from using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of service providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described above in the section titled “How We Share Your Information.”
Entities to whom we “sell” or with whom we “share” information are third parties. Under the CCPA, a business “sells” personal information when it discloses it to a company for monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because the purpose for its sharing of personal information is not for an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because its contract does not restrict it from using personal information for other purposes. A business “shares” personal information when it discloses personal information to a company for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
We collect this personal information from the sources described in the Information We Collect section above for the purposes described in the How We Use Your Information section above.

Personal information may be disclosed in additional, more limited circumstances, as described in How We Share Your Information above.
We determine the retention period for each of the categories of personal information listed above based on (1) the length of time we need to retain the information to achieve the business or commercial purpose for which it was obtained, (2) any legal or regulatory requirements applicable to such information, (3) internal operational needs, and (4) any need for the information based on any actual or anticipated investigation or litigation.
Right to Know, Request Access, Correction, or Deletion
You have the right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we sell, share, or disclose it. You also have the right to request in certain circumstances that we correct personal information that we have collected about you and to delete personal information that we have collected directly from you. You may submit such a request as described below. To protect our customers’ personal information, we will verify your identity before we act on your request.
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information to Third Parties
You have the right to opt out of any sale or sharing of your personal information to third parties. To exercise this right, please visit our “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
” page, email us at
privacy@tnr.com
, or call us at 1-800-827-1289. Please note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing of personal information with service providers, who are parties we engage to perform a function on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use the personal information only for that function.
Right to Limit the Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information
You have the right to limit our use of your sensitive personal information if we use such information to infer characteristics about you. Your right to limit our use of such information is subject to exception.
How to Submit a Request
You may submit a request to exercise your rights through one of two means:
By filling out a Consumer Data Request Form available
