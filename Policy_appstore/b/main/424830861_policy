Ynet Sites provide links to various pages on the Internet. Such links may direct you to various contents on the Internet. Most of the contents are not published by Yedioth Internet or on its behalf, and Yedioth Internet does not control or supervise such contents. The fact that Ynet Sites contain links to such contents does not indicate that Yedioth Internet consents to such contents and does not provide any guarantee of their authenticity, correctness and lawfulness and the practices of the owners of such contents on privacy matters and in any other aspect related to their operation. You may find that such contents do not correspond to your needs or that you object to their content or consider them to be aggravating, annoying, improper, illegal or immoral. Yedioth Internet is not responsible for the contents to which the links lead and is not responsible for any consequence resulting from your use thereof or reliance thereon.
Yedioth Internet does not warrant that the links in Ynet Sites will function properly and lead you to an active website. Yedioth Internet may remove links from Ynet Sites or refrain from adding new links, at its sole discretion.
The Ynet online search engine is managed and operated by a third party, reflecting the personal discretion of its editors and/or the algorithm at the basis of its operation. Consequently, the search results and/or recommendations pertaining to the results according to the search values you enter should not be seen as legally binding and should not be considered objective as to an evaluation of the suitability of the search results to the values you entered and/or to your subjective goals, and the inclusion of such a search engine on Ynet is in no way a recommendation to rely on the search results one way or another. The order in which the search results are listed in the index is not indicative of their nature or importance, and Yedioth Internet has no control over the order of their appearance. The search engine algorithm, which determines the results’ order of appearance, may do so also on the basis of commercial considerations (but results so promoted will be identified appropriately). The contents and nature of websites often change. Therefore, the search results presented to you may be incomplete, inaccurate and/or not up-to-date.
Without derogating from the aforesaid, and subject to the provisions hereof, I confirm that the details I have provided are true and accurate, that the intellectual property rights, including the copyright of the information I am submitting to Yedioth Internet through this form, are my exclusive property or the property of a party represented by me. I understand that sending the information to Yedioth Internet constitutes a free, worldwide and perpetual license to publish the information wherever and whenever Yedioth Internet sees fit, and I grant Yedioth Internet permission to use the information as it sees fit, including handing it over to third parties. I understand and agree I am not entitled to any compensation, financial or otherwise, for providing this information, and that Yedioth Internet is not obligated to publish my name as the source for the information (apart from giving credit for a photo or work of art). I confirm my agreement for investigation of the information, and I understand that the editorial staff is not obligated to publish it. I further confirm that I have given my consent to changes and to editing the information. If I sign on behalf of an organization, I declare that I am authorized to approve and commit on behalf of that organization.

Yedioth Internet does not claim title to contents you post on Ynet Sites. However, by providing contents for publication on Ynet Sites you confirm that you hold all the rights to the contents and that you are entitled to post them. If you are not the author or the right-holder of the contents you provide for publication, then you represent that you are duly authorized by the right-holder to post the contents on Ynet Sites and to grant rights of use as specified below.
By providing contents for publication you grant Yedioth Internet a free, worldwide and perpetual license to copy, duplicate, distribute, market, make available to the public, arrange, edit, translate and otherwise use such contents, at its discretion, on Ynet Sites, in printed material, including newspapers, magazines, periodicals, books etc., on digital media, including other websites, in digital archives and in services provided on telecommunication networks, including wired, wireless, cellular, cable and satellite communications.

We reiterate that correct professional advice depends on the exact circumstances of each and every case. The Contents on Ynet Sites are not a substitute for such advice. This is true especially and in particular in regards to Contents posted in communities and discussion groups (forums), including contents posted by the administrators of the communities and discussion groups. Such Contents are not a substitute for professional counsel, when needed (e.g. a response posted by a medical specialist to a question raised in the framework of a discussion group is not a substitute for seeking medical counsel or care, as the case may be). Such Contents may sometimes reflect a certain approach or personal opinion of the writer. Therefore, they should be treated with the necessary caution. If you decide to rely on Contents posted on Ynet Sites or to act upon them, you bear full and sole responsibility for your actions and for the resultant consequences.
Yedioth Internet does not undertake that Ynet Sites services shall operate without disruption or interruption or be provided regularly, function safely and without error, or be immune to unauthorized access to Yedioth Internet’s computers or to damage, malfunctions, failures and defects—in hardware, software, communication lines and systems, at Yedioth Internet or at any of its providers.

Such alterations shall be performed, among others things, while taking into account the dynamic nature of the Internet and the technological and other changes which may occur from time to time. By their very nature, such changes may entail malfunctions and/or may initially cause inconvenience, etc. You will have no claim, suit and/or demand against Yedioth Internet as a result of the execution of such changes and/or of malfunctions deriving from their execution.
