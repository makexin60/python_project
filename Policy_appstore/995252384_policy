How do we use Artificial Intelligence?
We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services. Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing. The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently. For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively. We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists. To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.

Data Sharing
What are the purposes for sharing my data?
Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:
Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws. For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. This is not unique to
BetterHelp
and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services. These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality. For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to
BetterHelp
's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with
Service Providers
12
that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform. Examples include:
Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way. Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy. Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it  and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way. Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them. For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.  If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them. We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization. In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so. If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to
"Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")"
, we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to
Process
1
data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions. This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to
"Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")"
information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes. For more information about your specific settings, see
here
. To learn more, see section:
"Are you using my data for advertising?"
How do you use my data to comply with the law?
When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies. This is not unique to
BetterHelp
and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities. Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment. You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.
Do you sell my data?
We aren't paid by anyone for any data. However, in California, the laws define “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value. If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a “sale” of personal information under that specific California law. For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the
additional notice for California residents
.
Are you using my data for advertising?
In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some
Third Party
2
web properties such as Third Party websites and apps. In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.
Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some
Visitor Data
, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes. As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.
If you use the App and have “Allowed” app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective. This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads. If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to “
Cookie Settings
” in the App and opt out of advertising. For IOS users, you can “Ask App Not to Track” when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking). From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.
Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in “retargeting” advertising. Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.
To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers. Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.
As described further above at
SECTION 2 Data Sharing
, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns. Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed
here
), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it  and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
For additional information regarding Third Parties that
BetterHelp
may share data with, please reference our
Third Party Partners Disclosure List

Data Retention, Erasure, and Exporting
How long do you retain my data and how do I request data erasure?
BetterHelp
is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements.
Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive. These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information. Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function.
In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below,
BetterHelp
maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data.
The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access. In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See
"What is this Privacy Policy"
) so that it is no longer accessible by anyone.
Retention Policy
BetterHelp
’s data retention policies are based upon what data is being
Processed

, whether or not the Member has participated in therapy, and if the Member proactively requested data erasure or if the erasure is triggered due to Platform inactivity.

Exercising Your Data Protection Rights:
As stated, you have certain rights under data protection laws, including the right to request that we erase personal data we hold about you, and the right to request a copy of it. The following sections describe how you can exercise those rights.
Requesting Data Erasure:
To request data erasure, please log in to your account and go to Menu > My Account (or Account Settings) > My Personal Information, where you will see a link to request complete erasure of your account. Click that and follow the instructions to begin the data erasure process. You will receive a confirmation email from us within 24 hours of your request.
If you do not have access to your account or are having trouble with this method, you can directly contact Member Success at
contact@
betterhelp.com
and they will assist you with the process.  Additionally, if, under applicable data protection laws, you have the right to request that data we hold about you be edited or rectified, you may make this request by contacting Member Success. You can expect to receive an email confirming receipt of your request within 24 hours.
Additionally you can visit our opt out instructions page to request erasure or to opt out of previous settings you have opted into.
You may reach out to us at
DPO@
betterhelp.com
if you need additional help. We will only comply with a request for the erasure of your data if we can verify your identity. There is usually no charge. In exceptional circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee after discussing the fee with you.
If you reach out to either Member Success or
DPO@
betterhelp.com
, we have specific requirements that must be met in order for us to process your data erasure request.
Requirements:
Only you or your authorized representative may make a request on your behalf. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child depending on the applicable laws.
You must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify your identity or status as an authorized representative.
You must provide details that allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.
In some circumstances, legal or regulatory requirements limit our ability to honor erasure requests. As such, we may decline requests for erasure if the information is:
Subject to a litigation hold or legal request to preserve it.
Necessary to comply with laws and regulations and to maintain business integrity.
Clinical Health Record (described above) falls under this exemption.
Additionally, compliance obligations require us to retain records documenting certain interactions you have with us related to your Membership. As such, we cannot honor erasure requests for information contained in records of:
Communications about complaints and erasure or access requests.
Disclosures of personal data to Third Parties.
If we don’t intend to comply with a request, then we will tell you why this is the case, and outline how we weighed your rights and freedoms against our legal obligations. In such instances, any information retained will only be used for purposes contemplated under the legally recognized exemption.
Requesting a copy of my data
To receive a summary copy of your data, please log in to your account and go to Menu > My Account (or Account settings) > My Personal information, where you will see an option to request a copy of your data. The data you will receive as part of this request includes the contact information that you input on the site, questionnaire answers, worksheet entries, emergency contact information, messages you sent to your Therapist, journal entries that you created, and other personal information.
Additional data which we maintain includes email interactions with our help desk, which is stored on your email system. You may also request this information by writing to
DPO@
betterhelp.com
. As with data erasure, we are not always able to respect your request for data access. For more information on why this may be and how the situation will be handled, please reference the previous section.
BetterHelp Business Retention and Erasure
BetterHelp Business: Retention Policy
We automatically delete
BetterHelp Business Data
about an individual three years after either the end of their organization’s relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed. (e.g., an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product).
BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure…
To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the "Update Email Preferences" link located in the footer of the
BetterHelp Business webpage
, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send. On that linked webpage, please check the box next to "Delete my Data."
Note:
BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data. As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories.
For example, an Account Administrator who also uses BetterHelp as a Member would need to follow the process described in “Requesting Data Erasure…” to request the erasure of their Member data, and the process described in "BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure" to request the erasure of their BetterHelp Business Data.

Security and Anonymity
How do you keep my data secure?
We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure. Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind. Our Platform is certified by
HITRUST
- one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.
BetterHelp
has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data. We have an Information Security team who test internal security at
BetterHelp
to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks. We have numerous robust security practices such as:
All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.
Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.
Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.
Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.
We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans. For example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.
For your own security, keep the following in mind:
Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking. We will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication. You should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.
External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service. We do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.
Can I sign up for
BetterHelp
and remain anonymous?
When you sign up for an account on
BetterHelp
, we do not ask you for your full name. You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system. You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you. You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization’s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances. When you decide to start the therapy process, we’ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger. Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.
Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet. Read more about what data we

our opt-out instructions page
to opt-out of tracking via cookies or web beacons, or for instructions on how to remove previously set cookies.
Who can see the interactions I have with my Therapist?
You and your Therapist are able to see the messages you send, the worksheets you submit. Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the
BetterHelp
Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes. For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any
Third Party
2
, and your live sessions are not recorded. We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party.
How do you treat data from children?
We don’t knowingly collect or solicit any data or information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly allow such persons to become our users. The Platform is not directed at and not intended to be used by children under the age of thirteen (13). If you’re aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen (13), please let us know by contacting us, and we’ll delete that information.

Additional Privacy Notice for non-US, non-UK, and non-EU residents
As a part of our standard business practices, data is transferred outside of many visitors' countries of residence and predominantly used, accessed and processed within the U.S. Fortunately, given the robust and rigorous nature of privacy laws in the US, UK, and EU with which we comply,
BetterHelp
considers that this has the effect of protecting user information in a way that, overall, is at least substantially similar or in many ways exceeds non-US data privacy legal requirements.
BetterHelp
is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF) which has been recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data transferred to participating US companies. To learn more about the DPF click
here
. To the extent we contract with vendors who are outside of the U.S, we ensure that specific safeguards have been established to protect that data.
Data Privacy Framework Compliance
BetterHelp
complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("EU-U.S. DPF"), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("Swiss-U.S. DPF") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively "the Data Privacy Framework").
BetterHelp
has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union, and the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) and to the Swiss-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
If you are located in the EU, UK or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the Personal Data that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles. We will give you an opportunity to opt out where Personal Data we control about you is to be disclosed to an independent third party or used for a purpose that is materially different from those set out in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us via the details provided below.
In compliance with the DPF Principles,
BetterHelp
commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Data. We will investigate and attempt to resolve any DPF Principles-related complaints within 45 days.

Please note that under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
SECTION
7
Defining key policy terms
1
Process
In this Policy, we refer generally to activities done with data as "Processing" or "Process." Examples of Processing include collecting, storing, and using data.
2
Third Party
For the purposes of this Policy, a Third Party means an entity that is not
BetterHelp
, not a
Service Provider
, not a Therapist or any other parties that are specifically called out in this Policy.
3
Connect you with therapy services
In order for us to connect you with therapy services on our Platform, we need to be able to facilitate information sharing between you and your Therapist so that you can get the help you need from them. We also Process data like your Therapist preferences, your state (if applicable), and your country to determine what Therapist to suggest to you based on applicable licensing or accreditation requirements.
4
Facilitate tools for you and your Therapist
Once you start therapy, we need to process certain data to enable therapy tools within the Platform such as journal entries, setting goals and providing relevant worksheets. These help facilitate a more effective therapeutic experience and outcome.
5
Communicate with you
For example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we’re able to respond to you and provide an answer.
Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization’s account, answer questions, and provide support.
6
Monitor and improve therapy quality
For example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you. We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform. If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the
BetterHelp
Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes. For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care. In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
7
Personalize your web or app experience
For example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs. Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.
8
Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new features
For example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value. We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again. Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact. We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately. In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties. This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.
9
Comply with laws
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care. This is not unique to
BetterHelp
and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
10
Protect your safety and the safety of others
For example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.
11
Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your account
For example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts. We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting. You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time. If you engage with us in a professional capacity on behalf of an organization, such as a
BetterHelp Business Account
Administrator, then we might email promotions, discounts, and therapy-related news and content we think might be relevant to your organization. You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
12
Service Provider
We define a Service Provider as a person or company that we have a legal agreement with to Process data collected by us or on our behalf. Data that is Processed on our behalf is required to be done only at our direction - no other person or company can authorize it. Our Service Providers are not permitted to disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers’ own subcontractors provided that they’re bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider’s terms.
The data obtained by Service Providers from their relationship with us must only be used for performing the services specified in our agreement with them, or as reasonably necessary to perform one or more of the following:
Comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process;
Detect, prevent or mitigate fraud or security vulnerabilities;
Debug to identify and repair errors impairing existing intended functionalities; and/or
Conduct internal research for technological development and demonstration of our products or services, if such use is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which the data was shared.
13
External Identifier
An identifier issued by or belonging to an external entity that is not BetterHelp (such as a Service Provider or Third Party) such as a “click” identifier, a cookie identifier or device identifier. Examples of External Identifiers are the  Google Click ID, Google Advertising ID, IDFA, Meta Click ID, and the TikTok click ID.
14
Internal Identifier
An identifier issued by, belonging to or hosted on-premises by BetterHelp that is unique to a user. Examples of Internal Identifiers are User ID’s (and hashed User ID’s) and internal identifiers issued to conduct internal first-party analytics.
15
Monitor and protect the security of the Platform
For example, we process certain data to make sure only you are able to access your account, and to place controls or challenges to prevent unauthorized access. We may also process some of your data when issuing security patches and bug fixes in order to address security risks. We may also process your data to track potential abuse on the platform, prevent and detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google
to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.

These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more

and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
