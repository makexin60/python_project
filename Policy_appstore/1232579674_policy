8. Data Retention
8.1. Because we're a regulated financial institution, Paxum Bank is obliged to store some of your personal and transactional data for up to 7 years following the closure of your account. Only a small number of our employees can see that data, and they'll only look at it if they need to. We always delete information that we no longer need. And everything we need to keep is subject to the highest levels of security.
Please note: Retention periods could be subject to change, depending on where you live, changes to regulatory requirements, or other legal obligations with which we need to comply.
8.2. Paxum Bank is required to retain all data associated with accounts determined to have been opened for seven years following account closure.
For the purposes of data retention, Paxum Bank considers an account to be "open" once an application for a Paxum Bank or Paxum.com account has been submitted. An account is not required to be verified and active in order for it to be considered open. Submitting an account application and agreeing to Paxum Bank's Terms and Conditions, including this Privacy Policy, renders the account "open" and subject to data retention.
8.3. In the event of identity theft, the Bank remains obligated to retain personal data submitted to the Bank, regardless of the circumstances of the identity theft.
8.4. Basis of Retention: Even if you exercise your right to request data erasure vis-à-vis your personal data held by Paxum Bank, we may not be able to accommodate your request to other legal obligations of the Bank, including data retention for the purposes of complying with the Proceeds of Crime Act (2014) and its associated regulations and amendments.
For example, if you wish to exercise your rights under GDPR to request the erasure of your data, you should keep in mind that Paxum Bank is entitled to retain all records related to natural and legal persons who apply for or who obtain a Paxum Bank account under:
Recital 19 of the GDPR
Article 6.1c of the GDPR
Article 6.1e of the GDPR
Article 17.3 of the GDPR
We are entitled to retain your personal data, including sensitive personal data, because we are obliged to keep your data on file for a period of 7 years following the closure of your account to meet our legal obligations under the Proceeds of Crime Act (2014) and associated legislation and regulations.
Paxum Bank also reserves the right to refuse a data erasure request following the data retention period in rare circumstances where it has a legal obligation to retain that data.
