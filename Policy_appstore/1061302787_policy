Identity and Compliance Information
, including name, birthdate, address, phone number, email address, bank account information, government ID number and copies of government ID or tax documents, along with a selfie image. We may use data collection and verification services provided by a third-party provider, Persona, to collect and verify such information in order to comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud and abuse. Persona may use a combination of machine-learning tools and optical scans to authenticate your identity document, and may use facial recognition technology to produce a unique biometric identifier based on facial geometry that can be used to compare your selfie to the image on the identity document you provided to determine the likelihood that the images are a "match." We do not receive the biometric identifier generated from the images. It is generated and held by Persona until we inform them that the biometric identifier is no longer needed for the purposes described in this paragraph and must be destroyed. For identity verification and security purposes, we will have access to the selfie image and will receive the information extracted from the scan of the government ID document as well as the results of the identity verification process. We may use this process and associated information to verify your identity, authenticate your identity documents, comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud and misrepresentation. We do not use, disclose or retain your biometric information for any other commercial purpose. Our third-party provider, Persona, processes this information on our behalf strictly in accordance with our contractual agreements. For more information on Persona's data processing practices, please see Persona's Privacy Policy (available
here
).

HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?
We share your information with third parties in the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this notice:
Service Providers
. With vendors, service providers, and consultants that need access to personal information to perform services for us, such as website development and other related services, app development, hosting, maintenance, data analytics and storage, customer support, payment processing, shipping, fraud detection and remediation, user information verification and authentication, advertising, and other services.
Other Users
. With other users of our Services, such as if you submit a product review, post content in a public area of our Services, and through publicly displayed features of our Services. We also may share your contact details with the buyer or seller you are dealing with if it is necessary for them to buy or sell an item from or to you, or if we are required to do so by applicable laws and regulations. As an essential element of the Services, some of the information you provide to us when you register or update your account profile is displayed on your profile and shared with other users. Your User Content, including photos, messages, posts, item and brand "favorites", follower and following lists, purchase history, and other content you post to the Site may also be displayed for public consumption. We may display this content through our Services, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third-party sites and services. Once displayed on publicly viewable pages, that content can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your content or what other users may do with the content that is made public, so we encourage you to not put any sensitive, confidential, or any other information you do not wish to be shared on your account profile, in your listings, messages, or otherwise throughout the Services. Once content is public, while you may still be able to edit and delete some aspects of it on the Services, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others.
You may also elect to share some of your information directly with other
Grailed
users through the Services. We strongly advise you to use the utmost caution before sharing any information with others, including users. You should not, under any circumstances, provide your financial information (e.g., credit card or bank account numbers, etc.) to other individuals.
Contests and Promotions Providers

Ad Networks and Advertising Partners

These parties may collect information directly from a browser or device when an individual visits our Services through cookies or other data collection technologies. This information is used to provide and inform targeted advertising, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. Please see our
Cookie Policy
for more information.
Affiliates
. Between and among other entities under common ownership as
Grailed
, as well as our ultimate holding company (i.e., any organization that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries it owns, particularly when we collaborate in providing the Services.
Legal Obligations and Rights
. We may disclose personal information to third parties, such as legal advisors and law enforcement:
in connection with the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims;
to comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process;
to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of others, including to enforce our agreements and policies;

PUBLIC CONTENT
Some of the information and activity associated with your user account profile is always public. This includes your username, bio, country of residence, profile picture, average shipping time as a seller, and listing activity as a seller. If you do not want third parties to see this information, we suggest changing your username, profile picture, or bio. Some of the information and activity associated with your user profile is public by default but may be made private by you through your Account Settings (e.g., listing and brand "favorites" lists, follows of other users' account profiles or your account profile followers). However, parts of your follow activity may remain public if those you follow or that follow you maintain their account settings as public (e.g., you may still be visible as a follower on the account profile of someone you follow that has a public list of followers). Other content (e.g., your purchase history, including price of the purchased items) is private by default but you may choose to make it public and may then change your mind at any time through your Account Settings. Your "saved" listings are always private. In order to publicize your "saved" listings, add them to your "favorites" list and ensure your "favorites" list is public. When content is public, it can be seen by anyone on or across our Services.
Grailed
, you and other users on the Services may send public content (such as your profile photo, listings, or information you share) to anyone on or off the Services. For example, users may share it in a public forum, or it may appear in search results on the internet. You can control which parts of your user account profile and activity are made public within your Account Settings.
THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING
We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our online services over time so that they may play or display ads on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Site, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research to us. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.

Cookie Policy

Data Retention and Deletion
Grailed
retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above, and in accordance with our legitimate business interests and applicable law. However, if necessary, we may retain personal data for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority. The period for which we retain user data is determined by the type of data, the category of user to whom the data relates, and the purposes for which we collected the data.
To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data and if we can attain our objectives by other means. The length for which we retain user data may further be determined by legal and regulatory requirements, purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or by issues relating to the user's account such as an unresolved claim or dispute.
For example:
We retain user data that is collected in order to provide our Services, such as the user profile information and credentials, for the lifetime of the user's account.
We retain certain categories of data of all users for a period unrelated to the lifetime of the user's account to avoid fraudulent use of the Services. The period for which the data is retained will be determined by the necessity of the data for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, as well as legal and regulatory requirements. Examples include customer service communications on safety or trust incidents, which are retained for 12 years.
Pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user's account such as an unresolved claim or dispute, we may retain certain categories of data after the deletion of the user's account, such as user profile information and tax data. This generally means that we retain such data for 12 years after a deletion request.
If your personal information is subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or United Kingdom GDPR, the criteria used to determine the period for which personal data about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal data:
Contract
. Where we are processing personal data based on contract, we generally will retain your personal data for the duration of the contract plus some additional reasonable period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from our contractual relationship.
Legitimate Interests
. Where we are processing personal data based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account your fundamental interests and your rights and freedoms.
Consent
. Where we are processing personal data based on your consent, we generally will retain your personal data until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal data.
Legal Obligation
. Where we are processing personal data based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain your personal data for the period of time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation.
Legal Claim
. We may need to apply a "legal hold" that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to establish a claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
When an individual discontinues the use of our Services, we will retain their personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, including fraud prevention, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as, for any additional purpose based on the choices they have made, such as to receive marketing communications. In particular, we will retain personal data supplied when joining our Services, including complaints, claims and any other personal data supplied during the duration of an individual's contract with us until the statutory limitation periods have expired.
In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data.
Once retention of the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal data or, if this is not possible (e.g., because personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal data and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.
Control Over Your Information
Device Permissions
. You may control the Services' access to your device information through the "Settings" app on your device. For instance, you can withdraw permission for the Services to access your network devices and geolocation and to integrate with your other apps.
Accessing Data
. Users can access their data including their profile data and transaction history through the
Grailed
app or via the Site. Users can also request access to their data by emailing

Push Notifications
. You can stop receiving push notifications from us by changing your preferences in the iOS or Android notifications settings menu.
Modifying or Deleting Your Information

Grailed

here

CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION
The Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16. If an individual is under the age of 16, they should not use the Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child's parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete that personal information.
LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES OR SERVICES
Our Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and apps. Except where we post, link to or expressly adopt or refer to this Privacy Notice, this Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any personal information practices of third-party websites and online services or the practices of other third parties.

CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY NOTICE
