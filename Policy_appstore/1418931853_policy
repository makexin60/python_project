Kriegspiel is a noncommercial game produced and maintained by Alexander R. Galloway.
No data is collected from players by default.
Players may voluntarily opt-in to data analytics. For players participating in
data analytics, I collect gameplay data in order to diagnose how players
interact with the game, and for developing new features.
No data is tied to personal information such as proper name or address.
And no data is ever disclosed to a third party.
Players may update their data collection preferences at any time in the game settings.
Data Collection Disclosure
For players participating in data analytics, I collect two types of data:
1) Start-game events such as matchmaking requests. This is in order to measure
the average length of time it takes to match online players, and to get a sense of
which type of game is played most.
2) The state of the game board at the end of each turn. This is in order to
train a machine learning model, which will hopefully improve the skill level
of the single-player game AI in the future.
This data includes your Game Center nickname and a randomly assigned unique
identifying number.
Please get in touch if you have any questions or concerns.
