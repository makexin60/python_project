Pursuant to Article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27
April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to
the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such
data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection
Regulation) (General Data Protection Regulation – „GDPR”)
we inform that:
1) The administrator of your personal data, i.e. the entity
who decides how your personal data will be processed, is AfterMarket.pl
Limited, registered in accordance with the article
113 of the Corporate Law of the Republic of Cyprus under number
HE 245422 (hereafter called „the Company”).
2) The Company will process the following personal data: first
name, surname, user identifier on the Company’s website,
address of residence or registered office, correspondence
address, e-mail address, telephone number, payment data
(including bank account number and hash of the credit card
number), internet address of the device you are using, identifier
of your Internet browser, domain names registered by you as well
as orders placed by you and transactions made by you on the
Company’s website, and, in special circumstances, your personal 
identification number and identification document data.
3) Your personal data will be processed in order to conclude
and perform a contract for the use of electronic services ordered
by you and provided by the Company, including processing of
complaints and solving technical problems. For this purpose, the
personal data will be processed pursuant to Article 6 paragraph
1(b) of the GDPR. Data concerning your domain names, orders and
transactions, browser identifier and internet address of the
device as well as payment data will also be used to ensure that
the transaction is made correctly in accordance with the law and
the Company rules. For this purpose, and for the purposes of
possible judicial proceedings, the personal data will be
processed pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 1(f) of the GDPR. 
Data concerning your personal identification number or your identification
document data will be processed in situations when the Company has grounds
for doubting the truthfullness of your data (for example, if your data
has been provided by a third party without your authorization) or
its completeness. In such case, the personal data will be
processed pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 1(f) of the GDPR
on order to properly identify the party to the agreement.
If your personal data are processed in order to fulfill the
obligations resulting from provisions of law, including tax and
accounting regulations, the basis for the processing will be
Article 6 paragraph 1(c) of the GDPR.
4) The recipients of your personal data will be registries of
Internet domain names (depending on the domain name you hold or
intend to hold), as well as parking websites, in which you will
park your domains.
5) In the case of registration of Internet domain names from
countries outside the European Economic Area, global domains or
registration of a parking account with Sedo LLC, your personal
data will be transferred to a third country on the basis of an
agreement concluded for the provision of electronic services with
the Company. By contacting our customer service, you can obtain a
copy of the personal data transferred to a third country.
6) Your personal data will be stored for as long as you use
services provided electronically to you by the Company, as well
as for the time necessary to pursue possible claims or for the
period required by the provisions of tax law, but no longer than
6 years after concluding the contract.
7) You have the right to access the content of your data and
the right to rectify, erase, limit the processing, the right to
transfer the data, and also the right to object, which is only
valid for personal data processed on the basis of Article 6
paragraph 1(f) of the GDPR, indicated above.
8) You have the right to lodge a complaint with the President
of the Office for Personal Data Protection if you consider that
the processing of your personal data violates the provisions of
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
9) Providing your personal data is a condition of concluding
and performing the contract for the provision of electronic
services by the Company. You are obliged to provide such
information, and the consequence of a failure to provide your
personal data will be the impossibility to conclude and perform a
contract for the provision of electronic services by the Company.
10) Your web browser identifier, internet device address,
registered domain names, orders and transactions as well as
payment data will be processed automatically, also in the form of
profiling to determine whether your transaction on the Company’s
website complies with the provisions of law and the Company’s
rules. One possible consequence of such processing is making it
impossible to use certain functions of the Company’s website if
it is found that a provision of law or the Company’s rules has
been breached. This data can also be processed in order to create
personalized suggestions of domain names and services available
for purchase; you can object to processing your data with that
purpose.
