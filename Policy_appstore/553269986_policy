(“Privacy Policy”)
describes how and when we may collect, use, secure, and share information collected in connection with our games, mobile applications, websites, content, products, and any related services (collectively, the
“Services”

or
“us”
) refers to AppA11y, Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers, and directors for websites and applications that link to this Privacy Policy or otherwise make it available to you.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We may update it from time to time by posting a new version on AppA11y.com with an updated date (the
“Effective Date”
). If we make material changes, we will notify you, prior to the changes becoming effective, through the Services or by other means if you’ve provided us additional contact information (e.g., using the email address associated with your Account, as defined in our
Terms of Service
). Your continued use of the Services after the Effective Date will be an acknowledgement of our updated practices.
If there is any difference between the English version and any other language version of this Privacy Policy, the English version will apply (to the extent of the difference and to the extent permitted by applicable law).

Following the closure of your Account, we may retain personal information where required by law or where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, we may retain such information to provide you a service you have requested, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, or where necessary for fraud prevention, dispute resolution, enforcement of our contracts and terms, or for safety reasons (e.g., we may retain certain information about an Account to prevent that player from opening a new Account).

Security
We follow generally accepted industry standards and maintain reasonable safeguards designed to secure the information in our possession, and take steps to ensure only those at AppA11y with a legitimate business need to access your personal information are permitted to do so. We also take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer information will provide protections appropriate to that type of information. If you have reason to believe that your personal information is no longer secure, please immediately contact us as set forth below in the “Contact Us” section.
Use By Minors
Our Services are designed for a general audience and require all players to be above the minimum age to consent for data processing (for example, 13 years old in the United States, and 16 years old in some parts of the EU) as a condition of access. An exception to this is our game STUMBLE GUYS, which allows younger players to play. As such, we take additional steps to limit access to certain features of STUMBLE GUYS based on players’ ages, and also limit the personal information collection and sharing of such younger players’ information to only what is necessary to support our internal operations.
If you are a parent or guardian of a minor, and believe that minor has uploaded personal information in connection with our Services without your consent, or if you wish to review information collected from your minor child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described in “Contact Us” below. If we become aware that a minor has provided us with personal information in violation of applicable law, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and revert them to the underage experience, if applicable.
Additional Information for Residents of the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Brazil
If you are a resident of a member country of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or Brazil, then in accordance with applicable law, you may have the following rights:
Access:
to obtain confirmation regarding whether we process your personal information, and to and obtain a copy of the personal information we have collected about you. (Note that this right only applies to personal information relating to you, and not to any other player or person.)
Rectification or Correction: to correct your personal information where it is inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated.
Erasure (deletion):
to request that AppA11y delete your personal information, for example when it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which AppA11y collected it. This right may be limited to the extent that AppA11y is permitted or required by applicable law to retain your information. (Note that if you request deletion of your personal information, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you share devices with someone else who uses the Services, that person may also lose game progress or related Account information and access. If you decide to use or access the Services again, AppA11y may consider this a new Account and may collect personal information associated with that Account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)
Restriction or objection to processing:
to object to AppA11y’s processing of your personal information, or request that AppA11y restrict that processing. Because the information that AppA11y collects is generally required to provide the Services to you, if you object to the processing of your personal information, this may have the same effect as requesting deletion of this information. This right may be limited to the extent that AppA11y is permitted or required by applicable law to continue processing the information. (Note that if you object to the processing of your personal information, you and others who use your devices to access the Services may no longer be able to use or access the Services.)
Portability
: to receive a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format so that you can transmit it elsewhere.
Request to be informed:
to request information about third parties with which your personal information has been shared.
Request review:
to review decisions taken exclusively based on automated processing if these decisions could affect your data subject rights.
To exercise these rights, please see “Your Rights and Choices” above.
In addition to the rights described above, if we have collected and processed certain types of personal information with your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time in the manner described when you provided consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted prior to then, nor will it affect any processing based on lawful grounds other than consent.
You may have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, contact your local data protection authority. We will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities to resolve any privacy-related complaints that cannot be amicably resolved between you and us.
Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information
If you are from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the type of information and the context in which we collect it. In general, we collect personal information from you only:
Where we have your consent to do so, such as before we use or share your information for advertising that is targeted based on your browsing history, online behavior, or other personal information that we or third parties may have collected about you. If you consent to our use of your personal information for any purpose, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us, as explained above;
Where we need it to perform a contract with you;
Where it is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information, for example, for the following purposes:
- Product and Service development, management, delivery, and enhancement;
- Fraud detection and prevention;
- Network and system security;
- General corporate operations;
- Compliance with applicable foreign laws;
- Communications regarding your purchases; and
- Non-targeted marketing and advertising.
Where we have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need it to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If you have questions about the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at support@AppA11y.com.
International data transfer
Your personal information might be transferred to a country outside the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.
If we transfer personal information which originates in the EEA, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or similar contractual safeguards, and, if necessary, the implementation of further technical and organizational measures.

: depending on the site you are visiting or the app you are visiting and your relationship with us, you have the right to opt-out of certain information sharing practices with Third Parties who do not act as our Service Providers. In some states, like California, this information sharing may qualify as a “share” or a “sale,” while in other states, like Virginia, this information sharing may qualify as “targeted advertising” (collectively, “personalized advertising”). If you wish to opt-out of personalized advertising associated with our games, please visit the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” setting found in a game’s settings menu, or by contacting us as set forth below.
Correction

If you wish to exercise any of the rights described above, please follow the instructions in “Your Rights and Choices” above. We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you submit any of the requests listed above.
Verification and Appeal Process
: We are required by law to take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your request. Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). Please do not delete our game until your request is fulfilled. If we are unable to process your request via our in-game help ticket system, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity, such as your name, email address, and information about your interactions with us or with one of our games. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.
If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.

If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a Californian player to communicate with us or to exercise a privacy right discussed above, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the player, and have sufficient access to that player’s laptop, desktop, or mobile device to exercise that player’s right digitally. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of a AppA11y player, then you can make a request on the player’s behalf by contacting us as set forth below in the “Contact Us” section with supporting verification information with proof that you have access to the player’s interface (including, for certain requests, written permission from the player) and proof of your own identity.

(The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your personal information in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please contact us at support@AppA11y.com.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.
Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.
Get Involved
GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
