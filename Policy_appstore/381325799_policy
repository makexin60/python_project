More specifically:
Why?
A. To create and maintain the contractual relation established for the provision of the product and/or service requested by you in all its phases and by way of any possible integration and modification or to take steps at your request in relation to pre-contractual measures (e.g. facilitating your bookings and taking payments; responding to your questions and concerns; administering your account).

Finally, in order to access the Customer Care and receive assistance in a timely and efficient manner, you will be asked to enter the identification code of your booking (so-called "Booking ID"). If you contact our Customer Care Team by using the same telephone number entered during the booking process, the Booking ID will be automatically recognised.
On which legal basis?
To fulfil a contract, or take steps linked to a contract (i.e. to provide the products and/or the services you request and/or to provide you with any clarification or assistance) as well as to pursue our own and our Customers' legitimate interest (i.e. providing and receiving an immediate and efficient customer care service). In case the fulfillment of the contract implies the processing of sensitive data, in the event that GDPR applies, we will rely also on your explicit consent.
Why?
B. If permitted by the applicable law, to request your participation in our surveys conducted via email, phone, SMS, recorded calls or other similar technologies from time to time, so that you can tell us about your experience as a recipient of the Service. We will use your feedback to develop and improve our services. Following our analyses of your feedback, we may consider it necessary to contact you to provide you with a response to your survey submission. You can inform us at anytime if you no longer want to receive our surveys by writing to privacy.en@lastminutegroup.com. Please note that your participation in the survey is voluntary and there are no consequences should you prefer not to participate.

Why?
E. To send you (in cases permitted by law excepting where you did not object) advertising material via email or, where permitted by the law, other equivalent electronic communication regarding products and services similar to those already purchased by you and offered on our Website.

If you have already given us your consent to profiling activities through marketing cookies or other means, we may send personalised communications. The personalised service or the offers can be related to  the following sectors (please note that we do not share your email address with third parties): tourism, leisure, entertainment, high technology, fashion, decoration, consumer goods, food and beverage, finance, banking, insurance, energy, environment, communication, mass media, real estate, pharmaceuticals, clothing and textiles, education and training, energy, publications and publishing, information and communications technology, retail, sport, telecommunications and general services.

- analyse information about the way you engage with communication material you receive from us, such as data on when emails have been opened or to determine if you have viewed or interacted with an ad, to record the number of times you have viewed each ad, to prevent a single ad being shown to you too frequently etc.;
- temporarily share an encrypted version of your email address, with carefully selected partners who may combine this information with other forms of online identifiers or other personal data in order to present you with our offers cross device or cross channel, for example on social networks (Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter);
- use automated decision making to segment and target product offers based on your demands and needs. This allows us to be more focused, efficient and cost effective with our resources and also reduces the risk of someone receiving information they may find inappropriate or irrelevant. You can always request a manual decision-making process instead, express your opinion or contest decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, if such a decision would produce legal effects or otherwise similarly significantly affect you. For further details, you may contact our Data Protection Officers whose details are provided in this privacy policy.

10. Privacy notice for Facebook
10.1. Facebook Custom Audiences - Facebook pixel
We use the remarketing function “Custom Audiences” of Facebook Inc. (1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025) or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. This function allows us to show our Users and/or Customers of our website interest-based ads when they visit Facebook (“Facebook ads”), and to analyze such Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, which helps us optimize future advertising. This allows us to serve more relevant advertising.
For this purpose we use the so-called Facebook pixel for our website.
When a User or a Customer visits our website and takes an action (for example, buying something), the Facebook pixel is triggered and reports this action. This way, we will know when a customer took an action after seeing our Facebook ad. We will also be able to reach this customer again by using a Custom Audience. Therefore, this pixel allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our Website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This way, we will know when a customer took an action after seeing our Facebook ad. We will also be able to reach this customer again by using a Custom Audience.
Therefore, this enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage Policy
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy
. Such data may allow Facebook and its partners to show ads on or off Facebook. A cookie may also be stored on your computer for these purposes.
10.2. Facebook SDK
Within our App, we use the Software Development Kit (SDK) from Facebook. The Facebook SDK is issued and administered by Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. By means of this integration, we can link various Facebook services with our App (i.e. Facebook Analytics, Facebook Ads, Facebook Login via the SDK, Facebook Account Ki, Facebook Share, Facebook Graph API and Facebook App Events).
In particular, we have linked the following SDK Facebook services with our App:
Facebook Login
: to provide you with the possibility to register or log in with your Facebook account
Facebook App Events
: To understand people's actions in our app and measure the effectiveness of your Mobile App Ads. We use this service  to evaluate the reach of our advertising campaigns and use of Facebook SDK. Facebook merely provides us with an aggregated analysis of user behavior within our app.
In addition, as our App is linked to SDK Facebook services, we have to follow Facebook policies, which include that we are obliged to share with Facebook, when you download the App, even when you are not logged in to the social media platform, the following data:
Anonymous online identifier;
Information confirming that you have download our App;
