Personal Data Protection is important to us
Protection of your Personal Data is important to us. This Ascott Personal Data Protection Policy (“
Policy
”) outlines how we manage the Personal Data we hold. The Policy applies to all departments and business units across the Ascott Group (Data controller). The Ascott Limited (Reg. No.197900881N), and/or its related corporations and affiliates (referred to hereunder as “
Ascott
”, the “
Ascott Group
”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collectively or singularly as the context requires, recognise the importance of protecting Personal Data.
We respect the confidentiality of Personal Data and privacy of individuals and are committed to complying with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (Act 26 of 2012) (“
PDPA
”) and other applicable data protection laws, including the European Union (“
EU
”) General Data Protection Regulation (“
GDPR
”) Law on Information Technology and Freedom (France) (accessible at http://www.cnil.fr), Australia Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), Cybersecurity law of China,  California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“
CCPA
”), Electronic Information and Transactions Indonesia and Malaysia Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) of 2010) where applicable. Please read this Policy so that you know and understand the purposes for which we collect, use and disclose your Personal Data.
We adopt a pragmatic“Data-
light
, Data-
tight
”approach in our business conduct.
“Data-
light
” means that we collect Personal Data only for what is required in business or in activities conducted by our organisation and will properly destroy the Personal Data once there is no business or legal purpose. We do not collect Personal Data randomly or indiscriminately without purpose.
“Data-
tight
” means that we do not disclose your Personal Data unless prior consent has been obtained and we have administrative, physical and Information Technology (IT) security measures to protect your Personal Data.
This Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consents you may have previously provided to us in respect of your Personal Data, and your consents herein are additional to any rights which any member of the Ascott Group may have at law to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data. This Policy does not affect any rights which we may have at law in connection with the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, nothing in this Policy establishes any joint and several liability on the part of the Ascott Group members.
1.
Your Personal Data
1.1.    “

In order to provide you with better service, we may also collect your preferences, e.g. smoking or non-smoking room, the preferred location of your apartment (low floor, high floor, etc.), type of bed, preferred newspaper etc. All those additional information will be collected in compliance with local laws and regulations.
1.2.    In addition, if your Personal Data has been collected, used or disclosed by us in a particular jurisdiction which has specific requirements or exceptions to the definition of Personal Data, including sensitive Personal Data, we will comply with those requirements under the applicable data protection regulations in that jurisdiction.

2.1.    We collect your Personal Data in the following ways:
a)    when you make a reservation (for example through our global reservation team over the phone or online);

.
For avoidance of doubt, Personal Data collected by third party brand operators of our properties is not covered by this Policy. Third party brand operators refer to operators who are not members of the Ascott Group. These third party brand operators operate their business on these properties independently of the Ascott Group and the Personal Data of individuals such as guests and vendors are collected by the third party brand operators for themselves. The Ascott Group does not have access to such Personal Data. Individuals should check directly with the third party brand operators on their data rights.
3.7.    Your Personal Data will be protected and kept confidential, but subject to the provisions of any applicable law, your Personal Data may, depending on the products or services concerned, be disclosed to third parties set out below. Such disclosure may be subject to additional legal requirements under applicable law, depending on the nature of such transfer to third parties. Your Personal Data will, in each case, only be disclosed to the extent necessary and proportionate.
The third parties are:
a)    other divisions or entities within the CapitaLand Group;
b)    our joint venture/ alliance partners;
c)    our agents, contractors, third party service providers and specialist advisers who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, research, operational or other services in pursuance of the purposes set out in this Policy, such as telecommunications, information technology, payment, processing, market research, storage and archival;
d)    any third party business partners who offer goods and services or sponsor contests or other promotional programmes, whether in conjunction with us or not, and where permitted by applicable laws;
e)    insurers or insurance investigators and credit providers;
f)    the Credit Bureau, or in the event of default or disputes, any debt collection agencies or dispute resolution centres;
g)    any business partner, investor, assignee or transferee (actual or prospective) to facilitate business asset transactions (which may extend to any merger, acquisition or asset sale) involving the CapitaLand Group;
h)    our professional advisors such as our auditors and lawyers;
i)    relevant government regulators or authority or law enforcement agency to comply with any laws or rules and regulations imposed by any governmental authority;

k)    banks, credit card companies and their respective service providers; and
l)    any other party as may be consented to by you, as specified by you or as may be notified to you by us in subsequent notices.
In the event that your Personal Data is shared with a third party that acts with a member of the Ascott Group as joint controllers under GDPR, we will, to the extent required by law, provide you with additional information on the responsibilities of each joint controller, any particular means by which you can enforce your rights and the primary contact person for such requests in relation to your rights.
We do not monetise your personal data.  We are not aware of any monetarisation of your personal data by third party advertisers or social networking platform without your consent.  For the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, please note therefore that there is no need for you to request to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties since no-sale is the default and only position applicable.
3.8.    We require that organisations outside the Ascott Group which handle or obtain Personal Data as service providers to us acknowledge the confidentiality of this data, undertake to respect any individual's right to privacy and comply with the PDPA, GDPR, CCPA and any other applicable data protection laws.

We also require that these organisations use this information only for our purposes and follow our directions with respect to this information.
3.9    Conditions on Personal Data applicable to Intermediaries: In particular, travel agents and other parties who submit Personal Data of other individuals through our website in connection with reservations or bookings at properties owned or managed by us ("
Intermediaries
") agree with and undertake to us that in doing so they (1) shall comply with all applicable data protection laws to the extent relevant, (2) shall ensure that such submission and disclosure is permitted under applicable data protection laws, and further represent and warrant that the necessary and appropriate consents from the individuals to whom the Personal Data relates have been obtained (directly or indirectly), in compliance with applicable data protection laws, so as to enable such Personal Data to be disclosed to, collected, used and otherwise processed by us (and our agents and service providers) for purposes of the reservations or bookings and related purposes (and where Intermediaries have consented on behalf of other individuals to the receiving of marketing and promotional materials, the foregoing representation and warranty on consents extends to such additional purposes), in compliance with applicable data protection laws, (3) shall keep and maintain complete and proper records of the consents obtained and upon our request shall provide copies of such consents, and (4) have read, understood and agreed to this Ascott Personal Data Protection Policy.

a)    other divisions or entities within the CapitaLand Group;
b)    our joint venture/ alliance partners;

e)    insurers or insurance investigators and credit providers;

h)    our professional advisors such as our auditors and lawyers;

l)    any other party as may be consented to by you, as specified by you or as may be notified to you by us in subsequent notices.

We do not monetise your personal data.  We are not aware of any monetarisation of your personal data by third party advertisers or social networking platform without your consent.  For the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, please note therefore that there is no need for you to request to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties since no-sale is the default and only position applicable.
3.8.    We require that organisations outside the Ascott Group which handle or obtain Personal Data as service providers to us acknowledge the confidentiality of this data, undertake to respect any individual's right to privacy and comply with the PDPA, GDPR, CCPA and any other applicable data protection laws.

We also require that these organisations use this information only for our purposes and follow our directions with respect to this information.
3.9    Conditions on Personal Data applicable to Intermediaries: In particular, travel agents and other parties who submit Personal Data of other individuals through our website in connection with reservations or bookings at properties owned or managed by us ("
Intermediaries
") agree with and undertake to us that in doing so they (1) shall comply with all applicable data protection laws to the extent relevant, (2) shall ensure that such submission and disclosure is permitted under applicable data protection laws, and further represent and warrant that the necessary and appropriate consents from the individuals to whom the Personal Data relates have been obtained (directly or indirectly), in compliance with applicable data protection laws, so as to enable such Personal Data to be disclosed to, collected, used and otherwise processed by us (and our agents and service providers) for purposes of the reservations or bookings and related purposes (and where Intermediaries have consented on behalf of other individuals to the receiving of marketing and promotional materials, the foregoing representation and warranty on consents extends to such additional purposes), in compliance with applicable data protection laws, (3) shall keep and maintain complete and proper records of the consents obtained and upon our request shall provide copies of such consents, and (4) have read, understood and agreed to this Ascott Personal Data Protection Policy.

While not all franchisees and Associates will be directly subject to the Privacy Act in relation to their information handling practices, this policy will generally apply to them.
In addition to this privacy policy, there may be additional privacy policies which apply from time to time in respect of specific activities, in certain circumstances or with respect to particular entities (“Additional Privacy Policy”). We recommend that you always read any applicable Additional Privacy Policy. Where there is any inconsistency between this privacy policy and any Additional Privacy Policies, the Additional Privacy Policy prevails.

Purposes of data processing
We may collect and process your personal data for the following purposes and on the following legal bases:
In connection with our legitimate interests in carrying on our business
We may use and process your data for our legitimate interests (where we have considered these are not overridden by your rights and which you have the right to object to as explained below) in:
identifying opportunities to improve Quest's offerings and operations
conducting research to serve you better by understanding your preferences to ensure we send you appropriate promotions and campaigns
assisting in arrangements with other organisations in relation to services that Quest provides to you
allowing us to operate our business as a franchisor and provider of accommodation, perform administrative and operational tasks (such as training staff, risk management; developing and marketing products and services, undertaking planning, research and statistical analysis; providing customer support; and systems development and testing)
verifying your identity, preventing or investigating any misconduct, fraud or crime, or any suspected misconduct, fraud or crime.
Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
Quest may need to collect and process your personal data in connection with an agreement with you or to perform our obligations under a contract with you in relation to the services we provide including bookings and to process payments you make.
Under a legal obligation
We may also use and process your personal data if we are authorised or required by applicable laws, regulations or codes that bind us.
With your consent
Where required, we will only use your personal data for the purpose/s for which you have given your valid or explicit consent, which Quest will obtain before processing your data.  Some data you provide may be more sensitive and therefore falls within a special category of personal data, such as health data. Quest will collect and process this data only with your explicit consent.  You can withdraw your consent by contacting us using the contact details above.
For direct marketing
We may communicate with you (through the preferred communication channel(s) you have selected, which may include by email, telephone, SMS, iM, mail, or any other electronic means including via social networking forums) to, amongst other things, tell you about products, services, event and offers that we think may be of interest to you.
If you have provided your consent to receive direct marketing, you can withdraw it at any time without detriment, we will process your request as soon as practicable.  If you no longer wish to receive these emails you can contact us using our contact details above or by choosing 'unsubscribe' from our electronic communications.
Automated decision making
You have the right not to be subject to a decision made solely by automated processing. Quest has automated processing (including profiling) but does not use automated decision making solely to make any customer decisions.
Recipients of personal data
We may share your personal data with other organisations consistent with the purposes for which we collect, use and process your data as described above. This includes with the following types of entities:
our service providers, contractors, agents, other business partners within Quest and other entities who assist us in providing our services to you (for example, lawyers, conveyancers, financiers, property valuers);
external providers of services where you have engaged us to act as your agent
members of the Group as necessary and related parties appropriate for the services that you have requested
other service providers, who provide the various services that you have requested and we have arranged
third parties who provide us with marketing services and who conduct market research and analysis on our behalf
our professional advisers
an entity including government agency to whom we are required by law to disclose your data
to third parties as required to provide our services or to meet the purposes for which the personal data was collected
to third parties you otherwise authorise us to including administrators of participating frequent flier programs.
Sharing outside of the EEA
Quest primarily stores your personal data in the United Kingdom.  Where data is stored outside the United Kingdom, Quest does so in line with an enforceable contract with the storage provider, or with your express consent.
Quest may also share your personal data with the Group or entities associated with Quest, which are located in the UK, EU, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and Fiji.
Where these countries are not considered by the European Commission to be a country with equivalent privacy protections to the GDPR, Quest will take steps to protect your personal data transferred from the EEA and transfer it to other third parties in a manner consistent with legal requirements applicable to the data. We will do this by:
meeting the requirements of an applicable derogation in the GDPR, such as obtaining your consent; or
asking the recipient of personal data from Quest to sign a contract based on 'standard contractual clauses' approved by the European Commission, requiring them to protect your personal data.
What happens when we no longer need your data?
We’ll only keep your data for as long as we require it for our purposes. When we no longer require your data, we’ll ensure that your data is destroyed or de-identified.
We are required to keep your data for 7 years from the time of your booking or otherwise as required for our business operations or by applicable laws.
We may need to retain certain personal data after we cease providing you with products or services to enforce our terms, for fraud prevention, to identify, issue or resolve legal claims and/or for proper record keeping.
We may also retain a record of any stated objection by you to receiving Group marketing for the purpose of ensuring we can continue to respect your wishes and not contact you further.
