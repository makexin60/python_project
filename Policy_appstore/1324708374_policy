We and third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges may serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media ("Behavioral Ads"). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information via a Device Identifier. These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available
here
For further information on Behavioral Ads and what is known as "online behavioral advertising", U.S. residents may wish to visit
www.networkadvertising.org/optout-nonppii.asp
, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("
NAI
") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members.
Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.

Children
") and do not knowingly collect personal information from Children on our Services that require parental notice and consent under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("
COPPA
") without obtaining such parental consent.
Some of the features on our Service are "age-gated" so that they are not available for use by Children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from Children in connection with those features. When we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take additional steps to protect Children's privacy, including:
Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information.
In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their Children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their Children.
Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.
If the Service is either directed to Children or we have actual knowledge that a user is a Child, the Child may be asked to provide his or her parent's or guardian's email address.
Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.
In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any Child without first having obtained parental consent, we will dispose of that information in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your Child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent,
please contact us
.
10. What About Security?
We endeavor to incorporate commercially reasonable, technical, physical and administrative safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information in our custody and control.

11. What About Changes to the Privacy & Cookies Policy?
We reserve the right to change this Privacy & Cookies Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy & Cookies Policy and your use of our Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use. However, we will not use your previously collected Personal Information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent.

Scope:
This privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its Ad Network, Mediation Platform, Analytics Platform and Ad Quality Platform. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.
ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connetecuit and Utah, please see “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
Information We Collect:
Information collected through our Ad Network (“Ad Network Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, and a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”), or . The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize a device across apps, for advertising purposes. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of the Advertising ID under “How to Control Your Information”.

How We Use the Information We Collect:
As stated above, we provide 4 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use information across our services:
Operating our Ad Network
– We use Ad Network Information to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting, billing and attribution: We use Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud detection and prevention: We use Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.

Segmentation: We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.
Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.

– We use Ad Quality Information to operate our Ad Quality Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Ad Quality Platform in order to allow them to see which ads were served within their apps, and how such ads affected the use of their apps.

Kidoz and GDPR-K Compliance:
Safeguarding Children's Digital Privacy
At Kidoz, we recognize the paramount importance of protecting children’s privacy in the digital world. This white paper outlines our commitment and comprehensive approach to ensuring full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly its provisions for children (GDPR-K). Through our technology, stringent policies, and transparent practices, Kidoz not only meets but exceeds the requirements set forth to safeguard children’s personal data.
Background
The digital landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly when it comes to advertising to children. Compliance with GDPR-K and COPPA is not just a regulatory requirement but a cornerstone of trust between families, brands, and content publishers. Kidoz has risen to this challenge, creating a contextual mobile advertising network that respects privacy while enabling sustainable revenue for app developers.
About Kidoz
Kidoz is a leading provider of child-safe digital advertising solutions. Recognizing the vulnerability of children in the digital ecosystem, we have embedded privacy and safety into the DNA of our services, ensuring a secure and positive online experience for our young users.
Key Provisions and Kidz's Alignment
GDPR-K emphasizes several critical areas: the age of digital consent, data minimization, privacy by design, clear communication, and strict limits on data sharing and marketing. Kidoz adheres to these principles, implementing robust measures to comply with each requirement.
Kidoz's Approach to GDPR-K Compliance
Data Privacy and Protection Policies
Kidoz has developed comprehensive data protection policies that govern every aspect of our operations. From data collection to processing and sharing, we ensure the highest standards of privacy and security. Our policies are regularly reviewed and audited by an official certifier, PRIVO.
‍
Please find a case study, written by PRIVO about our effort regarding GDPR-K:
https://www.privo.com/kidoz-case-study
Consent Verification
In addressing the essential considerations surrounding the age of digital consent under GDPR-K, Kidoz adopts a universally cautious approach, operating on the principle that
ALL users
within our network are treated as if they are below the age of digital consent.
This policy underscores our steadfast commitment to privacy and safety, ensuring that no personal data is ever shared with third parties.
When responding to advertising requests, Kidoz meticulously removes any personally identifiable information (PII) from the transaction. This rigorous process ensures that every ad served through our network is entirely devoid of personal data, upholding our promise to safeguard user privacy at every turn. By default, we operate with the highest standards of data protection, effectively ensuring that our user base is shielded from any form of data sharing that could compromise their privacy.
Privacy by Design
From the initial stages of product development to each subsequent update, Kidoz integrates privacy by design principles. This approach means that every new feature, service, or product we develop undergoes rigorous privacy impact assessments to identify and mitigate risks to children's data privacy. Our engineering teams are trained to prioritize privacy, ensuring that the default settings for all our services are always set to the highest level of data protection.
Kidoz's Commitment to Clearly Labeled Advertising
Kidoz takes a transparent approach to advertising by distinctly labeling our ads, ensuring they are easily recognized as advertisements and not mistaken for content. This practice is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of our user experience, fostering trust among children, parents, and content publishers alike. By incorporating a clear, consistent watermark across all our advertisements, Kidoz guarantees that users can effortlessly distinguish between entertainment or educational content and promotional material
Ad Platform Innovation
In our pursuit of setting industry benchmarks for responsible and child-friendly digital advertising, Kidoz not only rigorously ensured its advertising platform met stricter GDPR-K compliance standards but also implemented an exhaustive manual review process.
Every campaign and ad creative submitted to our network is meticulously examined by our dedicated in-house team
. This hands-on approach ensures that all advertisements are not only relevant and appropriate for our young audience but also fully compliant with the strictest privacy standards.
Following this manual filtration our system is intricately designed to automatically
filter out any campaign or ad creative that could potentially collect personal information
, such as names, birth dates, email addresses, or locations. This comprehensive review process ensures all advertisements are relevant, appropriate for our young audience, and strictly adhere to privacy regulations. By integrating this dual-layered approach—combining automated safeguards with human oversight—Kidoz underscores its unwavering commitment to creating a secure and nurturing digital environment, completely free of privacy concerns.
COPPA and GDPRkids™ Compliance
In our dedication to exceed the standard requirements for children's online privacy, the Kidoz team has proactively sought and attained oversight from an FTC-approved
COPPA Safe Harbor
through
PRIVO
, affirming our platform's compliance with the stringent measures designed to protect children aged 13 and under.
Furthering our commitment to global privacy standards, Kidoz has also become a proud participant in
GDPR
kids
™ Privacy Assured Program
. This initiative aligns with the GDPR's nuanced approach to children's privacy, recognizing the varying ages of consent across EU member states and the UK, which range from 13 to 16 years old.

I.1 We are Bytedance Pte. Ltd., a company incorporated in Singapore whose registered office is at 1 Raffles Quay, #26-10 ,Singapore 048583 (" we", "our" or " us"). This Pangle End User Data Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains who we are, how we collect, process, store, use, transfer, share, and disclose ("process") personal data about you, and how you can exercise your data privacy rights.
I.2 It is the Partner’s responsibility to inform you of Pangle’s use of your data (i.e. by directing you to this policy) and to acquire all consent necessary for Pangle’s use of your data. We will process your personal data on the basis that your personal data is required for us to provide our services to the Partner under the relevant contract between us and the Partner.
I.3 If you have any questions or concerns about our processing of your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
II. What is Pangle?
II.1 Pangle is a mobile advertising platform, including support systems and services operated by Bytedance and accessible via www.pangleglobal.com ("Pangle"). Pangle enables advertisers to serve advertisements on third party mobile applications and/or websites owned or operated by a Partner or to which a Partner has the right to serve advertising (each a“Partner Site”). We do this by processing certain information collected from those Partner Sites, as described in this Privacy Policy.
III. What personal data we process
III.1 The types of personal data that we process depend on the circumstances of collection and on the nature of the services requested or transaction undertaken for our Partners.
III.2 When you interact with a Partner Site, we process certain information about you and your device. This information may be collected automatically from your device using our software code (referred to as a "software development kit", or "SDK"), or shared with us by other advertising exchanges (e.g. Google DoubleClick). We also use cookies (text files inserted in your browser when you visit our partners or customers' mobile applications and websites) and other tracking technologies available on your device.
III.3 The information that we process about you may include some or all of the following categories:
a. Information obtained automatically from your device
i. Identifiers: We may process device-specific identifiers such as your IP address, mobile advertising identifier (such as the "Google Advertising ID" on Android phones or the "ID for Advertisers" on iOS devices), or a Pangle-specific identifier which our SDK has assigned to your device. A mobile advertising identifier is an identifier that is provided by your device operating system and allows companies, like Pangle, to recognize your device across apps for advertising purposes. In addition to the mobile advertising identifier, and other similar technologies, Pangle may also obtain your device's model, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), your device's language settings, general geographic region, time zone, network type (such as 5G or WiFi), your ROM version, screen resolution (to know which ads which will appear best on your device), mobile country code and mobile network code, and the time your device was last updated and started.
ii. Geolocation data: We may infer your approximate geo-location from your device s IP address. We may also process your precise latitude and longitude using your phone s GPS data, where we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to do so in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
iii. Internet activity: We may process information about your app and website usage, including the name and version of the app or website that has integrated Pangle. We may also process information about your interactions with any advertisements we deliver (e.g. information about the advertisements served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where and when the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser s website or downloaded the advertiser s app, as well as any preferences you may have expressed in respect of that advertisement).
b. Information obtained from other sources
i. From time to time, we may receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive information about you from third parties, such as advertising exchanges that share data with us for the purposes of serving advertising, if third parties are legally permitted to disclose this information to us.
ii. The information we receive from these sources may include identifiers (such as your IP address or mobile advertising identifier), information about your Internet activity (such as information about your interaction with third party websites, applications and advertisements) and inferences relating to your preferences and characteristics (e.g. your approximate age and gender).
IV.How we use personal data
IV.1 We use personal data to serve you with personalised advertisements and understand the audiences who see the advertisements we serve. Specifically, we process personal data for the following purposes:
a. To serve you advertisements: To enable third party advertisers to bid on and fill advertising space on Partner Apps with their advertising. We use your mobile advertising identifier, together with the other device identifiers described above, to serve you with personalised advertising and for related purposes such as frequency capping (limiting the number of times you see the same ad), attribution (making sure we get paid by advertisers for the advertisements we deliver), and fraud detection (detecting malicious software, or "bots", that generate false interactions with advertisements to drive fraudulent advertising revenues). We also use your device data to ensure we display advertisements that display properly on your device.
b. To personalise the advertisements we show you: To infer your interests from the types of apps you use and the adverts you interact with, as well as to infer certain demographic information about you (such as your age and gender) so we can show you advertisements that are more relevant to you;
c. To serve you advertisements on the basis of your location: To serve you advertisements that are relevant for your region and displayed in the relevant local language, as well as to better understand the audiences who see our advertisements, based on your current or prior location, including through location-based targeting segments created by us or by our third party advertisers.
d. For auditing and reporting: To verify accurate delivery of, and count the number of end users who see and interact with, advertisements we serve on behalf of our advertisers and what ad campaigns led to further consumer activity (such as a purchase, app install or visit) (sometimes called "attribution"). We use this information to report to our advertisers about the advertisements users have seen and interacted with, so that we and our publishers are paid appropriately for the advertisements we display.
e. To provide campaign analytics to advertisers: To provide advertisers information about how well their campaigns perform, whether relative to their prior campaigns, or bench-marked against third party campaigns or other data.
f. For cross-device targeting: To "link" or "resolve" the same user across their various devices (such as across mobile devices, browsers and tablets). For instance, we (or a third party partner we work with) may help an advertiser "find" a consumer they have engaged with previously on a mobile device when that consumer is browsing on their tablet, in order to target ads to the user across those devices.
g. To detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for such activities: For example, to identify invalid clicks (or advertising queries) and protect us and our advertisers from fraudulent behaviour.
h. To verify or maintain the quality of Pangle and improve, upgrade or enhance Pangle: For example, (i) for audit, research, and analysis of the information in order to maintain, improve, upgrade or enhance our advertising services, and to ensure that our technologies function properly; and (ii) other internal operations, such as debugging, support, and security.
i. For compliance with legal obligations: To comply with legal obligations that apply to us, for example to respond to law enforcement requests.
j. For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes.
k. For any other purpose to which you consent: To use your personal data for any other purpose to which you have provided consent.
IV.2 In general, we will process personal data only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or for purposes that are explained to you at the time your personal data is collected. However, we may also use your personal data for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws.
V. Who we share your personal data with
V.1 We may share your personal data for the purposes described above in this Privacy Policy with the following categories of recipients:
a Our advertising partners and platforms: We may share personal data with our
advertising partners
(such as DSPs) and partner platforms (such as
TikTok for Business
) in connection with their bidding on the ad opportunity and optimizing their ad bidding systems and ad biddingÅ strategies, so as to target and display advertisements on Publisher Partner Apps on behalf of advertisers.
b. Our advertisers: We also share limited personal data in aggregated form with our advertising partners, through reports about the kinds of people seeing their advertisements and how their advertisements are performing (for example, that an ad was seen by 100 men between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Singapore and like football). Aggregated data cannot by itself can be used to contact you or identify your name. We also report to our advertising partners which Pangle advertisements resulted in you making a purchase or taking an action with an advertiser.
c. Partners: We share aggregated data with Partners through reports about the types of advertisements served to their apps, in order that they can measure the effectiveness and value of our services. As these reports are aggregated they do not reveal any information that directly identifies you.
d. Our affiliates, corporate group and third party service providers: We share personal data with our affiliates and other companies, including other Bytedance entities, who help us operate our business, perform functions on our behalf or provide services to us, including data processing services to us (for example, to support, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the accuracy, safety and security of our services, or to provide analytics or attribution services to us, as well as service providers who provide technical, customer, hosting, data hygiene and enhancement or operational support), as well as other professional advisors. We may also share personal data with members of our corporate group to improve their ads systems and processes, to help them deliver more relevant ads to you and to reach you on non-Bytedance properties.
e. Our analytics and attribution partners: We share personal data with our analytics and attribution partners who help us monitor the success of our advertising campaigns (such as how many end users saw and clicked on an advertisement) and provide reporting to our advertisers.
f. Any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party: We may share personal data with these parties where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation; (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights; (iii) to detect and protect against fraud or other security or technical vulnerabilities; (iv) to respond to an emergency; or (v) to otherwise protect your vital interests or those of any other person where permitted by applicable law.
g. Any other person: We will only share personal data with any other person with your consent to the disclosure or as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection law.
VI. How we keep your personal data secure
VI.1 We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data that we process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data.
VII. International data transfers
VII.1 Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located or in which your personal data was collected. However, we will not transfer or permit any of your personal data to be transferred outside of such country unless we have taken measures necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable laws, and in any case to a recipient that has comparable privacy protections in place.
VII.2 Specifically, our servers are located in the United States of America and Singapore, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that we may process your personal data in any of these countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
VIII. Data retention
VIII.1 We retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to provide you with services so that we can fulfil our contractual obligations and exercise our rights in relation to the information involved. Where we do not need your information in order to provide services to you, we retain it only for so long as we have a legitimate business purpose in keeping such data or as necessary to comply with the law.
VIII.2 When we have no ongoing legitimate business or legal need to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives or the law requires otherwise), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
IX. Targeted ads and your right to opt-out
Our partners use the Pangle SDK for the purpose of serving targeted ads to you. To do this, Pangle receives and processes device information such as cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, IP addresses, user agent information and browsing or app data where the SDK is installed. Pangle uses this device information to identify your device and deliver relevant ads to you.
IX.1 Opt-out
You can opt out of ads that are targeted based on data Pangle previously received about you by clicking
Ad label
. Pangle's ability to opt you out of targeted ads depends on our ability to recognize your device. As device and connection information can change frequently, we encourage you to revisit this page periodically to ensure your opt-outs are up to date.
IX.2 Non-targeted ads
If you opt out of targeted ads, Pangle will stop showing ads based on data it previously collected and can link to your device. However, Pangle may still show you ads based on data it receives about the context of the app or website you are visiting (e.g. sports advertisements in a sports app) or your device (ads for iPhone users or Android users).
X. Your data protection rights
X.1 Pangle supports the exercise of your data protection rights which may be available in your country in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Specifically:

We only process Users’ data when we have a legal basis to do so, in any of the following circumstances:

We do not process a User’s data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on the User (unless we have their consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

How do we safeguard children’s privacy?
AwesomeAds Marketplace enables publishers to receive Ads secure in the knowledge that their users – including children – are protected from the risks associated with online profiling and interest-based targeting, and that they (the publishers) are serving Ads in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K.
AwesomeAds Marketplace does this by deploying a proprietary process specifically designed to minimise our interaction with End User data, and to prevent such interaction by third parties involved in delivering Ads. This process entails the use of de-identified data when delivering Ads and monitoring their performance. For more information, see
How do we process End Users’ data?
All Ads delivered by AwesomeAds Marketplace carry the SuperAwesome ‘SAFE AD’ watermark:
The watermark signifies that delivery of the Ad involves no cookie-based targeting or behavioural tracking – in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K – and each Ad creative has been reviewed for compliance with SuperAwesome’s advertising policies.
COPPA-compliant contextual targeting technology
AwesomeAds Marketplace’s proprietary contextual targeting technology is certified under the following COPPA Safe Harbor Programs approved by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC):
the kidSAFE Seal Program:
the ESRB Privacy Certified Program:
the CARU COPPA Safe Harbor Program:

What End User data do we process?
The data we process from End Users is limited to specific technical data relating to the device on which the End User is viewing and engaging with an Ad served by AwesomeAds Marketplace. We refer to this data as
Device Data
.
Device Data
is defined as follows:
If an End User sees the Ad on a
mobile app
, their Device Data consists of the device’s user agent string, IP address and the app’s BundleID (e.g. “com.acme.bestgamever”) from the End User’s mobile device
If an End User sees the Ad on a
web browser
, their Device Data consists of the device’s user agent string, IP address and the site’s web domain address (e.g. “www.website.com”) where the Ad is shown
If an End User interacts with an Ad that includes augmented reality features, Device Data will include device type (e.g. phone or tablet) and browser information. We will ask for permission to access the device camera to enable a filter or overlay, but do not collect or share any images captured by the End User’s device.
How do we process End Users’ data?
The only End Users’ data we process is Device Data. In all cases we are strong advocates of data minimisation with regard to Device Data – even if some of that data is not personal data.
We process End Users’ Device Data as follows:
We generate a de-identified Marker
We observe the Device Data momentarily, and only in order to immediately transform it into a temporary custom identifier called a
Marker
. A Marker is a temporary, unique, one-way hashed value that cannot be reverse engineered to identify a particular individual.
Our Marker was designed specifically to enable AwesomeAds Marketplace to deliver Ads without SuperAwesome or any third party storing the personal data of End Users, which could be used to build online profiles for behavioural advertising, or other purposes that are not in compliance with data privacy laws regarding children.
By using a Marker, we do not need to retain or process Device Data in its original form.
To create the Marker:
We obfuscate the Device Data by injecting randomised characters into it and then run the resultant string through an algorithm which creates the Marker
The Device Data is not stored by SuperAwesome and is used only within the SDK
We discard the Marker when each Ad campaign has ended, or at month end, whichever occurs first
Third party Ad measurement
We may provide limited third-party access to Device Data for Ad measurement purposes, as explained in
How do we share Users’ data?
What is our legal basis for processing End Users’ data?
The following tables outline the purposes for which we may process End Users’ data, the legal bases we rely on to do so, and what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.

web domain
These elements cannot be used to identify an individual.
There is no permanent retention of End Users’ personal data within AwesomeAds Marketplace (or by SuperAwesome). An End Users’ Device Data is observed by us only momentarily, as further explained in
How do we process End Users’ data
? above.
5. What do we do with Authorised Users’ data?
An
Authorised User
is an individual who uses the Dashboard to manage advertising campaigns on behalf of our Customers.
What Authorised User data do we process?
To enable an Authorised User to access the Dashboard, we process their first name, last name, corporate email address, and Dashboard password.
When an Authorised User interacts with the Dashboard, we process technical data about their equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns on the Dashboard. We collect this data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies.
We process aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data of Authorised Users to monitor and improve the performance and features of the AwesomeAds Marketplace.
What is our legal basis for processing Authorised Users’ data?
This table outlines the purposes for which we may process certain types of Authorised Users’ data, the legal bases we rely on to do so, and what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.

Necessary for our legitimate interests to operate, maintain and improve AwesomeAds Marketplace
How long do we retain Authorised Users’ data?
SuperAwesome retains personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements or protecting our rights.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Authorised Users’ data, we consider:
the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data
the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of the data
the purposes for which we process the data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means
applicable legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements
We only retain the data of Authorised Users for the life of the Customer relationship with SuperAwesome or until deletion is requested either by the Customer or the Authorised User, or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
We may retain an Authorised User’s data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with the Customer or the Authorised User.
Marketing
We do not normally send marketing materials to Authorised Users unless they have opted in to receive marketing from SuperAwesome through other channels. From time to time, Authorised Users receive service information updates via the Dashboard.
Cookies
We use Google Analytics on the Dashboard. Google Analytics places a cookie on Authorised Users’ devices. As an Authorised User, you can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.
If you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of the Dashboard may become inaccessible or not function properly.
6. What do we do with general enquiry and subscribers’ data?
When someone enquires about our products or services, subscribes to our service or publications, or gives us feedback, we process the personal data which they have provided (e.g. name and email address) to respond to them.
7. How do we share Users’ data?
Sharing Users’ data with third-party providers
SuperAwesome uses a small number of third-party service providers to help us provide the AwesomeAds Marketplace to Users. Some of these providers may process Users’ data on our behalf.
For example:
We use a third party to host AwesomeAds Marketplace
We use third party tools to help us better understand how Customers and Authorised Users navigate across the Dashboard
We use service providers to support our internal operations, and who may process Device Data to measure the effectiveness of an Ad. For example, to support fraud detection (by determining invalid traffic such as bots), verification of impressions, and measuring how much of an Ad was ‘viewable’
We enter into contractual arrangements with our service providers to ensure that they are only processing your data in a lawful manner and strictly for the foregoing purposes. It may not be used or shared for any other purposes, including for behavioural advertising or to amass a profile on a User.
We maintain a current list of providers
here.
To learn more about how our third-party data processors use Users’ data, please refer to their privacy policies.
Sharing Users’ data within SuperAwesome
We may share a User’s data within the SuperAwesome group of companies and other third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, the new owners may process a User’s data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.
Sharing Users’ data for other reasons
We may disclose a User’s data for any of the following reasons:
in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law
if doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process
to permit us to pursue available remedies, including commencing or responding to any claims
to enforce the terms and conditions of AwesomeAds Marketplace
to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SuperAwesome or the public
to prevent other illegal activity
for risk management purposes
8. How do we transfer Users’ data internationally?
We may transfer Users’ data in the following ways:
We share Users’ data within the SuperAwesome group of companies. This involves transferring Users’ data outside the UK and EEA.
Some of our third-party data processors are based outside the UK and EEA so their processing of Users’ data may involve a transfer of Users’ data outside the UK and EEA.
Whenever we authorise a transfer of Users’ data outside of the UK and EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using specific contracting frameworks approved by the UK Government and European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK and EEA. If you require further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring Users’ data outside of the UK or EEA, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
9. How do we secure Users’ data?
SuperAwesome values your trust and strives to maintain adequate security measures for all areas of our business and our services. Because AwesomeAds Marketplace is a service that operates digitally, SuperAwesome is continuously reviewing and improving its security measures to prevent data breaches and security incidents.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent Users’ data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
We limit access to Users’ data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties strictly on a “need to know” basis. They only process Users’ data on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Third party websites, services and apps
Some of the correspondence Authorised Users receive from us may contain links to third party websites, online services or mobile applications that are not affiliated with or operated by us, including those of the Customers who use AwesomeAds Marketplace. While SuperAwesome tries to link only to websites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible and accept no liability for the content, security or privacy practices of those other websites.
To find out how your personal data may be used by third party websites, refer to the privacy and cookie policies displayed on those websites.
10. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your
personal data
. For example, you may have rights to:
Review/access/delete/restrict the collection
of your child’s personal data. Under COPPA, a parent has certain rights over how we handle the personal data of an End User who is their child. This includes the right for a parent to review, access, or delete the personal data that has been collected by us from that End User, and to refuse at any time to permit the collection from that End User of such personal data.
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances, such as where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You may also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons of which you will be notified, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You may also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy
where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent as the legal basis upon which to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
If you are a California resident, please refer to the California residents section below for more information on your legal rights.
No fee usually required
You do not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Do Not Track disclosure
Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (
DNT
) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, AwesomeAds Marketplace does not support and does not act on DNT signal headers that we may receive.
11. Location-specific privacy rules
Depending on where you are resident, specific privacy rules apply:

1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
These
FAQs
provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Privacy Policy (below). They enhance rather than replace the important notices in this Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.
What’s new as of December 4, 2024?
On December 4, 2024, we updated our position with LevelPlay from a “Data Processor” to a “Data Controller”. We also made some formatting updates, updated our Third Party Partners list.
The difference between an edit/review and an update is that "updates" involve material changes to our Policy whereas edits are not material or simply indicate a review has occurred. For example, we may make clarifying edits by giving additional examples. When we provide an update, you will receive a notice to accept and read the changes, which are summarized here.

6. Our Policies Concerning Children
Unity Struckd
If the user is a child, we may collect and store the below information solely for our internal operations and our legitimate interest:
IP address
Unique Installation-specific ID
Randomly generated User ID
Vendor ID
Device ID
We collect the above information
for internal analytics to understand the service and e.g., why an error is occuring in Struckd or what causes users to engage with Struckd
so that we can send push notification
so that we can make updates to the application without needing to push an update
We may share some of this information with our service providers who we contract with to help us provide our services to you. Please note, while we collect country and birth date, this information is not stored.
Unity Advertising  Services
Developers using Unity’s Advertising Services may offer any of the following three categories of applications: 1) child-directed (Users are likely children), 2) mixed audience (Users are both children and non-children), 3) non-child directed (Users are unlikely to be children). If the application is a mixed audience, the Developer should implement an age-gate where required by law, and send a signal to Unity which indicates that we need to limit data collection, serve non-personalized ads, or otherwise disable the service. The Developer similarly categorizes applications which are specifically child-directed. A child is considered to be any User under the age of consent in their applicable jurisdiction.
In connection with the Ads Service, in the event we receive a signal from a Developer, we reduce our data collection for our Ads Service. In such instances, we will only collect Personal Information listed below. We collect this Personal Information for internal operations and our legitimate interests in providing the Service.
IP address is used to provide a compliant experience suitable for the User’s region.
Unique Installation-specific ID is used for operational purposes related to the serving of contextual advertisements.
User ID is used in connection with providing rewards in exchange for watching an ad. Unity uses a developer-set identification (User ID) to let the Developer know when a User with the User ID has completed the watched the ad and is therefore entitled to receive the in-game reward (coin, gems, etc.).
In connection with the Unity Rewards service, in the event we receive a signal from a Developer, we will collect and maintain a service-specific identifier associated with the Developer’s application in order to enable a service block since the Unity Rewards service is not intended for children.
Our Services are otherwise not intended for children. If you are aware that our Services are otherwise collecting Personal Information about children, please contact us at
DPO@unity3d.com
If you or your parent or guardian have questions about this policy or how we use your personal information, you can contact us at
DPO@unity3d.com
.

9. Transfers out of Country of Collection
Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of Personal Information outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the UK and/or EEA.
Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of Personal Information outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the UK and/or EEA.
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have
facilities
, including
ironSource
which is headquartered in Israel, or in which we engage service providers, such as Google Cloud Platform and Looker, and by using the Services you understand that your Personal Information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.
Where this will involve transferring your Personal Information outside the UK and/or EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
Adequacy Decisions:
Some non-EEA countries are recognized under the UK GDPR and by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available
here
). For example, we may transfer to our affiliates who are located around the world, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Standard Contractual Clauses:
For transfers of Personal Information from the UK and/or EEA to third countries, which are not considered adequate under the UK GDPR and/or by the European Commission, we have put in place standard contractual clauses adopted under the UK GDPR and/or by the European Commission to protect your Personal Information. For example, we use Google Cloud Platform’s infrastructure and data centers which are located around the world, including the United States. We rely on both controller-controller and controller-processor Standard Contractual Clauses. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting us in accordance with the “
Contacting Us
” section below. “
UK GDPR
” has the meaning given to it in section 3(10) (as supplemented by section 205(4)) of the Data Protection Act 2018.
Japan
For transfers from Japan to countries other than the EEA/UK, we have put adequate measures in place to protect your Personal Information.
The transferees are obligated to comply with equivalent or comparable rules to those under the Act on the Protection of Personal Information of Japan (APPI) on a continuous basis, and we periodically confirm their compliance. We also periodically confirm any changes to the data privacy regulations of other countries that may affect the compliance measures taken by our overseas affiliates and third-party service providers and take measures such as requesting that they take corrective measures or suspending the provision of Personal Information if any issues arise in the implementation of such compliance measures. We will provide you with further information on the measures we take in this regard upon your request.
10. Retention
We retain Personal Information for as long as is necessary or as permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law, for example, for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. The criteria to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
Where a legal obligation arises or retention is advisable in light of our legal position, in some circumstances, we will retain certain Personal Information, even after your account has been deleted and/or we no longer provide the Services to you; for example:
To cooperate with law enforcement or public, regulatory and government authorities: If we receive a preservation order or search warrant, related to your Services account, we will preserve Personal Information subject to such order or warrant after you delete your Services account.
To comply with legal provisions on tax and accounting: We may retain your Personal Information after you delete your Personal Information, as required by tax law and to comply with bookkeeping requirements. Please note the length of time may vary by country.
For fraud and security purposes: We may retain your Personal Information for fraud/ security purposes such as IP address, User ID, Device ID, and unique app installation-specific ID, which can be used to investigate whether a specific device exhibits a pattern of abnormal app interaction behavior, which may indicate a malicious bot or fraudulent actor.
To pursue or defend a legal action: We may retain relevant Personal Information in the event of a legal claim or complaint, including regulatory investigations or legal proceedings about a claim related to your Personal Information, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation (whether in respect of our relationship with you or otherwise) after the dispute has been settled or decided by a court or tribunal from which there is no further right of appeal. The criteria for determining the length of time we will retain this information include:
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, if the settlement or decision requires us to keep the records for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
11. Security
We employ a variety of measures to safeguard the collection, transmission, and storage of the information we collect. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process, and store, and the current state of technology. Please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the
“Contact Us”
section below
12. Biometric Information
Please note, Unity is a data processor for information uploaded through Safe Voice, which, depending on legal interpretation, may be considered biometric data. The following Section contains legal information which is only applicable under U.S. Law.
Your use of certain features may result in the collection of biometric information. Biometric information is any information based on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual. Biometric information that may be collected depending on how you use Unity's products includes voice recordings. For example, if you are using Unity Safe Voice for in-app voice communication, that may be considered to be collecting biometric information under applicable laws.
We use commercially reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative methods designed to protect biometric information within our organization.
We retain biometric information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purposes stated in this policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by applicable law. For more information on the criteria used to determine our retention periods, please see the "
Retention
" section in our Privacy Policy.
We will destroy or dispose of your biometric information as required by applicable law. For example, we may destroy electronic records of biometric information through such processes as overwriting magnetic media, degaussing, or physical destruction, and we may dispose of paper records by such processes as shredding or incineration.
Please note you may need to make your request for deletion through Unity’s customer as we may need our customer’s assistance to locate your account.
13. Unity Ads Privacy Features and Third Party Partners in Providing Advertising
Privacy Features
If Unity delivers personalized advertising through its ad network, Unity will provide notice and information about how you may be able to opt-out of such personalized advertisements. Please note that the limitations available to you are determined by the laws within your jurisdiction and the tools the Developer chooses to implement. Such an opportunity to opt out may occur through your device settings (see the section “Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices” in our
Cookie & Advertising Policy
and the choices available within the ad unit as described in this Policy by accessing the Data Privacy icon in the ad unit.
Developer Advertising Using Other Ad Networks
Developers may use other third-party advertising networks, and Unity’s choice features within its ad units only apply to ads delivered in the Unity network.
Please note that the Developer of the app showing Unity Ads may have limited choices in providing certain identifying information, including your device advertising ID, about you to our third-party partners advertising goods and services with Unity. You may still see ads from the partners listed below, but they will not be based on your Personal Information. Additionally, you may have opted-out of profiling in Unity’s ad network within a Unity Ad for your app, in which case we will only serve contextual ads from ourselves and these partners within your app. For all others, please review the following information:
Third Party Ad Network Partners
The following third-party partners may receive an ad request from Unity containing your Personal Information. This list may be updated from time to time.

When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your Personal Information will be collected by such a third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps or our Social Media Pages.

Our Privacy Principles for the use of data about Targeted End Users
Liftoff’s systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents. For instance: users with iPhone X’s in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times.
Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user’s consent. For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.
Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app. E.g. user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.
This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps.
Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising. Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the user’s consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.
Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data
Details of how to opt-out of interest-based advertising from us can be found at:

V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be collected, transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located, including the United States and other countries where we or our group companies or service providers (among others) maintain facilities. Our group affiliates and our third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. We maintain primary data centers in the United States, Singapore, Japan and Germany. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Privacy Policy and according to applicable law.
We have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, including by entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal information, or where required, we will ask you for your prior written consent for such international data transfers.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland which have been formally recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” and “adequacy regulations” from the European Commission, Swiss and UK authorities.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. These safeguards include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021 under Article 46(2) GDPR for transfers originating in the EEA, UK and Switzerland; and the UK Addendum under Article 46(2) of the UK GDPR for the transfer of data originating in the UK.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses entered into by our group companies and with our third-party service providers and partners can be provided on request. Please note that some sensitive commercial information will be redacted. If you have any questions or concerns related to international data transfers, please contact us via the contact details set out below.

If you are located in the EEA, UK (inc. Gibraltar) or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the personal information that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles.

In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You will be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is necessary and related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information that we collect through the Site and Services. If you have any questions about these practices, please contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
Service Providers
We employ third party companies and people, for example cloud service providers (“Third Party Service Providers”), such as Amazon Web Services, Dropbox, Salesforce and
Unity Technologies
to perform tasks e.g., provide computer and network infrastructure services on our behalf or as advertising exchange partners and we may need to share your information with them to provide products or Services to you. We only share your personal information with Third Party Service Providers to the extent necessary for them to assist us and they do not have any right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also work with Google to deliver the best advertising opportunities to its clients through the use of remarketing tags. Traffic Clients and other data subjects can consult Google’s policies to learn more about Google’s processing policies

Third Party Digital Advertising Partners
If you are a Targeted End User, we will share data about you with Partners, to be used by those Partners for advertising-related purposes, including establishing (on behalf of advertisers) whether to bid on the opportunity to show you ads. When we share data in this manner, we will also share with the relevant Partner details about whether you have consented to, or objected to, the use of your data by the Partner for specified purposes.
Group Companies
We may provide your personal information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf to provide the Site and the Services to you. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information.
Compliance with laws and legal proceedings
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
Merger or Acquisition
If Liftoff Mobile, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
VII. SECURITY
The security of your personal information is important to us.  Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us
We take appropriate steps to pseudonymize your personal information. For Targeted End Users, the advertising device IDs (which are the only per-user identifiers that we track, and can be reset by the user at any time) are SHA1-hashed before insertion. Since SHA1 is a one-way hashing algorithm, the original raw advertising device ID cannot be reverse-engineered from the hashed version.
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
VIII. DATA RETENTION
If you have provided us with personal information for the purposes of holding an account with us, we will retain your information (including personal information) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.
If we hold information about you through any other means we shall only process this information for as long as is necessary for the purpose and in any event for no longer than 28 days.
Information relating to Targeted End Users is retained for 30 days in pseudonymized form before it is automatically deleted from our active database. Backups are stored indefinitely.
We will delete it after the timescales stated above, except we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
IX. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
We perform the following automated decision-making processes using your personal information:
To build lookalike targeting models to target users who are similar to the Customer’s existing users. Our Machine Learning does this automatically for every Customer. The more upfront device IDs Liftoff has, the more beneficial this is.
For power predictive ML features e.g. users who have purchased in the past are much more likely to purchase again in the future
To exclude existing users from User Acquisition campaigns, and power targeting rules for re-engagement campaigns e.g. target users who have registered but not purchased.
We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal data is subject to automated decision-making. Our technical and organizational security measures can be provided on request.
When we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contacting us using the contact details provided under Section IV titled “Complaints, Questions and Suggestions”.
