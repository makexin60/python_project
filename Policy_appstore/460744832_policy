I try to treat you well
I hate spam and invasions of privacy, so I try my best to
	treat others the way I would wish to be treated myself.
This app does not collect any personal data.
Analytics
If you have allowed Apple to collect anonymous usage data and crash reports then Apple may share
	that information with me.
It helps me fix bugs more easily and lets me know if people are using my app (which encourages me to carry on development).
You can opt-in or opt-out of this on your iOS device's Settings app: Privacy -> Analytics -> Share With App Developers.

Please use Word Helper responsibly.  If you are playing an online game
				of Scrabble / Lexulous / Words With Friends it's courteous to let the other player know if you are using a helper.  


				Please don't use a Helper, Cheat or Solver to cheat at Scrabble, Lexulous or Words With Friends.  You'll
				have much more fun if you use it in practice games to learn how to improve your game and get better
				at playing word games in general.

				If Word Helper suggests a word you don't know, you can click on the word to look it up in a
				dictionary so you're enriching your vocabulary.
				Be nice to each other, give freely, and it will come back to you :-)
