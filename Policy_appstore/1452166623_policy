Privacy Policy
​
Last Updated: March 10, 2025
​
​
Thank you for using Lark products and services. We are committed to protecting your privacy through our compliance with this Policy.
​
​
Lark offers an online, multi-tool business management, efficiency, and communications platform and standalone applications including but not limited to instant messaging services, content creation and collaboration, cloud storage, calendar services, audio and video calls, email services, and other functions, as well as services that interoperate with other software (collectively, the “
Platform
”). The Platform and its related services, products, sub-applications within the Platform, standalone applications associated with the Platform, software program and content are collectively referred to herein as the “
Services.
”
​
The Services are provided or controlled by (i) Lark Technologies Pte. Ltd. (located at 1 Raffles Quay, #26-10, South Tower, Singapore 048583) if you are accessing the Services outside the U.S.; or (ii) Lark Enterprise Applications Inc. (located at 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware 19808) if you are accessing the Platform from inside the U.S. (collectively, “
we
” or “
us
”).
​
​
This privacy policy (“
Policy
”) sets out the basis on which your data will be processed, collected, used, and disclosed by us when you access or use our Services, together with all related services, products, software programs and content we provide, including any other services where this Policy is shown. For further information about the applicability of the Policy, please see the section “
How Does This Policy Apply
”.
​
​
Please read the following carefully to understand our approach and practices regarding the processing of your information. For the purposes of this Policy, we use “information”, “personal information” and “personal data” to refer to information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. We also use the term “
Business Workplace Owner
” to refer to accounts owned by (i) a corporate entity or (ii) a third party who uses it for non-personal purposes.
​
​
How Does This Policy Apply?
​
Under certain data protection laws, a party is either a controller or a processor of data. In general, we are the controller of the information described in the “Types of Information We Collect and Use” section. However, in certain situations, we act as a processor. For example, if a Business Workplace Owner invites you to create an account for its business purposes and you use the Services as an authorized user of its Workplace (“
Authorized Business User Account
”), we are a processor and the Business Workplace Owner is the controller of “Workplace Data” you generate when you are signed into your Authorized Business User Account. This data and any other data the Business Workplace Owner may control are referred to herein as “
Business
Owner Controlled Data
.” Please note that this Policy
does not
cover the processing of Business Owner Controlled Data unless such data is shared with us by the Business Workplace Owner as the data controller. Such processing is primarily covered by the Business Workplace Owner’s privacy policy, a separate agreement between the Business Workplace Owner and Lark which governs delivery, access and use of the Services and/or the employment agreement (or any agreement in lieu of the employment agreement) between you and the Business Workplace Owner.
​
​
Please note that Business Owner Controlled Data does not include Workplace Data that you generate when you are signed into your personal account, even when you interact with Workplaces associated with Business Workplace Owners. Additionally, upon termination of your Authorized Business User Account by a Business Workplace Owner, Lark will automatically convert your Authorized Business User Account to a personal account. If you continue to use the Services when signed into personal account, we will then generally be the controller of the data associated with that personal account, including Workplace Data.
​
​
Types of Information We Collect and Use
​
We may collect and use the following types of information when you access the Platform or use the Services:
​
Account Data.
To create an account, you or a Business Workplace Owner may give us your name, photo, phone number, email address, password information, and/or similar account details. In addition, if you use a paid version of the Services or certain portions of our Services that enable purchases (e.g., food or car services purchases), we will collect billing details from you or a Business Workplace Owner, including credit card information, banking information and/or billing address.
​
Workplace Data.

);
​

•
data about the device you are using to access the Services and related device activity, such as mobile carrier, device IDs, and operating system version; and
​

•
data regarding your communications with us, for example, when you provide us with feedback or contact us with a question or comment through our chat or call services (including on social media).
​
Location Data.
We collect and process information about your location including general location information (e.g., city, state, country and/or zip code) based on your SIM card, IP address, or other device information. With your permission, we may also collect your precise location and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. You may switch off GPS and location information in your system settings. If you choose to share your location with us and consent to our use of this data, we may process this information to provide you with relevant services based on location.
​
Third Party Data.
Lark permits the integration of other services and applications with our Services. If you are using an integrated third-party service, we may receive and process data from that third party (and will also share certain data with that third party, including data described in the above) in order to provide the integrated service.
​
This Policy does not apply to the processing of your information by third-parties through your use of any third-party integrations available via our services.
When using integrated apps and services on Lark, please always review the relevant third-party provider’s legal documents including but not limited to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
.
​
Additional Business Owner Controlled Data.
We may receive information (including data from the categories described above) that we only collect and process when a Business Workplace Owner chooses to use certain features available to those accounts and upon the Business Workplace Owner’s instruction. For example, a Business Workplace Owner may enable features related to (i) attendance, approval, health report, buzz, and log functions; (ii) business directory services; (iii) third-party integrations; and/or (iv) precise geolocation services, including via cell tower triangulation. As set forth in the “How Does This Policy Apply” section, we are a processor of this Business Owner Controlled Data and the Business Workplace Owner—not Lark—must ensure that they have appropriate legal grounds (including, where required, your consent) before collecting, using, and disclosing such data.

How Does This Policy Apply?
​
Under Japanese data protection laws, there is no distinction between a controller or a processor of data. As a business who handles personal information, we are subject to the data protection laws, including in respect of the information described in the “Types of Information We Collect and Use” section and in respect of Business Owner Controlled Data as it is defined in this Policy. However, we note that this Policy does not cover the processing of Business Owner Controlled Data unless such data is shared with us by the Business Workplace Owner. Making information about the handling of Business Owner Controlled Data accessible to you is the responsibility of Business Workplace Owners, since it constitutes "retained personal data" (
保有個人データ
) over which they have authority under Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information.
​
​
Such processing is primarily covered by the Business Workplace Owner’s privacy policy, a separate agreement between the Business Workplace Owner and Lark which governs delivery, access and use of the Services and/or the employment agreement (or any agreement in lieu of the employment agreement) between you and the Business Workplace Owner.
