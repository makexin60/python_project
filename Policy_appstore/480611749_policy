About eduroam
eduroam
provides users with authenticated network logon and access to the internet through a single wifi profile and set of credentials, wherever the service has been made available by participating organisations. Connection can be seamless and automatic. Wired connections can also be supported.
By eduroam-enabling the network, organisations can provide guest network access services to visitors without the need for guest account management, saving time and cost for both the organisation and the visitor.
Participating organisations, using their existing infrastructures, connect to national NREN-operated RADIUS systems and overlay eduroam network services, which adhere to comprehensive technical standards.

Download the eduroam companion app
Show
eduroam users can now more easily locate eduroam-enabled sites thanks to an app for iPhone, iPad and Android devices.
The app is free, and the iOS version is available on the
App Store
, while the Android version is available from a number of sources, including the
Google Play store
.
About the app
The 'eduroam companion’ app helps users to locate their nearest eduroam point by visualising the central database of eduroam-enabled facilities on a map and provides information that the user will need in order to connect to the service.
Since the app taps into the central
eduroam.org
database, details of services throughout a number of participating countries are available. There are some countries that do not provide data to the eduroam.org database, so coverage is not total. Equally, not all organisations provide similarly comprehensive data sets of where they provide service.
In order to address this issue, a feature has been built in which enables users to contribute to the accuracy of service coverage information - the app allows users to tag locations where they find eduroam. Once the minimum threshold of tags have been received for a hotspot, a new location marker is created.

When you use eduroam when roaming away from your home organisation, we will collect an identifier of your device ('calling-station-identifier') and the time stamp of any connection attempt. Whilst not personally identifiable information, we will also collect an identifier of the organisation providing the eduroam wifi service you are connecting to ('operator-name'). We will also collect the 'outer' identity username in the authentication request. The outer identity username is used to route the request to your home organisation and if you have not set this to be anonymous it will contain your user identity. You should configure your device to use an anonymous identity and in this case the information we collect only identifies your home organisation. The items of personal data we collect are not sufficient in themselves to enable eduroam(UK) to identify you as an individual, but may be passed to legitimate authorities.
We collect this information in order to enable a secure and trusted eduroam service to be provided, to produce anonymised usage statistics, to facilitate troubleshooting and to provide compliance with the Janet security policy and acceptable use policy and to maintain the private network status of Janet. The collection of this information is also mandated by the European eduroam confederation of which eduroam(UK) is a member and which facilitates international roaming.

Access to it will be restricted will only be passed on to other eduroam member organisations, GÉANT the European eduroam operator or to UK national authorities, in order to co-operate in investigations of breach of security or AUPs or the law; except that the device identifier may be passed on to GÉANT to produce anonymised usage statistics.
