Cookies, similar technologies, and online advertising
We and our service providers may collect information through the use of “cookies” and similar technologies, such as tracking pixels, to distinguish you from other users of our website, to help us improve your experience of our website and our services, to understand how you navigate through and interact with our services, to learn what content is popular, to enhance the services and provide you with a more relevant and personalised experience, for authentication and advertising purposes, to save your preferences, for fraud detection and security, and to collect certain usage and device information as described above. For detailed information regarding the Cookies we use and the purposes we use them for, please refer to our
Cookie Policy
. We may also collect this kind of information when you interact with email messages or other communications we send you. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognise your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use our services. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email; they are designed to collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates, measure the popularity of our services and associated advertising, and access cookies. We and our vendors (including Google Analytics) also use these technologies and the information collected by them for data analytics purposes. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of our services.
We may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers, and others) on our services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you as you browse the internet. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect about you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
We sometimes also associate cookies with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) and disclose such information with to advertising partners and vendors in hashed, non-human-readable form to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.
The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our website by non-affiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link
or the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link
to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customise Google display network ads, visit the
Google Ads Settings page

If you are a U.S. resident, please see the “Additional privacy information for California and other United States residents” supplement for additional ways to opt out of targeted advertising under U.S. law.

How do we help to keep your data safe and secure?
The security of your personal data is important to us. We have put in place appropriate security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, or modification of your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet and no means of electronic or physical storage is absolutely secure. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it (e.g., encryption of more sensitive data elements such as payment information). When you give your personal data to Jellyfish we will process that data in accordance with our responsibilities.
To prevent unauthorised access, to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the correct usage of information, we monitor and adjust our physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your personal data while in our care, or in the care of any outside suppliers with whom we may contract to process your data on our behalf. Any outside suppliers are under strict contractual terms to mirror the security policies that we currently have in place.
Data retention
We will keep personal data only for as long as we need it to maintain our relationship with our contacts, provide them with the products, services or information they have requested, to inform our research into the preferences of our customers /clients, to comply with the law, to ensure we do not communicate with individuals that have asked us not to, and for other necessary purposes, like resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and for fraud prevention and related security purposes.. When we no longer need the information, we will dispose of it securely, using specialist companies to do this work for us if necessary.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.
Disclosing information to others
Primarily we use your information within Jellyfish in order to provide you with the service or product you have selected.
We will only disclose your information to specific third parties in the following circumstances:
To facilitate the service of a physical product, for example providing appropriate details (such as name, address, payment details as applicable) to the Product Owner of a print magazine subscription or subscription box.
We may use partners to help manage, monitor and optimise our Services to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, communications and how visitors use the Services.
If you have provided consent to receive marketing correspondence from the Product Owner of a product you have purchased through one of our Services, your data will be disclosed to them and/or the data processor authorised to operate on their behalf for the specific purposes to which you consented. In each of the above cases, the Product Owner will have their own privacy policy which will cover their use of your personal data.
Where we need to do so in order to provide a service you have requested. For example online transactions with us are secured using the SSL encryption method and hosted with our third party payment providers including Stripe, MPP Global Solutions Ltd, SagePay Europe Ltd and PayPal. This is to provide enhanced security and protection to our customers. All our payments processed via PayPal are processed via PayPal References Transactions.
We may use certain third party services to verify your identity in certain circumstances, such as that your postcode is valid for delivery, age for age restricted products and company checks.
It may be necessary to disclose information to certain third party industry bodies, such as the ABC or BPA, for audit and accreditation purposes, to confirm that sales have taken place.
To improve the service and advertising that you receive (on our Services and third party websites and apps). These activities may involve the use of cookies or similar technologies. For more information please review the “Cookies, similar technologies, and online advertising” section below and read our
Cookie Policy
.
If disclosure is required or permitted by law. We will always ensure that those requesting the information have the legal right to do so.
If another company should purchase any of our companies or assets, including our database, that company will have the right of possession of the personal data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations formerly attributable to us.
Data Transfers
We may transfer your personal data to a Product Owner based outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA), in a country with less stringent data protection laws. Where we do so we take the necessary steps to comply with applicable legal requirements and ensure any necessary appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place, so that your personal data is treated securely and your rights are respected. For further information about the documents we use to protect your information when it is transferred outside your country or region, please submit a request to
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com

If the information we hold for you is incorrect or needs amending, please let us know and we will update our records. Where available, you may view and amend these yourself in the My Account area of the relevant Service’s website.
Delete Data/Right to erasure and Account Closure
- you can ask us to erase or delete all of your personal data and record with us. If at any time you would like to close and delete an account please contact privacy@jellyfishconnect.com. Your personal data will be removed from our active user database and will be deleted assuming that you are current with all payment obligations, that Jellyfish does not believe it reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action, and that we are under no other legal obligation to retain such information. Please be aware that any unfulfilled subscriptions may be cancelled without refund, you will have to re-register in order to use the respective Service again, and any existing purchases will be forfeited. It is your responsibility to request a refund from Jellyfish or the appropriate merchant or Product Owner.
Restrict processing:
You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy,
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it,
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims,
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Data portability:
You have the right to have provided to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent:
Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Non-discrimination:
We are committed to ensuring that you will not be denied services, charged a different price, or provided a different level or quality of services just because you exercised your rights under applicable law. Please note, however, that we may need some personal data in order to provide you our services, which means that we may not be able to provide some of our services if you refuse to provide your personal data.
We may need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address.
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be permitted to designate an authorised agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorised agent to be verified, you must provide the authorised agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorised agent’s request.
Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. If we deny your request, we will provide you with information on how to appeal the decision, if applicable, in our communications with you.
If you would like further information regarding your legal rights or would like to exercise any of them, please email us at

California and US Privacy Info
Additional privacy information for California and other United States residents
This section supplements our
Privacy Policy
with additional information for California and other United States residents about our information collection and use practices as required by U.S. laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”). In this section, the terms “personal information,” which also includes “personal data,” and “sensitive personal information” have the meaning set forth in such laws.
The following chart provides information about our practices in the 12 months leading up to the effective date of our Privacy Policy in relation to the categories of personal information that we collected generally – including the categories of sensitive personal information (precise location information and health information) – the purposes for which we use the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose the information for legitimate business purposes.
Categories of information collected (see “Types of personal information collected and what we use the information for” in the Privacy Policy for more detail)
Purpose of use
Categories of third parties to whom we disclose the information for business and operational purposes (See “How we disclose information we collect” in the Privacy Policy for more details)

Disclosure will depend on the nature of the information provided.
“Sale” and “Sharing” of Personal Information.
United States data law defines the “sale” of data as “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration”.  “Sharing” is defined as “sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer‘s personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.”
As explained in the “How We Disclose Information We Collect” section of our Privacy Policy, we provide personal information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our services, and use related analytics partners to assist us in analysing the effectiveness of our online advertisements. The disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, or, the “sharing” of your personal information for purposes of “cross-context behavioural advertising.”
The following chart lists the categories of personal information we have “sold” or “shared” over the last 12 months and the categories of third parties to which we have “sold” or “shared:”

As a United States resident, depending on the state in which you reside, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/use of your information for targeted advertising.”
If you would like to opt out of our online disclosure such as through cookie and pixel technology of your personal data for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” for purposes of targeted advertising, please click the "My Privacy Choices" link in our website footer and follow the instructions. You can also submit a request to opt out of our offline disclosures of information that are subject to applicable opt out rights by emailing us at
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
. Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may be permitted to designate an authorised agent to submit such requests on your behalf. If you have a legally-recognised browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognise such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal data of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorisation.
“Shine the Light” Disclosure.
You can exercise your rights under the California “Shine the Light” law – which gives you the right to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes – by emailing us at
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
.
Retention.
We will retain your data as described above in the “Data retention” section of our Privacy Policy.
Notice of Financial Incentives.
We may offer opportunities to receive certain benefits, such as discounts, promotion entries, or other similar incentives, which may require the provision of personal data, such as answering surveys or providing additional feedback or information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”). Your participation in Incentive Programs is purely voluntary. When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program. The monetary value of the reward, discount, or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of participation in the Incentive Program.
Notice Concerning Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognise or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about
Do Not Track
. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced above, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the "sharing” of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.
