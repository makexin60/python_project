By using Blind, you agree to the policies and procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy. You should review this Privacy Policy to understand our practices pertaining to personal information.
By using our Services, you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post text, graphics, photos or other materials (collectively referred to as "Content"), to Blind and to share Content publicly. Please be advised that other users may search for, see, use, or share any of your Content that you make publicly available through Blind, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
1. Information We Collect
1.1. Information You Provide to Us Directly. This includes your changeable username, password and entity-related email address in connection with our registration process and the maintenance of your account with us, which allows you to use our Services. Your entity-related email address is immediately one-way encrypted, making it immediately indecipherable and unable to be used for identifying individuals when you register for the Services. We do NOT collect nor retain your name, address, phone number or any additional identifying information in order to use our Services.

1.4. Cookies and Similar Technologies. Like many websites, we may use cookies, pixels, and similar technology. These may include identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may identify your device or browser, which solely serve to prevent unauthorized activities, such as account creation or use by users restricted due to Terms of Use violations.
1.5. Information from Third Parties. We may be provided with email addresses or encrypted values from third parties for purposes of verifying the profession of users who cannot sign up using a corporate email address and reverifying the employment status of users. Our users may request that we invite other individuals to use our Services on their behalf. In such circumstances, the entity-related email address provided by the original user is also one-way encrypted to conceal the identity of the potential new user.
1.6. Commercial Information. If you engage in a monetary transaction with us to purchase B Money in connection with our Services, you may be required to provide billing information, including your name, address, phone number, and credit card data. Please be advised that, while we will be able to assign specific quantities of B Money to your account, Teamblind utilizes third-party payment services to effectuate these transactions and will not have access to any of this billing information.
2. Storage and Processing of Information
Your entity-related email address is immediately one-way encrypted, making it indecipherable and unable to be used for identifying individuals when you register for the Services. We store and/or process this encrypted information in the United States, South Korea, and Japan. We are able to determine the quantity of employees associated with a company who have registered to use our Services.
We use commercially reasonable safeguards and take reasonable steps to keep the information encrypted at all times so that the information will not be decrypted and accessible. Please be advised that our retention of all data and information obtained in connection with our Services is consistent with industry-accepted practices and industry security standards. We implement these security practices for the safekeeping of your data. We do not retain any personally identifiable information of our users.
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account information and for controlling access to our Services at all times, as we are not able to decrypt and access your encrypted account information.
