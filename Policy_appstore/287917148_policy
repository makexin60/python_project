PRIVACY:
At iGRASS PTY LTD, we are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information.
This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and manage your personal data when you visit our website or use our iOS app (collectively referred to as “Services”).
Information Collection | Specific Apps
1.1 App Specific Privacy Policy | “Face The Music”
Our iOS App Store app, entitled ‘Face The Music,’ utilises facial data (simplistic facial expressions, such as smiling, mouth open, closed etc) solely for deciding which musical note and/or sound effect to trigger for music loop creation within the app. We do not save, or transmit any facial data to any third parties.
In compliance with the App Store guidelines, we are committed to providing clear and comprehensive information to users regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of user or device data. Our application utilises Apple’s TrueDepth API to generate music based on facial data (simplistic facial expressions); however, it’s crucial to note that we neither store nor transmit any facial data to third parties. The collected data is exclusively used within the confines of the application to allow it to function as intended. We take extensive measures to safeguard this data against unauthorised access or disclosure. Should a user decide to withdraw or revoke consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of their device or user data, we promptly cease all related activities (i.e. The user can initiate app deletion or discontinue use at any time). Our policy outlines our commitment to transparency and the protection of user privacy.
In addition, Microphone/Video access is possible within the app (with user consent) to capture video samples with microphone audio (via the front facing camera), that are recorded, saved and played back to the user during music loop creations. We temporarily save these video samples securely within the app for playback purposes only. We never transmit any of these video files to third parties. All temporarily recorded video files are deleted at the next run of the app.
In summary, this app does not collect or transmit any user data (including facial information) or data of any other kind.
