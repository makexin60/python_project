As part of the registration process, you will select a user name based on your e-mail (“User Name”), and a password (“Password”) to access the User Name. Your User Name and Password are your credentials (“Credentials”) to access the restricted portions of this Site. You agree not to create a User Name that is vulgar, attempts to impersonate another person, or otherwise violates the rights of third parties, and acknowledge that Zoomshift may reject any User Name that it determines is unacceptable in its sole discretion.
You are solely responsible for access and use of the Site and Services under your User Name and Password and for maintaining the confidentiality of your User Name and Password. You also agree to promptly notify Zoomshift of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Site or Services and ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.

Please note that Zoomshift will store a Password retrieval question and answer, which allows you the ability to retrieve your Password.

If you elect to use Paid Services, you agree to the pricing and payment terms listed on the Site, as updated from time to time. Zoomshift may add new services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion. If Zoomshift makes change to its pricing or payment terms, they shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in these Terms. Zoomshift may lock your account for non-payment at any time. In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts or chargebacks will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to the collection of delinquent accounts or chargebacks including, but not limited to, collection fees, convenience fees or other third parties’ charges. You agree that all communication related to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by phone.

You may cancel Paid Services at any time by sending an email to Zoomshift at
support@zoomshift.com
. If you cancel Paid Services during the middle of a month, Zoomshift will not provide you with a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees as all fees paid for the Services are nonrefundable.
Payment Information; Taxes. All information that you provide in connection with Paid Services must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Services at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.
Termination. We reserve the right to permanently delete any customer data once you cease to be a paying customer. Currently, we delete data after 30 days following termination but we reserve the right to make changes to this policy, with or without notice, at any time. Upon cancellation of your account, you will also lose access to any grandfathered pricing plan.
Hibernation. At any time, you can pause your payment plan by putting your account into hibernation status for a stated amount of time. Your account will be automatically reactivated upon expiration of the hibernation period you specified and billing will resume. Hibernation terminates any access to grandfathered pricing plans, and following automatic reactivation Zoomshift will reactivate your account to either the same plan you had prior to hibernation or the closest available payment plan by dollars spent to your grandfathered payment plan even if this results in a higher priced plan, if applicable.
Free Trial. Zoomshift may, at its sole discretion, offer free trials of products or services. Zoomshift makes no warranties about the delivery time of such a free trial, and all free trials are subject to discontinuation by Zoomshift at any time for any reason, with or without notice. Upon the cancellation of a free trial subscription of the Services, any discount obtained via a coupon code will be null and void and any future subscription for the Services will be charged pursuant to Zoomshift’s normal pricing structure at that time.
