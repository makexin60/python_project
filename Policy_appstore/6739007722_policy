The Short Version
We collect absolutely nothing. Zero. Nada. Your debugging sessions stay on your device. Your duck is very discreet.
The Longer Version (Because Lawyers)
What We Collect
Nothing
What We Store
Nothing (except what's stored locally on your device)
What We Share
Nothing (your duck is excellent at keeping secrets)
Data Storage
All your debugging sessions, code snippets, and revelations are stored locally on your device. We don't have servers - we don't need them. Your duck operates in complete isolation.
Analytics
We don't track:
How often you debug
What languages you use
How many "aha!" moments you have
The number of times you've said "Oh, wait, I see it now..."
Your most embarrassing bugs
Your brilliant solutions
Your Rights
You have the right to:
Debug in peace
Talk to your duck without being recorded
Keep your "it was just a semicolon" moments to yourself
Delete the app and pretend this never happened
Legal Compliance
We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and any other privacy regulation by simply not collecting any data to regulate.
