Mobile Plan Data Top Ups
You can purchase a 1GB Data Top Up for $10 or a 3GB Data Top Up for $15.
You can purchase a Data Top Up at any time as long as the maximum additional data at any one time does not exceed 40GB above your included data allowance. Any Data Top Up you purchase will expire at the same time as your Mobile Plan, regardless of when you purchased it so please refer to the information displayed when you select the Data Top Up for purchase as this will tell you how long you have left to use your Data Top Up. Unused Data Top Up may qualify for rollover.
Data is
charged per 1KB
which means the minimum amount of data you'll consume in each data session is 1KB.
Once you have used up your Data Top Up, you can choose to purchase another Data Top Up or you can continue to use data on your phone provided you have Pay As You Go credit on your service. Data will then be charged at 5c per MB.
Super Pack Data Top Ups
The Super Pack Data Top Ups give you extra data to use should you need it. You can choose from 3 Data Top Ups:
3GB for $15
20GB for $30
70GB for $60
You can purchase a Super Pack Data Top Up at any time you like as long as your total data balance at any time does not exceed 200GB above your pack's included data allowance. Any Data Top Up you purchase will expire at the same time as your Super Pack, regardless of when you purchase it so please refer to the information displayed when you select the Top Up for purchase as this will tell you how long you have left to use your Data Top Up.
Data is
charged per 1KB
which means the minimum amount of data you'll consume in each data session is 1KB.
Once you have used up your Data Top Up, you can choose to purchase another Data Top Up or you can continue to use data on your phone provided you have Pay As You Go credit on your service. Data will then be charged at 6c per MB.
I've used all my Family Plan data, can I add more?
If you have a Family Plan and you need some extra data, you can purchase a Data Top Up at any time. It means that you can buy extra data at great rates if you need it, without paying upfront for something you don’t need.
You can add 3GB of data for $15 up to a maximum of 40GB above your included data allowance at any one time. Remember that any Data Top Up you purchase will expire at the same time as your Family Plan but may be eligible for rollover if the rollover criteria is met.
Remember, that the data you add to your Family Plan by purchasing a Data Top Up will be shared across all of the services on the Family Plan (subject to any limits the Owner may have set).

What is Auto Recharge?
Auto Recharge automatically recharges the same Mobile Plan, Family Plan, Data Plan or Super Pack when it expires. We'll send you an SMS and email to let you know we've renewed your plan.
Payment methods
You must have a valid Visa Card, Mastercard or PayPal payment method stored on your account.
You can add or update payment methods within your
MyALDImobile
online account
or via
the App
. You can also enable or disable the Auto Recharge function there.
Timing
Auto Recharges commence just after midnight on the day your recharge expires. Recharges are processed in batches and it generally takes 3-4 hours for the entire batch to complete.
It's important to have PAYG credit or you may find yourself without outgoing services while the batch process runs. If you use your PAYG credit during this time all charges are valid, and we will not refund the credit you have used.
If you are not comfortable using
PAYG credit while the batch process runs it is recommended that you
recharge manually instead.
What removes Auto Recharge?
There are few transactions that will automatically remove Auto Recharge and require you to re-enable it.
Manual recharges
If you perform a manual recharge whilst Auto Recharge is active, your Auto Recharge status will be removed.
You will need to turn your Auto Recharge back on if you wish to continue using Auto Recharge
Changing plans
If you have Auto Recharge setup on one of your numbers, and you change that number to a different plan, your Auto Recharge status will be removed.
You will need to turn your Auto Recharge back on if you wish to continue using Auto Recharge
Failures
There are several reasons why an Auto Recharge may fail:
Expired credit card – ensure that your credit card details are current
Credit card not on file – ensure that you register your credit card for payment
Change of bank account – you may have changed banks or opened a new account
Insufficient funds – there are not enough funds in your bank account to cover the recharge amount
In these events you shall be notified by SMS on the number registered to your service.
Auto Recharge app modal 2
Auto Recharge automatically recharges the same Mobile, Family, Data or Super Pack plan when it expires against a valid, stored payment method. The batching process takes up to 4 hours and during this time you may be without outgoing services if you don't have a PAYG credit balance. We'll send you a notification once complete or if there is a failure. Changing or manually recharging plans resets the Auto Recharge setting.
