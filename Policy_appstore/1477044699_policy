Privacy Statement
Safety is our specialty, and this also applies to handling your personal data and ensuring that your privacy is respected.
In this Privacy Policy, we describe which categories of personal data HomeSecure is processing, which purposes such data is collected for and how you may exercise your rights pursuant to applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the
GDPR
). Click on the text below to read more about our processing of personal data.
Which categories of personal data do we process?
We do in some cases also collect additional information from third parties in order to ensure that we have the correct and necessary information available. The personal data we process can be categorized as follows:
Identity information
, including name, address, phone number, e-mail address, customer number, national identity number and address of the location of the alarm system if this is not installed on your home address. If the customer is a corporate entity, we process the corporate identity information as well as contact information (name, phone number and e-mail address) to any designated contact person(s).
Financial information
, including payment details (including direct debit agreements if applicable) and credit rating. The latter is received from authorized credit rating agencies, and you will always receive a notification from the credit rating agency with a copy of the information they have shared with us.
Contractual data
, including a copy of the contract you have with HomeSecure, as well as any other documents signed as part of the onboarding or in connection with later contractual changes (for example if you move to a new address). The contract includes the address of the alarm installation, customer number, panel type as well as the price and billing information.
Call recordings,
including recordings of all calls to and from our alarm central. Unless you have opted-out from such recording, we also record calls to our customer support center.
Customer activities data

This also includes house type, panel type and location of alarm components as well as your password and code. Alarm installation details and activity log for all activity on the alarm system including detail on arming/disarming, alarm activations and technical alarms for all users of the alarm system. Management of integrated lock, door locks and smart plug controls (if you have these installed).

, such as your activity in the HomeSecure app and device ID, app ID, app version, browser/browser type and version, operating system and phone/device model and information about which network you use. Use of our digital services, including HomeSecure on our website and app, is governed by a
separate user agreement

E-mail data
, such as aggregated information about how our customers read our communication to them, i.e. whether the e-mail is read or not, whether any links are clicked one and time spent before the e-mail is opened.
Lead data
, such as if you fill out our contact form on our website or on a third party website, we process this data in order to contact you for marketing purposes
, at all times in compliance with applicable direct marketing/electronic privacy rules.
[DQ1]
We may also receive potential leads from our strategic partners based on your contract or interactions with them, for example through trade unions or associations, insurance companies or banks that we cooperate with.
Sales information
: We process personal data regarding our marketing activities, both online, by phone or in person. This includes number of contacts, information about the salesperson and installation personnel, dates of contact(s), summary of dialogue and channel/source of the marketing activity.
Hardware maintenance data
, such as if you request maintenance or report a defect in your alarm system hardware we will log this information and share if with our installation team who will log the account number, customer name, address, alarm system history and details of the maintenance activities performed or to be performed. We may also share specific information with our hardware supplier if this is deemed necessary to fix the defect.
Cookie data:
We use cookies, pixels, scripts and similar technologies on our website and in the app in order to use in order to recognize you across websites, browsers and devices and to adapt to your preferences when using our digital platforms. This is information about your device, IP-address, app ID, app version, browser/browser type and version, operating system and phone/device model and information about which network you use. Please refer to our
Cookie Policy
for more information. Unless otherwise specified above, all of these data points are generated from you or your use of our services. Please note that if you do not provide us with the personal data set out above, there may be services we will be unable to provide to you.
Location data:
If you have enabled the Panic functionality in the HomeSecure app on your mobile device, we will process the location data of your device in the event of a triggered SOS alert, provided that you explicitly consent to such location sharing when triggering the specific alert.
How do we use your personal data?
Below you will find an overview of the purposes for which we process personal data, which categories of data we use for these purposes, and the legal basis of our processing.
Onboarding of new customers
If you contact us via our contact form on our website, we process your
Lead data
to provide you with relevant offers and services. This based on your consent when submitting the contact form pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(a). If we receive your
Lead data
from our strategic partners, we process this data either based on the consent you have provided to our partner (GDPR article 6(1)(a)) or based on our legitimate interest in promoting and selling our products and services pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f).
(noting, however, that all processing constituting direct marketing will only ever take place on the basis of your express consent).
[DQ2]
You may in any event always opt-out from receiving marketing from us by contacting our
Customer Support center
. When you receive marketing e-mails from us, there will always be an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the e-mail which allows you to opt-out from further marketing e-mails. There will also always be an optout shortcode at the end of our SMS’ to optout of future marketing text messages.
If you wish to become a HomeSecure customer, we process your
Identity Information, Financial information, Contractual data, Sales information
and
User and alarm system data
in order to provide you with an offer for the rental or purchase of the alarm equipment, to enable installation of the alarm system and to register the signed contract. We check your credit rating in order to assess whether you are capable of managing the payment of the monthly subscription fee, which requires us to process your national identity number pursuant to the Data Protection Act  §12.  All of the above processing of personal data is performed in order to enter into a contract with you pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(b).
Administration and maintenance of customer relationship
Once you have become a customer of HomeSecure, we process your
Financial information
and
Identity information
in order to issue monthly invoices and register payments in our accounting systems. This processing for invoicing purposes is performed to fulfill our contract with you pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(b), while our processing for accounting purposes is performed in order to comply with our legal obligations in terms of book keeping and tax reporting pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(c).
If you contact our Customer Support center, we may store
Call recordings
unless you have opted-out from such recording. These recordings are used for quality assurance and training purposes based on our legitimate interest in ensuring that our customer support personnel provide the best possible services to our customers pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f). We also make a note in our customer database of the nature and subject of your call to us, for the purpose of our ability to respond better to any later inquiries you may have and to log any complaints or defects that may arise. Our legal basis for processing personal data for this purpose is our legitimate interest in providing you with the best possible customer experience and ensuring continuity in the assistance and support you receive from us pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f).
If an alarm is triggered, we process
Identity data, Images
and
User and alarm system data
in order to follow-up on and if necessary, to act on emergency situations (such as fires or break-ins). We may also process third-party data for this purpose. i.e., personal data about the persons registered as users of the alarm system by the account owner, as well as emergency contact data. This is done for the purpose of providing you with the services you have purchased from us pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(b). In such cases, we will also store the
Call recordings
from the alarm central on the basis of our legal obligation as alarm provider pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(c). If an SOS alert is triggered in the app, we use Location data in order to assess whether you should be contacted by phone or through the voice box in the alarm panel, and it will be used to locate your device if you request assistance outside of the property where the alarm is installed. Access to your location is necessary for the use of the SOS function. We will not see your location unless you specifically send us a SOS alert, and the tracking will end when the SOS alert is closed. The processing of Location data is based on your explicit consent to allow location tracking in the app when you use the app for the first time, ref. GDPR art. 6(1)(a). You may at any time withdraw your consent in the settings menu on your device.
Should you experience defects in your alarm system or digital services, we process your
Hardware maintenance data
,
User and alarm system data
and
Identity data
in order to log the defect, perform maintenance and service on the alarm system and follow-up with you to ensure that you are satisfied with the services provided. If necessary to fulfill this purpose, we may also have to process
Contractual data, Financial information
and
Customer activities data
if this is needed in order to perform the necessary maintenance and follow-up of the issue. Our legal basis for processing personal data for this purpose is to fulfill our contractual obligations pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(b).
Furthermore, we process data regarding the customer relationship and customer activities for statistical and analytical purposes in addition to improvement of our services, optimization of customer satisfaction and customization of our terms. Our legal basis for the processing of personal data for these purposes is our legitimate interest related to innovation and customer satisfaction, ref. GDPR art. 6(1)(f).
Marketing and personalization on digital platforms
We process
Lead data, E-mail data, Sales information, Cookie data
and
Identity information
in order to perform marketing activities to potential customers. This is based on your consent, either through cookie consent settings or through other consents we have requested from you for example as part of the onboarding or in the app, ref. GDPR article 6(1)(a). Note that you may be asked to consent to receipt of marketing communications from HomeSecure and/or from another member of the Sector Alarm Group. You may at all times withdraw your marketing consents.
Direct marketing
: Customers of HomeSecure (or any specific member of the wider Sector Alarm Group) will receive newsletters and other direct marketing information by e-mail, in MyPages or by SMS unless the customer has opted-out from receiving such marketing material either by unsubscribing to our newsletter or by contacting our customer service center. We process
E-mail data
,
Sales information
and
Identity information
for this purpose, and the legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest in promoting our products and services pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f) and applicable marketing legislation. Former customers may for a period of up to 12 months after termination of the contract received marketing campaigns from the company unless one has opted-out from such marketing.
Digital marketing:
HomeSecure executes digital marketing activities both on our own websites and platforms, as well as on third party platforms. For the latter, we cooperate with marketing partners such as Meta/Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Google.
We process Cookie data, Logs from use of our platforms
and
Identity information for this purpose
. We also measure the effect of our marketing activities on digital platforms and track conversions in order to optimize our marketing strategies. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in promoting our products and services, as the privacy implication for you as a user is limited in such cases. We minimize the data categories processed for this purpose and you may also disable personalized advertisements through the settings of the various platforms. Note other members of the Sector Alarm group may share the categories of personal data identified above with HomeSecure in order to optimize our marketing strategies. HomeSecure may also share this personal data with other Sector Alarm group members for similar reasons, Any such data sharing shall be undertaken in full compliance with data protection law.
[DQ3]
Segmentation:
As part of our marketing efforts, we use segmentation as a means of selecting the target group for marketing campaigns. For example, if we are going to send out a campaign for new electronic door locks, we segment out those of our customers who already have such door locks installed. We may also use geography, house type and other relevant and non-discriminatory factors as a basis for our segmentation. Furthermore, we perform automated analysis of our customer databases in order to identify the appropriate marketing activities towards the various customer groups. In digital marketing activities, we also use segmentation to avoid showing marketing content to those that are already customers of PhoneWatch. For this segmentation we use the services Facebook Conversion API and Google Enhanced Conversions, where Facebook and Google as our data processors process hashed e-mail addresses, phone numbers, names and IP addresses in order to exclude the customers from digital marketing activities.
As set out above, our marketing activities are normally performed based on our legitimate interest in promoting our products and services pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f) and applicable marketing legislation. If consent is required to perform marketing activities pursuant to marketing law, we will only perform such marketing activities based on your consent pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(a). For the sake of good order, it should be noted that even though you withdraw your consent or opt-out of marketing activities, you may still see PhoneWatch ads in the digital space – but it will in such cases not be adapted to you or targeted to you.
In all cases, our marketing activities will comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011. Those regulations set out rules relating to how direct marketing communications may be sent to consumers by businesses.
As required by applicable consumer- and marketing law, we also register information about opt-outs from marketing through door-knocking, telephone or e-mail. The legal basis for this processing is to comply with a legal obligation as per GDPR article 6(1)(c).
[DQ4]
Quality assurance and training
On an aggregated level, we collect and report our response time on phone and in person to activated alarms, customer satisfaction, sales statistics and other key performance indicators using
Call recordings
and
User and alarm system data
to identify where we may need to execute improvement measures and for training and quality purposes. Our legal basis for performing such aggregation is our legitimate interest of self-improvement and providing quality when performing our services pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f). Please note that once the data has been aggregated, it cannot be linked to you as an individual and does thus not constitute personal data anymore.
We may also perform quality tests on
Call recordings
and
Customer activities data
and
User and alarm system data
in order to use this for following-up with our employees to ensure that they provide high-quality customer support, and also to train new employees. This is based on our legitimate interest in ensuring quality of service pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f).
Furthermore, we process identity information and contractual data in order to conduct surveys to measure customer satisfaction, either directly or through the use of external partners. We process the results of such surveys on an aggregated level. This is based on our legitimate interest in improving quality of service pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f).
Partner and supplier management
As part of our supplier and partner management, we process
Identity information
for the contact person(s) of our partner and suppliers, as well as contact information to those of their employees that we interact with in order to execute the services and contracts in question. This processing is based on our legitimate interest in having physical persons to contact when interacting with legal entities and to maintain such contractual relationships pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f).
IT administration and testing
In order to ensure the availability, integrity and confidentiality of all personal data, our IT department performs logging, performance testing, analysis, penetration testing, system monitoring, access management, failure detection and incident management operations on a continuous basis. Certain privileged users within IT therefore have access to all categories of personal data processed by HomeSecure. We have strict internal access management procedures in order to ensure that all employees have access only to the data they need to perform their tasks and duties as employees.
We have back-ups of all our IT-applications for the purpose of ensuring availability of personal data. The back-ups are not in active use and deleted on a continuous basis when overwritten by new back-up material.
Before we go live with a material update to any of our key IT applications, we perform systematic testing to ensure that the functionality is working as it should. As a starting point we only use synthetic or pseudonymized data for such purposes, however there may be instances during the last phase of testing where it is necessary to test on personal data. In such cases, we document why this is necessary and we limit the testing audience to what is strictly necessary only and the test data is subject to strict access and retention restrictions.
All of the above actions performed by IT are necessary for HomeSecure to protect your personal data and our internal data, and is thus based on our legitimate interest in ensuring that we have an adequate level of security in our IT applications pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f).
Execution of deletion, rectification, pseudonymization and anonymization is also performed by our IT department in order to comply with the legal obligations of GDPR article 13 – 21 and article 32, pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(c).
Special categories of personal data
We do not actively collect, request or otherwise process special categories of personal data (also called sensitive data) regarding our customers or partners. However, if it is deemed necessary to process such data we will ensure that we have a legal basis for such processing in both GDPR article 6(1) and 9(2). In the case of activated alarms involving criminal offences (or suspicions thereof), the
Images
and the
User and alarm system data
may entail processing of such personal data covered by GDPR article 10 and Part 5 of the Data Protection Act 2018 if such personal data is processed for subsequent police investigations. Normally, we only share personal data with An Garda Siochana on your request When you contact our Customer Service center by phone, chat or e-mail, please do not state any sensitive information, such as health information, in such communication. We will never ask you for your national identity number, password, code or payment details in any e-mail – please refer to the
Security
section below. In some instances, we collaborate with trade unions or other organizations to provide discounted alarm services and products to the members of such organization. In such cases, we process personal data regarding your membership in order to ensure that you qualify for the discounts available to the organization’s members only. Our legal basis for such processing is your consent as per GDPR art. 9(2)(a) which you give us when you register to receive the benefits available to such members.
Other purposes
Other than as set out above, we may process personal data if necessary to determine, pursue, defend or enforce legal claims – for example in a dispute resolution setting pursuant to GDPR article 6(1)(f) and article 9(2)(f), as well as other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes listed above pursuant to GDPR article 6(4), such as for bookkeeping purposes or for the purpose of sale of business.
Who do we share your personal data with?
We may share your personal data with third parties only when it is necessary as part of our contract with you, (for example when we contact emergency contacts in the case of an active alarm event), for the conduct of business or when there is a legal or statutory obligation to do so. Whenever we disclose your personal data to third parties, we will only disclose that amount of your personal data necessary to meet such business need or legal requirement. Otherwise, your personal data will not be disclosed to others unless you have given your consent to this, for example in connection with a benefit/special offer or bonus program from one of our strategic partnerships, or if we are legally obligated to make such disclosure.
Below is a list of the categories of recipients we share personal data with. When sharing personal data, we will always ensure that we have proper agreements and confidentiality undertakings in place. We do not sell your personal data to any third party for commercial purposes.
Group companies:
We are part of the European Sector Alarm Group, in which the Norwegian entity Sector Alarm Holding AS is the controlling entity. The group IT function administers some of our IT applications on our behalf as our data processor, and we have a data processing agreement in place for this purpose. This means that personnel from group IT has access to the personal data we have stored in our IT applications. Other group functions may also request access to personal data in order to perform analysis and to generate reports on sales statistics, customer satisfaction surveys and similar topics in order to ensure reporting to our group management and board of directors. All accesses to our IT applications are granted on a strict need-to-know basis and limited to what is strictly necessary only.
As noted above, we may share certain categories of personal data with other members of the Sector Alarm group in order to streamline and optimize our use of digital marketing channels and to facilitate appropriate direct marketing activities for potential customers (always strictly in compliance with applicable rules relating to direct marketing communications, including in relation to the requirement for consent to such direct marketing activities from a recipient).
[DQ5]
Suppliers
We use suppliers that provide services to us, where processing of personal data is necessary for the supplier to deliver such services. If the supplier processes personal data on our behalf, and we determine the means and purposes of the processing, they are a data processor. We will only use data processors who can guarantee compliance with applicable data protection laws and our technical and organizational requirements, and we will always have a data processing agreement in place to govern our instructions to such data processor. We have the following key categories of suppliers:
–        IT application providers: These suppliers may perform service and maintenance on the IT applications they provide to us. To the extent they have access to, or are otherwise processing, personal data on our behalf as data processor, we have a data processing agreement in place. They may also store data on their servers or in a cloud service provided by them, and if so they are our data processors
–        Partners: We collaborate with partners who generate potential customers to us, such as trade unions and associations, moving agencies, insurance companies and others. These parties are not our data processors, and they share your information with us on the basis of their agreements or consents with you
–        Invoicing and debt collections: We use external suppliers to execute our invoicing and debt collections services on our behalf. These suppliers are our data processors
–        Security guards: We collaborate with professional security guards who execute house visits in the case of alarms on our behalf, and in order for the security guards to perform their tasks we must share your name and address with them, as well as any information we have pertaining to that specific alarm in question
Marketing providers: We use Google Inc and Facebook Inc for marketing placement on the internet and in social media. For more information, see our
Cookie Policy
, We also use suppliers who are data processors to perform customer satisfaction surveys and market research on our behalf.
–        Credit rating agencies: We collaborate with authorized credit rating agencies in order to assess your ability to pay the monthly subscription fee.
Police and other public authorities
In the case of an alarm where there is a burglary or other potentially criminal activity, we will share surveillance material with the police if so requested. In some cases other public authorities may also request personal data in which case we may be legally required to disclose the personal data.
International Data Transfers
By default, we always strive to ensure that your personal data is processed within the European Economic Area (EEA). However, some of our suppliers are based outside the EEA or have servers or group companies located outside the EEA. In such cases, we will ensure to have a valid transfer mechanism in place, namely adequacy decisions made by the EU Commission, Binding Corporate Rules or the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. In addition, we will implement additional safeguards to ensure that your rights and freedoms as a European citizen are adequately protected also in the case of such transfers of data outside the EEA. You may find a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses HomeSecure use by clicking
here
and searching for 32010D0087. Under special circumstances and on an ad-hoc basis only, we may also transfer personal data to recipients outside the EEA if this is necessary to fulfil our contract with you or if you consent to such specific transfer. We may revise or update our transfer mechanisms to adhere to changes in data protection law or the requirements of the European Commission; if we do so, we shall update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
What are your rights and how do you exercise them?
As a data subject, you are afforded several rights and freedoms under applicable data protection laws and regulations. To exercise such rights, please contact our customer support center at 01 495 7070 or send an e-mail to our Data Protection Officer at dataquery@HomeSecure.ie. In order to ensure that we do not share personal data with unauthorized third parties, we will request that you confirm your identity before we respond to your request. Provided that we have confirmed your identity, we will respond as soon as possible and normally within 30 days. If we are not able to respond within 30 days, we will notify you of the delay and the reason for it in due course and prior to the 30-day deadline. Below is an overview of your rights.
