Filmo does not collect, store, or share any images, or data that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual. We do not have advertisers, nor do we require an account to use Filmo. All information that we do collect is usage and analytics data that is anonymized
, generic, and used to help us improve the quality of Filmo. We never upload your photos.
