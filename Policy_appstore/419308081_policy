Who we are and what we do
The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is a public body, created under the Education (Scotland) Act 1996.
SQA has two main roles, accreditation and awarding qualifications.
As an accreditation body, SQA:
accredits qualifications
approves, and quality assures awarding bodies that intend to enter people for these qualifications
As an awarding body, SQA:
creates and develops qualifications
validates qualifications (makes sure they are well written and meet the needs of learners and tutors)
reviews qualifications to ensure they are up to date
arranges for, assists in, and carries out, the assessment of people taking SQA qualifications
quality-assures schools, colleges and training centres that offer SQA qualifications
issues certificates to candidates
We also offer a range of services to businesses and training providers, and advise Scottish Government on matters related to our functions and tasks.
This privacy statement explains how SQA collects and uses information about you in order to provide our services.
The nature of our relationship with you will determine what personal information we collect about you and how we use it. Further detail for each relationship is set out below.
We also will process information about you if you are involved in the delivery of SQA qualifications (or qualifications we accredit), attended one of our events, if you are the parent or other relative of a candidate or a member of the public that has contacted SQA, a supplier or you have used our website.
