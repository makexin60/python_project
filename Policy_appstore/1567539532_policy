We use your personal information on one or more of the following legal basis:
with your express consent
legal obligation
for legitimate business purposes;
and/or to perform a contract or an agreement with you
This enables us to use your personal information:
to provide the service or product you’ve requested or purchased

to contact you, if any issues arise in our premises or with your booking
to market our services and products to you

for employee recruitment
to assess and analyse our market, customers, products and services
to pursue and collect outstanding monies owed to NCP
for the apprehension and prosecution of offenders
for the prevention or detection of crime; and
to comply with our legal obligations
We also use your information to analyse and profile your purchasing preferences (e.g. market, customer and product analysis) to enable us to provide you with a personalised customer service experience, make decisions about you using computerised or automated technology. For example, automatically selecting products and/or services which we think will interest you from the information we have.
We may supplement the information that you provide to us with information that we receive from third parties. In particular, we will carry out searches with credit reference agencies and any information provided to us may be passed to these credit reference agencies for the purposes of confirming credit worthiness.
It is our policy to use information that cannot directly identify an individual wherever possible.
Telephone calls
We may record telephone and intercom calls to verify content which may then be used together with other customer records we hold for regulatory compliance, quality control and staff training, preventing or detecting criminal activity and for complaint resolution.
Who we disclose personal information to
We may share information about you:
with other companies in the NCP group
with third party service providers/companies that provide services for us on our behalf including IT services and mailing services e.g. website host, auditors, event organisers an individual has registered for; and/or
with our business partners who may use your information to provide you with the services you request, analyse and asses their market, customers, products and services
There may also be instances when we disclose your information:
if we have a duty pursuant to the law to do so, or if the law allows us to do so
to verify or enforce compliance with the policies and terms governing our services

Transfer outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)
We rarely transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we only do this in order to carry out the activities listed in “the information we collect” and “how we use your information” sections. In some instances where we need to send personal data outside the EEA, we put in place regulatory approved international data transfer contract clauses
How we keep your information secure
We’ll treat your information in strict confidence and we’ll endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep your personal information secure once it’s been transferred to our systems.
Personal data submitted through our service(s) are stored securely and protected by multiple anti-malware firewalls. However, the internet is not a secure medium and we can’t guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.
We use Direct Payment Gateways to process your card payments. These Direct Payment Gateways adhere to the standards set by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
PCI-DSS requirements, help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our Service and its service providers. Your payment data is stored only if necessary to complete your purchase transaction.
How long we keep your information
If we are providing services to you, we will retain your personal information for the duration of the services, unless otherwise agreed.
We retain:
Phone calls/ intercom calls, which are recorded, for 12 months
CCTV recordings for up to 30 days
Parking Charge Notice (PCN) records for 3 years
Unless otherwise set out in this privacy policy, any other information we process about you will be retained by us until we no longer need it for the purposes for which it was collected, as set out in this privacy policy and/or the relevant fair processing notice. We will base that decision on a number of criteria, including whether we are required by law to keep the information for a certain period of time, whether you have withdrawn consent to the processing, whether a contract has been performed and the likelihood of us needing to retain the information in the event of a claim arising, whether the data is still up to date and whether there are exceptions set out in the applicable data protection legislation that allows us to retain the personal data for a longer period or indefinitely.
