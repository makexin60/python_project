Provide aggregated information on how visitors use our site, such as 'traffic statistics' and 'response rates,' to third parties

Viewing/editing personal information:
You may change the information you have provided by logging into your account and editing the information. If you are the patient, your personal information will be viewable by all persons you have invited and registered on your account (e.g., Friends and Family Members).

We will continue to treat your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
Protecting personal information:
We take security seriously and take a number of steps to protect your personal information. You also play a big part in protecting the privacy of your personal information. When you create an account, we ask you to select a password that is unique to you. To protect your personal information from unwanted disclosure, you should not give your password to anyone with whom you would not share your personal information. Our website may also log you out after a period of inactivity and require you to log in again. When you are ready to leave this website, always log off and close your browser to help protect the confidentiality of your information.
Use of personal information.
Given the scope and variety of Medtronic online services that allow the creation of online user accounts, Medtronic will use your personal information for purposes related to the nature of the account and to why the account was established. These uses could include but are not limited to: account creation, management, and security; password restoration and renewal; and account usage. Your use of any such accounts, and the ability of Medtronic to use your personal information, is additionally subject to the terms and conditions accessible through the account login page.
What happens if the privacy statement changes?
If we decide to make a significant change to our Privacy Statement, we will post a notice on the homepage of our website for a period of time after the change is made. Significant changes are also described below.

This Privacy Statement was last reviewed on July 1, 2023. Our last significant revision occurred on January 15, 2022.
What about privacy on other websites?
This website may contain links to other websites. Some of those websites may be operated by Medtronic, and some may be operated by third parties. We provide the links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of websites operated by others. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other website, even the other Medtronic websites. We are not responsible for the performance of websites operated by third parties or for your business dealings with them. Therefore, whenever you leave this website, we recommend that you review each website’s privacy practices and make your own conclusions regarding the adequacy of these practices.
Does medtronic ever communicate directly with visitors to this website?
We may contact you periodically by email, mail, telephone, or text if you agree to that contact to provide information regarding programs, products, services and content that may be of interest to you.

The email response or confirmation may include your personal information, including personal information about your health, your name, address, etc.
Are there special rules about children's privacy?
We care about protecting the online privacy of children. We will not intentionally collect any personal information (such as a child's name or email address) from children under the age of 13. If you think that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us.
What about website security?
Security is very important to us. We also understand that security is important to you. We have implemented security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While we have implemented security measures, please keep in mind that “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet or elsewhere and no transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. In particular, email sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.

Medtronic may share or transfer personal information as part of a transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, under which a third party acquires or full or partial ownership of a Medtronic affiliate, subsidiary, or business. In the ordinary course of business, we will share some personal information with companies, such as service providers, that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf. Some companies performing services on our behalf may collect personal information for us.

In certain instances, we collect Protected Heath Information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

We use the HIPAA Safe Harbor method or the HIPAA Expert Determination method described in 45 C.F.R. § 164.514 to de-identify protected health information regulated under HIPAA. Once we have de-identified information, it is no longer personal information and we may treat it like other non-personal information. We may sell or disclose deidentified patient information consistent with our responsibilities under HIPAA. Entities to whom we disclose de-identified information are prohibited from re-identifying or attempting to re-identify it.

How We Share Personal Information
Medtronic will not share consumers’ personal information with an unrelated third party without permission, except as described below. Medtronic may share personal information with any member of our corporate group, including parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and other companies in which we have an ownership or economic interest for purposes that are consistent with those identified in our Privacy Statement and this Notice. Medtronic may share or transfer personal information as part of a transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, under which a third party acquires or full or partial ownership of a Medtronic affiliate, subsidiary, or business. In the ordinary course of business, we will share some personal information with companies, such as service providers, that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf. Some companies performing services on our behalf may collect personal information for us. In all cases in which we share consumers’ personal information with a third party vendor, we require them to keep personal information confidential, and will only allow them to keep, disclose, or use consumers’ information to provide the services we asked them to provide. We may be required to release consumers’ personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law, or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting users who violate our rules or engage in behavior which is harmful to other users or illegal. In addition, we may keep, disclose, and use consumers’ personal information in order to comply with U.S. FDA and other governmental guidance, directions, regulations, and laws.
De-Identification of Protected Health Information
In certain instances, we collect Protected Heath Information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). We may de-identify such information, meaning that you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. We use the HIPAA Safe Harbor method or the HIPAA Expert Determination method described in 45 C.F.R. § 164.514 to de-identify protected health information regulated under HIPAA. Once we have de-identified information, it is no longer personal information and we may treat it like other non-personal information. We may sell or disclose deidentified patient information consistent with our responsibilities under HIPAA. Entities to whom we disclose de-identified information are prohibited from re-identifying or attempting to re-identify it. Anyone with whom we contract who receives any de-identified data derived from Protected Health Information is prohibited by law from attempting to re-identify that data.
Categories of Personal Information We Sell
We do not sell personal information of California consumers.
This does not include disclosures that are not a “sale” under the CCPA, including when
Consumers instruct us to disclose their personal information,
A consumer instructs us to interact with a third party that does not sell that information,
We use or share consumers’ personal information pursuant to a written contract with a service provider that is necessary to perform a business purpose, where our contract prevents the provider from using, keeping, or disclosing consumers’ personal information for any purpose other than the reason supplied in the contract, or
Consumers’ personal information is transferred as part of a transaction in which the third party assumes control of all or part of our business.
Personal Information on Minors
We do not sell personal information of California consumers, including minors.

Right to non-discrimination.
The CCPA grants California consumers the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights.

Submitting a Request or Inquiry
For U.S. data subject rights requests contact us via email at
rs.globaldataprivacyoffice@medtronic.com
or call us at our toll-free number 866-639-6907.
Your request will be confirmed within 10 days of receipt and we will respond within 45 days, unless shorter periods are required by law. If we need more than 45 days, we will notify you that your request is being delayed.
We can only respond to your request if it is verifiable. This means we are obligated to take reasonable steps to verify your identity or your authorized agent’s authority and your right to access the information you request. In the process of verifying your request, we may contact you to ask for additional information that will help us do so, including government-issued IDs containing your name and address, utility bills containing that same information, and/or unique identifiers like usernames. We will only use that additional information in the verification process, and not for any other purpose. Once we have received and verified the requested information from you, we will contact you with our response to your request, including any data, if applicable. If we do not hear from you or are unable to verify your identity for the request, we will contact you to inform you that we cannot process your request because we cannot verify your identity.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

This information is collected from your computer's web browser: If you only read or download information on our website, we do not collect or learn your name, email address, home address, or other personal information about you. We may place a text file called a cookie in the browser files of your computer when you visit. The cookie may be stored on your computer's hard drive. The information that we collect using cookies is non-personal information. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our website may not work properly for you if you do so. We will not allow third parties to place cookies on our website.

We are always looking for ways to better serve you and improve this website. We will use non-personal information from you to help us make this website more useful to visitors. We also will use non-personal information for other business purposes. For example, we may use non-personal information or aggregate de-identified personal information to:
Create reports for internal use to develop programs, products, services or content
Customize the information or services that are of interest to you
Share it with or sell it to third parties
Provide aggregated 'traffic statistics' and 'response rates' to third parties
What is personal information?

For analytical purposes and to research, develop and improve programs, products, services and content

In the ordinary course of business, we will share some personal information with companies that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf. For example, we may use different vendors or suppliers to ship you products that you order on our website. In these cases, we provide the vendor with information to process your order such as your name and mailing address.

Protect our rights or property
Protect someone's health, safety or welfare
Comply with a law or regulation, court order or other legal process

Recent revisions to the Privacy Statement:

What about privacy on other websites?
This website may contain links to other websites. Some of those websites may be operated by Medtronic, and some may be operated by third parties. We provide the links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of websites operated by others. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other website, even the other Medtronic websites. We are not responsible for the performance of websites operated by third parties or for your business dealings with them. Therefore, whenever you leave this website we recommend that you review each website's privacy practices and make your own conclusions regarding the adequacy of these practices.
Does Medtronic ever communicate directly with visitors to this website?
We may contact you periodically by email, mail or telephone to provide information regarding programs, products, services and content that may be of interest to you. In addition, some of the features on this website allow you to communicate with us using an online form. If your communication requests a response from us, we will send you a response via email. The email response or confirmation may include your personal information, including personal information about your health, your name, address, etc. We cannot guarantee that our emails to you will be secure from unauthorized interception.
Are there special rules about children's privacy?
We care about protecting the online privacy of children. We will not intentionally collect any personal information (such as a child's name or email address) from children under the age of 13. If you think that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us.
What about website security?
We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email
