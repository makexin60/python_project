9. How we protect your information
We take protecting your information seriously. We follow a comprehensive information-security program and use technical and organisational measures, such as two-step verification, encryption,
pseudonymisation
and ongoing security training for our employees, to protect your information. We also continually evaluate emerging threats, the latest security technologies and best practices.
When you contact us, we will ask you to provide certain information so we can confirm your identity and your right to access the account. This is to make sure your account and associated information are protected from unauthorised access.
We generally store your information for as long as is necessary for:
the purposes described in section 6 of this privacy policy
other legitimate purposes, such as meeting our legal obligations and enforcing our terms of service, and
security purposes.
In some cases, we store your information for longer (for example when we need to keep to legal requirements).
Click on + on the right to learn more.
The period we keep your information for depends on factors such as:
the type of information
why it has been collected and is being processed
business needs (for example, creating backups so we can restore our services after a disaster), and
any legal requirements we must keep to.
For example, we keep the content of your email account for as long as your account is active. To keep your account active you must log in at least once every 12 months. If your account becomes inactive, your mailbox will be automatically deleted and cannot be restored. If your account continues to be inactive for a further six months, making it inactive for a total of 18 months, your account will be automatically scheduled for deactivation and deletion by our systems. We will tell you using your alternative communications channel (if you have set one up) before this happens.
Please note that paid subscriber accounts remain active during the subscription period regardless of account activity.
We work with Yahoo companies (our affiliates) and other companies in different countries. These countries may have privacy and data protection laws which are different from those in your country.
When we transfer your information, we rely on appropriate safeguards being in place to protect information that is transferred to other countries.
Click on + on the right to learn more about these safeguards.
When we transfer information to our affiliates or companies in other countries, we make sure that safeguards are in place to protect the information. The safeguards we rely on are:
adequacy decisions
, if the recipient is in a country that is considered ‘adequate’ by the EEA and the UK, and
standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or the United Kingdom.
The countries we transfer personal information to include Australia, the United Kingdom, India, the United States, Canada, Singapore, Taiwan and Israel.
We may rely on other conditions to transfer your information, such as when the transfer is necessary:
to keep to a contract that has been entered into, in your interests, between the data controller and another party
to establish, bring or defend legal claims
for important reasons of public interest, or
to protect the vital interests of a person.
If you have any questions about the standard contractual clauses, or would like to get a copy of them, you can contact us using our
privacy form
or the contact information provided in the section below.

Yahoo offers business-to-business advertising, analytics, content, and measurement services through products like Flurry and Yahoo Native Marketplace (the “
Yahoo B2B Services

Yahoo Privacy Policy
applies to the collection, use, storage, sharing and retention of your personal data associated with your B2B account with us (“
Enterprise Account
”).
This Yahoo B2B Privacy Policy (“
B2B Privacy Policy
”) provides further details into our practices relating to the processing of data associated with your Enterprise Account when you use our Yahoo B2B Services. In the event of a conflict between this B2B Privacy Policy and the
Yahoo Privacy Policy
, this B2B Privacy Policy prevails.
If you have separate contractual agreements with us concerning our collection, use, or disclosure of your Enterprise Account data, those agreements control and supersede anything stated in this B2B Privacy Policy.
Business information
Business information includes your full name and business name, email address, telephone number, address, and other work-related information you provide to us for your Enterprise Account.
We use this information to send you emails or other communications, consistent with providing our services (such as service and product feature updates and notices), and the permissions you give us.
Data that you provide to us when you use our Yahoo B2B Services
When you use your Enterprise Account, we collect information including:
advertising campaigns you place or manage
publisher inventory you make available to Yahoo for analytics or monetization purposes
apps you manage via the Yahoo B2B Services including information regarding audiences, clicks, impressions, conversions, campaign metrics such as click-through rate, analytics, and payments.
We do so in order to provide the Yahoo B2B Services to you, improve our services, and develop new services or service features.
Cookies
We use cookies and other technologies for a number of purposes, including:
to analyse your use of the Enterprise Account
for authentication of your Enterprise Account
as described in the
Yahoo Privacy Policy
and the
Cookie Policy
.
You can manage your cookie and/or device settings, but if you do so, some Yahoo B2B Service functionality may be affected.
How do you manage your data subject rights?
Our Yahoo B2B Services give you various controls to manage certain aspects of your Enterprise Account. However, the platform that we provide to our consumers to manage and control their use of personal data does not work for Enterprise Accounts. If you would like to exercise certain data subject rights regarding your Enterprise Accounts, such as account erasure, please complete our
Privacy Form
. If you are a European Economic Area resident and you wish to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can do so via email at
