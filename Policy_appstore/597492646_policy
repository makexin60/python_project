Changes to this privacy policy
This privacy notice explains how the Pearson family (Pearson Education, Inc, Pearson Education Limited and their group companies use personal data. We have a consistent approach across our business where possible, but personal data collection and processing is sometimes different depending on the products and services that you use (our "Services"). That is why we have included privacy information in the user journeys of our Services (e.g. “just in time notices” at the point of personal data collection) which should be read together with this policy so that you have a clear understanding of how we collect and use your ‘personal data’ and 'personally identifiable information' – which is information that can be used on its own or with other data to identify, contact, or locate a person (for example your name, nickname or an online identifier) (for the purposes of this notice 'personal data').
1. Who are we?
We are a multinational provider of education, training and assessment/verification services. We work with students who come to us directly, and with corporations, schools and other academic institutions who may instruct us to process personal data on their behalf.  Our Services include:
Assessments, Qualifications and Certification Programs:
we make available assessments, including clinical assessments, and award qualifications. We do this through other organizations (for example academic institutions, professional bodies) and directly to students.
Language Learning:
we provide
courses, tools, and assessments for example English Language Learning which enable students to gain and evidence new skills and qualifications.
Workforce Skills:
we work with employers to help them to better understand and upskill their employees. We also work with employees to help them keep track of their learning pathways, and progress towards accreditations and achievements.
Virtual Schools:
we host virtual schools for students who cannot access school in person, for example if they are overseas.
Higher Education:
we provide textbooks and course materials directly to higher and further education institutions. In addition to providing traditional hard copy textbooks, we run a subscription Pearson+ service through which students can access digital texts on a subscription basis – depending on your configuration this may include sharing of reading progress with your academic institution.
As explained above, whilst we try to have a consistent approach across our business where possible, our data protection responsibilities may vary depending on the Services that you use. That is why we have included privacy information in the user journeys of our Services (e.g. “just in time notices” at the point of data collection) which should be read together with this policy so that you have a clear understanding of how we process your personal data.
For any questions regarding how we use your personal data, you can contact us at:
Data Protection Officer for the EU and UK: Pearson, 80 Strand, London, WC2R 0RL
EU Representative: Pearson Benelux B.V. (PIB), Kabelweg 37, Amsterdam, 1014 BA, Netherlands

2. What personal data do we use?
This will depend on the product or service, or type of user "you" are (i.e. student, parent, teacher, instructor, employee, or employer) so please refer to the ‘just in time’ notices and any FAQs accessible within the product or service.
There are some activities that we would like to make you aware of.  We will inform you when these processing activities are relevant. The personal data that we use broadly falls into the following categories:
Information you provide / information collected during your use of the Service(s)
Registration and profile information that we use to set up an account or provide you with access to our Services (e.g., your name (and preferred name), country, city, date of birth, email address, username and password, marketing preferences, your group or grade, institution, course, or class identifier). There is additional (optional) registration data that can be provided, including gender or native language. We might also capture the reason you have signed up for a product or service, – which we aggregate for survey purposes.  You can also upload a profile picture which may be used on certificates issued and within the user experience where relevant to the product or service.
Examinations and certifications. Personal data that forms part of your work that is examined or assessed, when you ask for special arrangements and reasonable adjustments for you to perform an examination We will also record your unique candidate number; the results of the examinations that you take; certificates of examination awarded to you; the outcome of any investigation conducted by Pearson into any examination taken by you; the outcome of any appeal by you that is determined by Pearson; and correspondence that is issued to your learning  center or other third parties by Pearson.
Educational Courses and Tutoring. If you register for or purchase educational courses, or online tutoring offered through or by Pearson, personal data will be collected and processed for the purpose of delivering such educational courses to you. This personal data may include assignments, student coursework, responses to interactive exercises, assessments, scores, grades, and teacher/instructor comments. Personal data collected by an educational institution or education provider in connection with their courses and programs are subject to the privacy policies of such educational institution or education provider.
Purchase information for individuals over 18, personal data associated with the purchase of a product or service (e.g. postal address, phone number and payment information) must be shared. The sharing of this personal data is mandatory and necessary for us to fulfill the contract.
Proof of identity where permitted by law, we require proof of identity, such as  government issued ID that you upload (e.g. passport / driver's license) to extract your name, photograph and expiration date and compare this to a selfie you will be asked to take for the purpose of verifying the authenticity of your ID and matching it to the name and profile picture you give us when you create your profile. This relies on face matching technology using artificial intelligence to ensure that your photographs match but will be shared with Pearson’s team of human reviewers if a mismatch is identified (so you will not be, automatically denied access to our Services).
Customer services information which we collect when you contact us about our Services or otherwise interact with us.  For example, if you complete a questionnaire or contact form on a webpage or otherwise request help or information from us, or if you complain about the performance of our Services and send us screenshots of errors that you received when using our Services.  We will also collect information as to how you contacted customer services, including the channel of communication that you use.
User generated data for example personal data contained in documents you upload to our Services, or personal data you share when you support or participate in our forums or customer communities (which may be public or restricted to particular groups or individuals, depending on the circumstances and any preferences you may set).
Data generated by AI some of the data we process about you will be created or processed using automated technologies. For example, we frequently use algorithms as part of our scoring processes to drive consistency and eliminate bias, we also use these artificial intelligence (AI) tools as part of our language learning applications. This will generally depend on the product or service so please see the just-in-time notices and any FAQs that can be accessed within that product and service. For further information please also see section (Automated Decision-Making).
We utilize anonymized and pseudonymized data to enhance the training of our Pearson AI models. This approach ensures that while your data contributes to the development of smarter, more efficient AI, your identity remains strictly protected. We strictly adhere to data protection regulations, ensuring that direct identifiers are never employed in our training processes. Our sophisticated algorithms process this data to support the continuous improvement of our AI systems, all while upholding the highest standards of privacy and security.
Video, image, and audio recordings which we collect in connection with your participation in a virtual classroom, or during an online assessment or examination. This may involve including images of you, and the audio recordings of your spoken responses and background noise taken during your practice tests so that you can complete the test and receive a score and so that we can fully simulate the test environment for you during practice tests. Note that during these practice tests, we will not be using the face and voice matching technology described in Use of video and recordings) to verify your identity or to identify cheating flags. Please see Use of video and recordings for more information.
Data that we collect automatically
Location information (including IP address) which we use to provide you with relevant content based on the country you are logging in from. Also, other device and cookie information (where we have your permission if required by law), login data and device information to provide more personalized content better suited to your needs as a user. Certain services may also offer you the opportunity to share your specific location (via a mobile or other device) in order to access location specific benefits and participate in community events, however such options will always require express consent from an adult and can be withdrawn at any time. Please see the cookie policy accessible when you access the product or service for more information.
Activity and usage information generated in the course of your using our Services, such as the content you view and post, preferences, responses to interactive exercises, assessment activity and results, teacher or instructor comments, books you have read, assignments that have been taken or assigned and teacher/instructor comments, grades or scores.

Data we obtain from third party sources
Accounts created on your behalf
– we may receive registration and profile data about you for example when another person such as your parent/guardian, teacher, school, or academic institution arranges for your access to our Services on your behalf.
Educational Program Support
- if you enroll in an eligible educational program, we may receive personal data from the educational institution for the purpose of providing educational program support services to you. These support services may include course selection and registration assistance, degree audits and assistance to help you be successful and stay on track to complete an educational program and assist you in obtaining financial aid. The personal data may include information about your coursework, grades and other educational records, together with any other personal data that you may choose to share or that may be requested to enable us to provide appropriate support.
Enrolment Support
. If you contact or work with an enrolment advisor, we may collect personal data so that we can help you explore eligible educational options, apply for enrolment in eligible educational programs and seek financial aid. The personal data may include information about your employment history and educational background, such as employers, work experience, schools, areas of study, grades, transcripts and other educational records, together with personal financial data and any other data that you may choose to share or that may be requested in the application and enrolment process for an eligible educational program and financial aid.
Assessments and feedback
– collected from your teachers/instructors/assessors, for example your assessment results, grades, scores and instructors' comments.
Third party product links.
For example if you use a Service to obtain a personalized learning pathway that includes courses from third party providers, those third party providers may provide Pearson with limited data relating to your activity on that course including whether course checkout/onboarding is completed, start and end dates, what was charged for the course, whether or not it was completed and if a certificate was provided upon completion. If this data sharing takes place that will be made clear as part of the Services and before any data sharing takes place.
From your assessment center.
Pearson is likely to be informed of any personal data that you provide to your center which is relevant to the Pearson qualification you are taking.
Special Category Data
Certain categories of personal data, such as race, ethnicity, religion, health, sexuality or biometric data are classified as “special categories of data” and benefit from additional protection under data protection legislation. Pearson will obtain sensitive personal data about you from any of the above sources about the following, where applicable:
your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs and sexual orientation, for purposes such as equality monitoring or providing access arrangements;
your health, for purposes such as providing access arrangements and/or special consideration;
your biometric information, for purposes such as the use of face and voice matching technology (please see section (
Use of video and recordings
) for more information);
alleged or actual crimes relating to examinations that you take, such as alleged fraud.
Please note that where we use our third-party services to Support our own Service (which may include ID verification and facial recognition), those third parties may use the data captured about you for the purposes of improving their technology. Where this activity takes place, it will be signposted, is subject to their own privacy notices and we will link to that privacy notice.
3. How do we collect your personal data?
We collect your personal data in the following ways:
Directly when you or someone acting on your behalf (normally a parent or guardian but potentially a teacher or institution if they seek to register you for the Services) provide personal data. When you interact with a product or service or when you engage with our emails. Other examples include when you register to use a product or service, contact us (online or offline) or purchase a subscription for one of our Services.
Indirectly from specified third parties. This will depend on the product or service so please see the specific statements in the user journeys. This includes personal data from schools / similar institutions (if you have a school access code to access one of our Services). It also includes data from Google where you sign-up using a Google account for authentication purposes. We may also obtain your data from third parties so we can update, confirm or add to the data we collect, such as the validation of postal addresses or credit card information.
We may also collect publicly available information, including the use of web scraping technologies in accordance with applicable local laws, ensuring that such collection respects your rights and freedoms.
Note:
Some of our Services are available for children (which we define as individuals under 18). If that is the case, we will present information on our data processing in a child friendly way or ask the parent / guardian to explain the relevant points of our privacy notice or share the privacy notice with them where they sign-up on their child's behalf.
4. What about children's personal data?
Pearson recognizes its responsibility to keep children safe online and the need to put additional privacy protections in place to keep younger users safe when they access our Services. As a result, we only collect the minimum data about children that is needed to deliver the service and some features have age-gates to prevent children from inadvertently accessing them or turning them on.
When we work on behalf of Schools
Some of our Services are delivered directly to and on behalf of schools or other academic institutions. In these scenarios, whilst information related to students is shared with us so that students may access our Services, the schools will maintain control over and responsibility for children's personal data. It is the responsibility of the schools to supervise the students and notify parents (if appropriate) in these cases. Please consult your school's (or academic institution's) privacy notice for more information.
When our services are delivered directly to children (and their parent/guardian)
Generally, when our Services are aimed at children or are likely to be accessed by children, we:
take steps to ensure that parents are informed of our collection and use of their children’s personal data and are able to control that use. This can include notifying parents and guardians of our practices with regard to their children’s data and provide them with context specific emails and push notifications to alert them to changes in settings relevant to their children’s personal data;
require a responsible adult’s name and email address and participation in the registration process (parents and guardians may also be required to register and control accounts on behalf of very young children on the understanding that control of the account will transfer to the child when they are old enough if the account is still active);
collect only the minimum data about children that is needed to deliver the service;
default all ancillary data processing activities (e.g. profiling, marketing, data sharing and geo-location) to off and only activate them upon the instruction of a parent (which will usually be done by the parent from within the child’s account) and further to the application of the relevant measures / alerts to the users;
give parents and guardians access to their children’s personal data, or the ability to request it, and to ask us to update or delete their child’s personal data.
Please note that we may require parents or guardians to verify their identity for the purposes of providing consent. This may include credit card verification, the use of government ID or other technology such as facial recognition software. Where such verification is required, we will not retain the data gathered in the course of verification but will instead keep a record of the check that was made after which parents or guardians may be able to confirm their identity via a PIN code, password or similar security feature.
A Privacy Notice for Children is also available

5. What is the purpose and lawful basis for collecting personal data?
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
Ultimately, we collect personal data for the purpose of bringing you the best possible experience when using our Services helping you track your lifetime of learning – whether that be to facilitate account registration, communicate with you, market research and service improvement, personalizing your experience, managing integrations with third party technologies and to comply with laws and regulations and defend and exercise our legal rights.  Our basis for doing this is:

perform a contract
(e.g. to provide the Services purchased or accessed);
with your
consent
(e.g., for marketing activities), which can be withdrawn at any time; and/or

legal obligations

for a variety of business purposes which are in our
legitimate interests
as a commercial provider of educational products and services (as described in further detail on a service-by-service basis via the just in time notices).
If we process sensitive / special categories of personal data (for example biometrics or health data) this requires an additional lawful basis which will either be when it is necessary for reasons of
substantial public interest
(to prevent fraud or cheating) on the
basis of law
which is appropriate to the aim pursued or your
consent.
We have set out a description of all the ways we will use your personal data and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so, in the table below.

Processing on behalf of institutional customers
Some of our Services are provided on behalf of third parties, for example on behalf of an educational institution or partner (for example your employer) with whom you are affiliated. Where that is the case, the institution in question will be the controller of your personal data it is their responsibility to inform you of the purpose and lawful basis of their processing activities. This will commonly be the case where an institutional customer has purchased access to our Services on your behalf.
Where this is the case, your personal data will only be used in accordance with the institutional customer's lawful instructions. This typically involves:
processing your personal data to provide the Services. For instance, processing email addresses for learners in order to issue passwords securely and to send out service messages where necessary;
to communicate with users regarding service updates and in accordance with this privacy policy;
for a variety of services, including digital learning services:
providing schools (or other academic institutions) with access to the information we hold about their students;
analysis of users' use and progress across the service so that we can help learners make progress with their learning. For instance, to evaluate the educational efficacy and effectiveness of the services and to make appropriate recommendations to users and institutional customers based on this evaluation;
For more information, please visit the privacy notice on the website of your educational institution, employer or such other third party who provided you with access to our Services.
Notwithstanding the above, depending on the Service in question there may be instances when our customer (your employer or academic institution) accepts that we have [limited] rights to process your data as a controller in accordance with this Notice, for example to administer your account/relationship with us, to anonymize your personal data ensuring individual privacy while enabling data utilization and to use analytics to improve our Services. We will let you know when this is relevant using just-in-time notices.
6. Use of video and recordings
Some of our Services, for example online assessments and examinations take images, and audio or video recordings of you. This can include your spoken responses and background noise taken during tests. We do this:
to collect your responses so that you can receive a score;
to simulate the test environment for you during practice tests;
to verify that the correct person is taking the test;
to proctor the test to check that you are not cheating.
This includes use of special category face and voice personal data, and matching technology provided by our service providers, using artificial intelligence to ensure that the test responses match the reference voice and photograph we have on file for you and that there are not any cheating “flags” raised during your test.
This technology does not involve real-time surveillance and flags do not track emotional behaviors like your facial movements during the test, but will track whether the recording matches against the data we hold on file for you based on objective pre-defined criteria.
Where a flag is raised, automated or otherwise Pearson’s human reviewers will review any mismatch in IDs and/or where potential cheating has been identified and, in those cases, we will not release a test completion certificate and will either (i) issue a free retest; or (ii) where cheating has clearly taken place and this has been confirmed through human review, we may suspend your account. You have the right to appeal any account suspensions, see our websites for our security requirements and policies.
Note that during these practice tests, we will not be using the technology mentioned above to verify your identity or to identify cheating flags.
We will also process still or video images from your device during some of our online learning services, for example to allow you to participate in virtual classrooms.
Please note in some instances we will use third parties to support facial recognition and ID services for matching during tests and assessments. Those third parties may use the data captured about you for the purpose of improving their technology. Where this activity takes place, it will be signposted, is subject to their own privacy notice and we will link to that privacy notice
Visitor Data and CCTV Monitoring in our offices
At Pearson, we are committed to ensuring the safety and security of our employees, visitors, and assets. As part of this commitment, we collect and process certain data when individuals visit our offices. We believe in transparency regarding our data processing practices, including the use of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) systems.
In addition to CCTV footage, we may collect, and process other data related to your visit, such as: your name and contact details, the purpose of your visit, and the time and date of your entry and exit. This information is collected for security and administrative purposes and is retained in accordance with our retention schedule.
We are committed to transparency regarding our use of CCTV. Clear signage is placed in areas where CCTV cameras are operating, informing individuals that they are being recorded and the purposes of the surveillance.
7. Account linking
Some of our Services provide you with the ability to connect your account to other platforms and services. For example, some digital learning services allow learners to connect their accounts to Google Drive (and similar platforms) so they upload/download documents directly from or into it.
Before you connect to a third-party platform, you will receive a prompt asking you to click "Allow" to enable the Services to connect to the third-party service (e.g. Google Drive). In Google Drive, you may remove this connection in the My Account settings for your Google account at any time.
Pearson will use this connection to access the linked service only for the purpose of uploading or downloading documents that you specifically select with limited metadata to allow identification and retrieval, so that you can access and use the documents within the Services or download them to the third-party service. Pearson will use, process and store these documents and associated personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.
8. Automated decision making
In some instances, our use of your personal data will result in automated decisions being taken (including profiling) that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.
Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically based on a computer determination (using software algorithms), without our human review.  For example, we use automated decisions as part of our scoring processes and as part of our language learning applications.  This helps us to drive consistency and mitigate human bias. We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal data is subject to automated decision-making, for example When we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision.  You can exercise this right by contacting us at
dataprivacy@pearson.com
.
9. Marketing communications and opting out
Depending on our relationship with you, and the service you use, we will send you marketing communications where you have not told us that you wish to unsubscribe from marketing, or where you signed up to receive such updates. Contact details for teachers, learners who are 18 or over, and adult subscribers to the Services may be used for these purposes:
to contact the user with more information about our Services and those of our group companies, except where the user has told us not to;
to invite the user to participate in surveys, discussions and prize draws and ask for the user's views on our Services via online surveys and discussion forums.
participation in surveys and discussion forums is entirely voluntary. Users may unsubscribe from being contacted for these purposes at any time. Survey information will be used for market research with the aim of improving our Services.
Marketing will only be sent to any user aged under 18 registered to use the Services where permitted by law and subject to having obtained prior consent, which may include verified parental consent where appropriate.  Such consent may be withdrawn at any time.
We will not send marketing emails to a user who has opted out of receiving them. Any marketing communications we send will include an unsubscribe link at the end of the email.
10. How long will we store your personal data or personally identifiable information?
We will keep your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we are processing your personal data unless the law permits or requires longer. For example:
Pearson services.
When you use our Services directly, or another creates a profile on your behalf. We will generally keep your personal data for the entire duration you use our Services and a reasonable period after. In general, after a year or so of inactivity Pearson reserves the right to email users that their account will be deleted after six months if there is no further activity.
Information kept for longer periods.
The nature of some of our Services for example Virtual Schools, Qualifications mean it is appropriate for us to keep your data for longer periods.  We will always retain it for longer if the law requires this. For example:
It is necessary to keep
qualifications information
(including candidate name, gender, address, examination result, qualification(s) awarded, grade information) for a minimum of forty years and sometimes indefinitely.
In relation to Safeguarding Records regarding children and records of concern about adult behavior towards children, certain safeguarding information is retained for a longer period.
Where a longer period is required by law for example, we keep invoices and certain payment information for 6 years plus the relevant financial year in which the invoice was issued.
Information kept for shorter periods.
We store certain videos, images, and audios for up to six months after a test or virtual lesson is complete.
The specific periods we keep your personal data differ depending on the nature of the Services or products you receive from the different parts of our business, so please see the FAQs that can be accessed within that product and service.
11. Disclosures and transfers
Disclosures to Group Companies
We may disclose personal data or personally identifiable information to other companies within the Pearson family, so that we can analyze, test and develop new exciting features for our Services.
With your consent (where required by law), we would share your personal data with the Pearson family so that they can inform you about the relevant Services that our group companies offer - these would only be products and services which we think you would be interested in. Please note information on individuals aged under 18 will not be shared with group companies for marketing purposes.
Disclosures to Businesses, Partners and Trusted Organizations
For certain Services, we work closely with employers and educational institutions who are making the service available to staff and learners. This can involve the sharing of personal data with those parties for purposes such as safeguarding, monitoring application usage/progress, and data relating to misconduct, cheating or misuse of systems.  They may have their own privacy notices for their processing of your personal data as a controller, so please make sure you request this and read them.
Other Disclosures
We may disclose personal data in the following circumstances:
when we share it with external providers and data processors such as data centers, web hosts, cloud storage and cloud software providers, customer support providers, payment processors, debt collectors, accountants, insurers and other providers which assist us with the delivery of our Services;
when we share it with prospective sellers or buyers of our business or assets (and their professional advisors) to investors and our professional advisors, including in the event that we experience financial difficulties;
for learners under 18, with the parent / guardian, where they have purchased access to the product or service on behalf of the learner;
when you give us consent or request us to share your data (for example, to send certificates confirming completion of a test to an employer and/or institution or as part of a virtual classroom so they can provide feedback on assessments. This data sharing can be revoked by users at any time); and
when we are required or requested to share it with regulators, law enforcement, courts and other relevant parties for the purpose of enforcement action, legal or contractual compliance and reporting purposes.  Also, to enforce our terms of use, to ensure your safety and that of other learners and to protect our rights and property or those of others.
Data transfers
We are part of a global organisation and use global service providers. Accordingly, data may be processed and shared outside of the country in which you live, however, we will only do this in compliance with local laws and where we have appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient of your data provides the same standard of protection as required by applicable data protection laws.
Where you are a resident of the European Union or the United Kingdom, we will only transfer your personal data: (i) to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission for personal data listed here (or equivalent in the United Kingdom); and/or (ii) where we have specific contracts approved by the European Commission and information Commissioner’s Office which give personal data the same protection. The safeguards we use include:
the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021;
the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses together with the UK Addendum.
This is how transfers of personal data between our group companies will be safeguarded.  All group companies are required to protect personal data that they process from Europe (and the UK) in accordance with European Union (and UK) data protection law.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. Please note that some sensitive commercial information may be redacted from the Standard Contractual Clauses. We have also implemented Standard Contractual Clauses with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

Depending on the country you are in, you may have different rights in relation to your personal data.
Where you are a resident of the European Union or the United Kingdom:

Our role in relation to the personal data will be confirmed to you in the "just in time notices" and in the terms and conditions.
For Services in the United Kingdom and Europe, Pearson Education Limited or Pearson UK Limited are normally to be the controlling Pearson entity, but further specific details are available in the terms and conditions applicable to your Service.

Política de Privacidade - Português
Introduction
Pearson, its Affiliates, and its agents (
“Pearson”
) are committed to data security and the fair and transparent processing of personal data. This privacy policy describes how Pearson treats the information you provide to us or that we otherwise collect. This Privacy Policy also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
“You”
refers to the person or entity using the Service. The
“Service”
is the digital credentialing and certification functionality, associated insights and connection to relevant career, education and training opportunities provided through any website or application offered by Pearson.
“Personal Data”
includes the data we collect directly from you as well as personal data from Issuers (defined below) and Third-Party Services (defined below). This Privacy Policy sets out how we will treat the Personal Data which you provide to us in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.
We will not share your Personal Data except on a need-to-know basis with other companies under common ownership or control with Pearson (“
Affiliates”)
, our attorneys, auditors, consultants, and service providers who are under confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.
Pearson owns and operates Credly.com and YourAcclaim.com. This Policy, together with our website terms of use and any other documents referred to in them, sets out the basis on which Pearson processes Personal Data.
Please read this Policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are, how and why we collect, store, use and share personal data, your rights in relation to your personal data, how to contact us and supervisory authorities in the event that you would like to report a concern about the way in which we process your data.
This Privacy Policy describes our broadest potential use of your Personal Data, although we may actually make far less use. The basis for our processing of your Personal Data is your informed consent. No law requires you to provide us with your Personal Data. You may withdraw your consent for us to process your Personal Data at any time, but that may preclude you thereafter from using the Website and the Service. We will delete your Personal Data following the withdrawal of your consent, however, such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal.
Pearson collects Personal Data when you choose to submit it through e-mail, an online form, or other method. We also collect information through cookies (see “
Pearson Use of ‘Cookies
’
”).
Pearson also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to our websites, including but not limited to, internet protocol (“IP”) address (a computer's numerical Internet address), third party websites from which visitors access our website, type of web browsers used, and pages viewed. Such information may include Personal Data.
By your use of the Service you consent to our use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Who are we?
Credly is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NCS Pearson, Inc with an ultimate parent company of Pearson plc.
The Pearson Service is an internet-based, hosted platform designed to enable subscribers to the Service (
“Issuers”
) to issue digital badges and credentials (
“Credentials”
) to individuals who meet prescribed requirements (
“Users”
), and for those Users to display the Credentials online on the Service or on third party sites, as elected by Users.
We may provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of, or with, Pearson under confidentiality agreements to help Pearson provide the Service. They may also assist Pearson in communicating with you about the Service and about offers from Pearson and our partners, where you have provided us consent to do so.
For the purposes of the GDPR, Pearson is the ‘processor’ of certain types of Personally Identifiable Data provided by Issuers and the ‘controller’ of other types of Personally Identifiable Data provided directly to us by Users. Pearson offers a Data Protection Agreement (DPA) for qualifying organizations, which you can find online at https://info.credly.com/data-processing-addendum.
You may contact our Primary Point of Contact for data privacy and security with any questions, comments or concerns about this policy by sending an email to
privacy@credly.com
.
What personal data do we collect?
We may collect and process the following personal data:
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US
To register for or use the Service, you will be prompted to give us certain required information about yourself, such as your name and email address. When you configure your account settings, you may enter additional, optional information about yourself. You may, at times, also send us an e-mail which may contain not only your e-mail address, but other information about you, including home or business addresses, telephone numbers, or account details. The information you give us may also include statements you make on the Service such as testimonials, services reviews, or other statements that may identify you personally.
When an Issuer issues you a Credential, we will provide you with a user ID (the e-mail address provided by the Issuer) and account activation e-mail for you to access the Service and create a user “profile” for use as described below. Alternatively, you may directly create an account on the Service by entering your email address, name, and country. When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your profile, which contains the information supplied to us by you or the Issuer. In addition to the information required to establish your account, including your name, email, password and country, you may provide some or all of the following information, including but not limited to, a photograph of yourself, a short biographical blurb, your state/province, your city, your zip code, your current employer, your current job title, your birth year, and your website URL. You will be able to update or correct any of the contact information in your profile at any time. You may receive certain e-mails relating to your use of the Service. If you receive another Credential from other Issuers, your user ID will be authorized to access the Service, and your contact information will be added to the participant list for that Issuer.
If you have consented or opted in to receiving news and updates from Pearson on professional growth or further education opportunities, you have the right at any time to prevent us from further contacting you by following the unsubscribe or opt-out instructions included in the relevant email or through the privacy tools provided to you through the Service.
We may use your Personal Data to contact you regarding your use of the Service, for customer support purposes, and to inform you of updates, modifications and other matters relating to the Service, and information about others services that we offer in accordance with your subscription preferences. You may decline to receive mail or e-mail from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service by selecting the opt-out link contained in any such e-mail or by contacting us at
privacy@credly.com
.
You may request that Pearson provide third-parties access to your publicly accessible personal information. Pearson will not provide your personal information to a third-party without your consent.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
Pearson also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service, a log of users' IP addresses, the third-party Website from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance (collectively,
“Usage Log Information”
). For purposes of maintaining and enhancing Service performance and security, Pearson may use Usage Log Information, information about your browser, and other local computer settings. We also may use Usage Log Information to tailor our communications to you about the Service, and contact you in relation to providing support. We also may aggregate Usage Log Information to create or publish statistical analyses and reports about Service usage. We will not authorize the publication of Personal Information about any user without the prior written consent of such person.
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM ISSUERS
Issuers provide Personal Information to us, including first name, last name, email address, and Credential. The use of information collected from Issuers shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which these Organizations have engaged Pearson.
Pearson collects information directly from the Issuer or directly from the User. If you would no longer like to be contacted by one of the Issuers that use our service, please contact the Issuer that you interact with directly.
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct or amend inaccurate Credentials should direct their query to the Issuer. We retain Personal Information we process on behalf of the Issuers for as long as needed to provide services to the Issuers and the Users and in compliance with all applicable personal information retention laws. Individual Credentials and an User’s entire account may be deleted by the User at any time directly through the Service. Pearson will retain this Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may statistically aggregate in non-person-specific form information collected to improve our websites, our quality controls, operations management, security processes, future marketing and promotional efforts, and the overall Service in attempt to better understand our users’ interests and preferences. In some cases, we may transfer this information to our third-party service providers. By using this Site, you consent to this non-personally identifiable data aggregation and the use and transmission of this aggregated statistical data as outlined above.
How do we use your personal data?
ADDITIONAL USES OF SERVICE INFORMATION
In addition to the uses described above of the information received in connection with your use of the Service, Pearson uses and, where specified, shares your information:
To display Credentials.
Pearson may use your information to display Credentials that you receive through the Service or through Third-Party Services on the Pearson website or on third party websites or applications that you choose to share your personal information to.
To provide support or other services
that you have requested, and to respond to your inquiries.
To engage in transactions with you
, including contacting you about your account or transactions.
To notify you of relevant opportunities
such as new product releases and service developments, related facts or programming that may be relevant to you.
To improve quality and facilitate use of the Service.
To operate the Service through the assistance of third parties.
Pearson may use services from third-party service providers, such as hosting services and software developers, in support of its operation of the Service. When doing so, we will take steps to ensure that such service providers implement appropriate privacy and security measures consistent with this Privacy Policy to safeguard against the unauthorized use or disclosure of your information. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
To comply with legal requirements.
In addition, we may also disclose information about you as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights or protect our operations or users or others investigate fraud, or in response to legal processes or governmental investigations in accordance with our internal policy on access by governmental authorities, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.
Privacy Preferences
The Service allows you to customize the information about yourself that is made accessible to others. When you establish an account, the Service applies default settings. Default settings also apply to new features introduced on the Service. Credentials issued to you will default to the “public” setting. You may activate a “private” setting such that the Credential will no longer be publicly accessed at any time, on a Credential-by-Credential basis. Until you terminate your use of the Service, the fact that you are a user, as indicated by the public display of your full name and avatar, is available to others on the Service. Review your privacy settings regularly to ensure that they match your preferences.
Security
Pearson takes appropriate and reasonable precautions to implement appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of Personal Information provided or generated through the Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use your information only in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software or other encryption technology, which encrypts information you input. Wherever appropriate, we obfuscate and/or encrypt information in our systems and/or during information transfer. Pearson regularly reviews the cryptographic protocols it uses to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.
Because of the nature of internet and for other reasons, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information, so you should take precautions to protect it when you are on the internet, such as changing passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, using a secure browser and being sure to log off the Service when finished using a shared computer.
Third-Party Sites
The Service may include hyperlinks to third-parties neither owned nor managed by us, and, as described above, you may use certain Third-Party Services in connection with the Credentials issued through the Service. Pearson has no control over these Third-Party Services and your interactions with those third parties are subject to their privacy policies and terms of use.
How long will you keep your personal data?
ACCESS, RETENTION AND DELETION
Upon request Pearson will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your account or contacting us at
privacy@credly.com
.  We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Pearson may retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active and so long as retention is required or permitted in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or otherwise by law. When Pearson deletes your Personal Information, Pearson will do so in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed.
VIEWING OF DATA FOR SUPPORT
For the purpose of providing the Service and associated support including answering any questions you may have, Pearson may view and process your Personal Information from nations outside the EEA that are deemed by the EU to have non-adequate data protection laws, including the United States.
WHERE DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND HOW IS IT PROTECTED?
We take reasonable steps to protect your personal data from loss or destruction.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use procedures and security features consistent with industry practices to try to prevent unauthorized access.

Mondly Languages Privacy Policy
This privacy policy explains how personal data will be used by Mondly in relation to the language learning products and services that link to this policy.
We are sharing this information to explain how your ‘personal data’ and 'personally identifiable information' - that can be used on its own or with other data/information to identify, contact, or locate a person - is being used in connection with our services.
Please read this policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect and use your ‘personal data’ and 'personally identifiable information'.
Who are we?
Mondly is an online language learning platform developed by ATI Studios SRL and is part of the Pearson group (owned by Pearson plc), referred to as "Mondly", "we", "us" or "our" in this policy.
You can contact us at:
Data Protection Officer: 80 Strand, London, WC2R 0RL
EU Representative: Pearson Deutschland GmbH, Kaiserstraße 44, 60329 Frankfurt am Main, Germany
You may also email us at dataprivacy@pearson.com.
When do we collect information?
We collect your information in three key ways:
a) Directly when you (or your parent/guardian) provide information e.g. by registering to use Mondly, contact us (online or offline) or purchase a subscription for one of our products and services.
b) Directly when you interact with Mondly (including if you record your voice as part of the learning process to practice vocabulary and phrases) or when you engage with our email communications - we use cookies and other technologies to collect this information. To find out more, please visit our Cookie Policy.
c) Indirectly from specified third parties (such as Facebook and Google) if you choose to register via a social media platform.
What personal data do we collect from the people that visit our website or use our apps?
When registering on our website or using any of our products and services, including Mondly apps, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, foreign language skills, your interests, and you may provide a profile picture (this might be associated with the photo on your Facebook account if you sign up that way). For some Services, a user may register using an alias name (pseudonym) that is not otherwise associated with personal data provided to Mondly. Note: some of the apps might also include a leadership board noting username, profile pictures and points so an alias name should be provided if you are not comfortable with this being made public to other users.
We also process any other voluntary details that you can save in your profile, and your communication preferences (including if you raise a complaint and/or support query).
We will process your login details: including username and password and similar credentials.
You may elect to record your voice practising the language (but this is optional). Further, you may elect to use our virtual reality app to practice languages in realistic dialogues inspired by events (e.g. check-in to a hotel in Paris). This might involve an element of gamification (and multi-player functionality, where your name and the information you have made available in your profile will be available).
Where you upgrade to premium and/or buy a subscription, you will provide financial information i.e. subscription/purchase information, card details, billing address.
We collect lesson progress and analytics, including information about how you use our services, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, the other users you interact with and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. As users of the Services, learners may also record responses to interactive exercises, scores, grades or activities completed.
We also collect cookie information (where we have your permission, if required by law), log data, device information and IP addresses that help us understand which country you are connecting from to provide more personalized content better suited to your needs as a user. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information.
There is a specific MondlyKIDS app which we recommend is used by children under the age of 15 to ensure they receive an age-appropriate experience as this app can function with minimal data collection (limited to username, email address only).
What is the purpose for collecting the information?
Ultimately, we collect information for the purpose of bringing you the best possible experience when using our products and services. This could include collecting your information for:
registering your account when you create one;
fulfilling the service terms when providing you with our products and services, including honouring your purchase with us and tracking purchases and progress which includes sending periodic emails about lesson reminders and to otherwise make Mondly available to you, for example, we need such information for your account ranking, connecting with other users through social media platforms, adjusting the difficulty level of the app for the user, analysing voice recordings to confirm accuracy of grammar and vocabulary, providing access to content and capturing progress within the application etc;
authorise and authenticate users of our services (and prevent and detect fraud and/or security breaches);
managing leadership boards where we may publish your username, profile information including language combination, scores, online status and date of registration as well as any additional information voluntarily provided;
personalizing your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product and service offerings in which you are most interested;
marketing to you via email, in-app advertisements and/or online marketing. Please note that we do not intentionally send marketing communications to learners aged under 15 unless consent has been provided on behalf of the learners, in which case such consent may be withdrawn at any time. We allow users to unsubscribe at any time by using the link at the bottom of each email or using our preference centre and we honour opt-out/unsubscribe requests as soon as possible;
creating a profile of you e.g. we may combine the data that you have provided to us, or that we have collected via analytical cookies (dropped with your consent) with information from third parties in order to better understand your interests. We want to build a profile of you so that we can send relevant communications and market to you more effectively based on customer audience segments we create – this profiling is not considered “automated decision making” (the process of making a decision with significant consequences by automated means without any human involvement), but we will let you know if that changes;
market research purposes e.g. if you respond to a survey or if we conduct data analytics. Participation in surveys and discussion forums is entirely voluntary. You may unsubscribe from being contacted for these purposes at any time;
improving our products and services, for example through website analytics based on application and system logs data which could include data such as your IP address, internet service provider and browser type, type of computer/device, and details of the website, application or email communication you came from before entering the Services. Please note that we may, from time-to-time, supply third parties with aggregated sets of this data for uses in connection with our Services;
meeting our legal, regulatory, and tax reporting obligations, including to comply with requests from local authorities and government bodies and investigating incidents of potential or suspected breaches of our terms of service or applicable laws. Also to protect and ensure safety of our services and products and our confidential and proprietary information.
Grounds for collecting the information
We require a lawful basis to collect and process your information. This will be:
when information is necessary for us to perform a contract with you (when you purchase a subscription, upgrade to premium and/or accept our terms of use);
with your consent (e.g. we may ask you for specific consent to use your personal data in a particular way);
to comply with our legal obligations (e.g. we might have regulatory obligations to report or share or archive personal data); and/or
for a variety of business purposes which are in our legitimate interests as a commercial provider of educational products and services to grow our brand and protect and enhance our products and services.
How long will we use your personal data
We shall be storing your information as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we are processing your personal data, which may be for the entire duration of your use of our products and services or longer if the law permits or requires – unless you exercise your right to delete certain data where applicable.
To request the deletion of your personal data, please email support[at]mondly[dot]com.
In particular, we retain registration, profile, transaction, and other information for as long as a user maintains their account. Users may request deletion of their account at any time. On receipt of a deletion request, we delete data that it is not required to retain for purposes of legal, tax, accounting, reporting, insurance, litigation, or other regulatory requirements which we will retain for 6 years from collection - during which time we may also use it for purposes of security, fraud prevention and detection. We may be unable to delete a user’s account in certain circumstances, particularly if there is an outstanding credit on the account or an unresolved dispute. Upon resolution of the issue, we will delete the account as described above.
What rights do I have?
Depending on the country you are in, you may have the right to:
(i) request access to and obtain a copy of your personal data and be informed about our processing activities,
(ii) rectify your personal data if it is no longer accurate,
(iii) request the erasure of your personal data if our retention is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected,
(iv) restrict or object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances,
(v) data portability, and
(vi) lodge a complaint with your relevant supervisory authority or regulator (but we ask you to contact us in the first instance).
If you are resident in California, please click this link to find out more information about your specific rights – in particular, we confirm that we don’t sell your personal data.
How do we protect your information?
At Mondly, we maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to maintain the safety of your personal data and take steps to prevent unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss, theft, destruction of or damage to personal data. In particular, our website is scanned on a regular basis for security vulnerabilities to improve your safety when using our products and services.

10.1          The European Commission decides, for the purposes of data protection legislation, whether or not states outside the European Economic Area have “adequate” safeguards for personal data.
The laws in the jurisdiction where the centre and/or you are may not provide adequate safeguards.
10.2          Pearson can lawfully make necessary transfers of your personal data to these overseas locations in some circumstances, for example if they have your explicit consent.  If they ask you for your explicit consent, or if the centre asks you on their behalf for your explicit consent,
it may be the case that Pearson will be unable to make the necessary transfer(s) of your personal data to the Centre or to you unless they obtain your consent
.
10.3          The centre may be in a location that within or outside the United Kingdom, and may be within or outside the European Economic Area.
10.4          Personal data that is disclosed by the centre to Pearson will be transferred into the United Kingdom. Personal data that is disclosed by Pearson to you or the centre (or an examiner) will be transferred from the United Kingdom to the jurisdiction where the centre or you are.  Examiners and other providers of services (such as printing of certificates) may be located in the jurisdiction where the centre or you are, or another jurisdiction.
10.5          Where Pearson transfers your personal data outside of the European Economic Area without first obtaining your consent it will ensure that it has adequate safeguards.
11

11.1          In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal data, including the right to ask us to update and correct your personal data, to request access to and obtain a copy of your personal data, erasure of your personal data if its retention is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected, to restrict or object to the continued processing of personal data in some  circumstances and data portability (if appropriate).
11.2          If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, including to withdraw your consent (where our processing of your personal information relies on your consent), please contact us using the contact details stated below in this Privacy Notice.

Pearson Privacy Statement
1. Introduction
Welcome to the Pearson Privacy Center. This page summarizes how Pearson and its group of companies ("Pearson", "we", "us", "our") use personal data. This page is a summary, it is important you read the Pearson Privacy Center Notice and the privacy information we share whilst you use our services (just in time notices) so that you have a clear understanding about how we use information about you.
For any question regarding how we use your personal data, you can contact us at:
Data Protection Officer: 80 Strand, London, WC2R 0RL
EU Representative: Pearson Benelux B.V. (PIB) Kabelweg 37, Amsterdam, 1014 BA Netherlands
You may also email us at
dataprivacy@pearson.com
.
2. What do we do?
Pearson provides education, training and assessment/verification services around the world (our "Services"). We work directly with individuals such as students, parents, teachers, and other professionals, and provide our Services to institutions (such as schools, universities, employers). More information about this is included in section 1 of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice.
3. What personal data do we collect and use?
The personal data we collect and use broadly falls into the following categories:
Registration, profile, proof of identity and purchase information
Information collected as part of Examinations and certifications and Educational Courses and Tutoring
Customer service and educational/enrolment support information
User generated data (e.g. your participation in forums)
Data generated by AI (e.g. as part of assessment scoring)
Video, image and audio recordings (e.g. collected during virtual classrooms or as part of exam proctoring)
Activity and usage information
Location, application and systems log data
Special category data (e.g. relating to health for access arrangements, biometric face and voice technology to prevent cheating, and other sensitive information for equality monitoring);
More information as to the types of data falling under these categories can be found in section 2 of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice.
4. Why do we collect your personal data?
Subject to the Service you use, the main ways we use personal data are for the purpose of bringing you the best possible experience when using our Services helping you track your lifetime of learning – whether that be to facilitate account registration, communicate with you (including marketing), market research and service improvement, personalizing your experience, to prevent fraud, managing integrations with third party technologies and to comply with laws and regulations and defend and exercise our legal rights.
For more detailed descriptions please see section 5 of the Pearson Privacy Centre Notice.
5. Children's data
The nature of our Services means we often process information about users under the age of 18. We recognize our responsibility to keep children safe online and have put additional protections in place to ensure this. We do this by working closely with parents, and schools, please see section 4 of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice for more information.
6. Use of AI technologies
We use artificial intelligence technologies (for instance, when collecting your video and audio recordings during tests or as part of our scoring processes) in order to, amongst other purposes, drive consistency, eliminate bias and detect instances of cheating. Some of these activities would be carried out automatically and may require the use of your biometric data. For more information about these processing activities please see section 6 and section 8 of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice.
7. How long does Pearson keep my personal data for?
Only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was requested. Some types of information such as those relating to qualifications and virtual schools need to be retained for long periods of time.  More information about this is included in section 10of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice.
8. Does Pearson share my personal data with anyone?
Yes. We share personal data with our group members who help us to deliver and improve our Services. Depending on the Service in question, we also share user personal data with their academic institutions, instructors, employers and/or parent or guardians as appropriate. Your personal data is shared with our suppliers who help us to provide the Services to you. We may also share your personal data with regulators, law enforcement, courts, with our professional advisors, or with other third parties for example in connection with the sale of or investment in our business. More information about this is included in section 11  of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice.
9. Will your personal data stay in your country?
We are part of a global organisation and use global service providers. This means your personal data may be processed outside of the country in which you live. We will only do this in compliance with local laws. For example, for residents in the UK and EU, Pearson complies with legal requirements to enter into Standard Contractual Clauses (and the UK addendum) with data importers. More information about this is included in section 11 of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice.
10. What rights do you have?
Depending on the country you are in, you may have different rights in relation to your personal data. Section 12 of the Pearson Privacy Center Notice includes a detailed description of the rights available to individuals in the European Union or United Kingdom. These include rights to access data, to correct inaccurate data, to object to or request restriction of our processing, to request deletion of data, to request that we transfer your data to another, to opt-out of marketing or to withdraw consent.  You also have the right to complain to a local supervisory authority.
11. Who is the controller of my personal data?
For Services in the United Kingdom and Europe, Pearson Education Limited is normally the Pearson controlling entity, and in the United States and Asia Pacific it is normally either Pearson Education Inc or NCS Pearson Inc. Please refer to the terms and conditions for your service for details. Please note, there may be occasions where the data controller is your employer, or academic institution (i.e. school or university) rather than Pearson, this will be explained to you during your use of the Services.
