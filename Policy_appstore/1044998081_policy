Use via Bluetooth
Nuki uses Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with the Nuki App. We have developed our own encryption protocol for Bluetooth communication. This is how we achieve a high security standard – comparable to common 						security standards like in the online banking sector.
How your data is managed
If you control your Nuki devices via Bluetooth, the following applies: Personal information generated during usage will only be stored on your devices. The communication between Nuki app and Nuki device is based on 						randomly generated, anonymous ID numbers. The digital keys are end-to-end encrypted and always safe from attacks. You don’t need an account. Personal data is neither collected nor transmitted to our servers.
