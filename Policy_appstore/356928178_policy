Targeting cookies for marketing and advertising
These cookies record your visit to our Platforms, the links you have clicked in our Platforms, and the pages you have visited as linked from our Platforms (including, in the case of interest-based advertising, the pages of other websites). We or our partners may use this information to make the advertising displayed on our Platforms and their websites/applications more relevant to your interests. Without these cookies, you will be able to use and enjoy all of the features of our Platforms but the advertisements (“ads”) you see on our Platforms or those of third parties will not be tailored to your preferences in a way that reflects your likely interests based on the audience segments into which we have placed you.
Analytical or performance cookies
These cookies (for example when we use Google Analytics 360 and GumGum Sports) allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to our Platforms and to see how visitors move around our Platforms when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way our Platforms work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
Always Active
These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Platforms. Examples include cookies that enable you to access our Platforms and cookies that ensure content works correctly on your device. Without these, you will not be able to use all of the services we provide. If you decide to opt-out from storing these cookies, certain parts of our Platforms will not work correctly and, in some cases, may not work at all.
Functionality cookies
These cookies enable the features of our Platforms. They recognise you when you return to our Platforms and remember the choices you have made such as the selection of your favourite sports matches or enable notifications. This enables us to personalise our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your time zone, favourite matches, sounds notifications, etc). Without these cookies, you will still be able to use our Platforms, but your experience will be more difficult, and you may not get the best of our services. You will not see content that is relevant to you.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
