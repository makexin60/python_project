Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
I take your privacy very seriously. There are no targeted ads, and I do not sell your information.
Your login information (to third party services) is saved only on your device.
It is only used for authentication with your used sync services and your used third-party services.
iCloud Sync
Some account related information (including settings, feed settings and feed ids/urls, but no login credentials) might be uploaded to iCloud servers, if you choose to use iCloud sync for settings.
Your complete feeds, folders, tags and articles are uploaded to iCloud servers if you use an iCloud based sync account. iCloud is a service provided by Apple, and the data upload can only be access by you and Apple, but not by me.
Third party information
Some of the third party services may require you to register for an account. When syncing with a third party service, they also have a copy of your data. None of this information is collected by me.
Text Extraction
Text extraction goes through a server run by me, which helps keeping your IP from the visited site. The extraction server keeps a count of how often each extraction algorithm is used for a given base domain, but no personal information or exact urls. The counts are needed to decide which algorithm to use in automatic mode.
Third party trackers
Articles or websites may include tracking services. Fiery Feeds blocks all javascript and cookies in the article and text view modes, but not in web view mode. Tracking pixels in articles may still work if loading images is not disabled.
My apps use the following third party services:
Sentry to track crashes and errors.
RevenueCat for validating purchases and managing subscriptions.
