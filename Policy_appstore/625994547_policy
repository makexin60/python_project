Use of cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or other device by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.
General information about the cookies used
When you visit our Website for the first time, the entry page will show information on privacy through a “cookie banner” allowing you to provide your consent to the use of specific cookies or to reject them and manage cookies preferences.

Sharing on social networks
We use a social plug-in to enable you to share our Website’s information on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other Social Media platforms of your choice through “Share” buttons.
For data privacy reasons, we have deliberately opted against the use of direct social network plug-ins on our Website. Instead, we employ an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when. Thus when you visit the Website, data is never automatically transmitted to a social network. Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the social network, i.e. clicking on elements and then clicking on the social network’s icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the social network and sending data to that social network operator, whether or not you are a subscriber of that social network.
We have no influence over the nature or scope of data that social networks may then gather. For information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by social networks and regarding your data privacy rights and relevant configuration settings, see the social networks’ respective data privacy advisories.
Links to third party websites
On certain sections of this Website, we provide links to third party websites which are not subject to this Privacy Notice. This may notably the case for third party registration tools used for registering to our events. These links are provided as a convenience to you; however please be aware that we have no control over these third parties or their websites and that they will have a different privacy notice applying to information collected from you when you are on their websites. We encourage you to read the privacy notices of all websites carefully before providing personally identifiable information.
Storage duration
We will retain your Personal Data only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of the purposes described above or as required by applicable data retention laws and statutory limitation periods for claims
Security and confidentiality
We have implemented technical and organisational measures in accordance with standard industry practices to ensure an appropriate level of security of the Personal Data processed. Nevertheless, security requires efforts from all parties involved. We thus encourage you to contribute to these efforts by taking appropriate security measures yourself, including by using strong passwords and keeping all user names and passwords (if any) confidential.

You may do so by fulfilling a specific request form accessible on our dedicated
Data Subject Rights online platform
