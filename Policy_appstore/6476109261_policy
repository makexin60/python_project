We, either directly or through our Processors, may provide such information to you by email or through personalized online content and advertising through the Website, social media platforms or our online partners. If you initially consent to receive these materials by ticking the appropriate boxes, you can change your mind at any time by notifying us  through
privacy@skylum.com
, or, if applicable, in the unsubscribe link contained in the relevant marketing communication.
We, either directly or through our Processors, may contact you regarding products of others that may be of interest to you, but we will not provide your Personal Data to other businesses for their marketing purposes.

We may share your Personal Data with third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including:
other companies under our control or that are under common control with us may have access to your Personal Data, including Processors, but will adhere to this Privacy Policy;
service providers, including Processors (for example, analytics services, payment service providers, order fulfilment partners, software developers, IT support service providers), business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors, for the performance of any contract we enter into with you, or who provide you with marketing communications;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of the Website or Products;

Where we store your personal data
Products can be accessed and used worldwide.
We may store and hold data collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy on systems located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and may process it outside the EEA, including in instances where the Organization using Products is not based in the EEA, or where Products are accessed by a user who is not a resident of the EEA.
For EEA Residents Only: If Skylum itself is transferring your Personal Data to others outside the EEA, we will adhere to legal requirements to implement safeguards in relation to the transfer. Transferring your Personal Data to certain countries outside the EEA may not require additional safeguards, for example where the country has the benefit of an “adequacy decision” issued by the European Commission. If there has been no adequacy decision for the country (as is the case for the USA), that means that the laws of these countries are not deemed to provide adequate protection for your Personal Data.  In those circumstances, we may implement any mechanism that is approved under data protection laws to ensure that your Personal Data is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with EU, Swiss and UK laws on data protection. These measures could include the following:
ensuring that the recipient is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield; and/ or
implementing EU GPDR standard contractual clauses with the recipient.
For more information, please contact us at
privacy@skylum.com
.
Security
All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. We use technical and organizational measures to safeguard your Personal Data.
If you have a user name and a password which enable you to access Products, you are responsible for keeping these access details confidential.  Please do not share your user name or password with anyone.
Along with anyone with whom we share your Personal Data, we maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures for an appropriate level of security in respect of all Personal Data we process. However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. While we take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to the Website or Products, and you acknowledge that any transmission of data is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use procedures and security features which are appropriate to the type of Personal Data you have provided to make reasonable commercial efforts to prevent unauthorised access or inadvertent disclosure.
Retaining personal data
Even if you request that we erase your data, we may still need to keep it under some circumstances, or may keep it as Anonymous Data.
We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, which includes satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements imposed on us. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, the basis of processing, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
If we anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, we may use such information without further notice to you.
If we are processing Personal Data as part of a Subscription Agreement and you have not agreed that we may use your data for marketing purposes, we will retain your Personal Data on record for no more than the duration of the Subscription Agreement and 6 years thereafter.
Your rights
You have the following rights with regard to your Personal Data:
Access
.  You have the right to access data we hold about you.  This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Rectification or erasure
. You have the right to request that we rectify or delete any Personal Data that we hold about you, unless we have the legal right to retain it, and you may withdraw your consent to our use of your Personal Data. This right does not extend to non-Personal Data. Further, if you request that we erase certain Personal Data required for use of a Product or to enable us to provide services to you, you may no longer be able to use the Product or receive the services. Finally, we will likely need to retain your Personal Data to enable us to carry out any contract with your Organization, and your rights under applicable law to request erasure may be limited accordingly.
Restriction
.  You also have the right to restrict us from processing your Personal Data if the data is inaccurate, the processing is unlawful, or we no longer need your Personal Data for the purposes for which we hold it.
Data portability
. If the legal basis that we rely on for processing your Personal Data (as we describe in the section PURPOSE AND LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA) is either consent, or the performance of a contract with you, or if your Personal Data is being processed automatically then, to the extent feasible and that it does not adversely affect the rights of others, you have the right to ask us to provide you with the Personal Data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. This could include data that we hold that results from observation of your use of the Websites or Products.
Object / change of preferences
. You have a right to request that we stop processing your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party). You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. For example, if you have given your consent to receive updates from us, but have changed your mind, you have the ability to opt out from receiving future marketing communications by clicking the relevant link in any communication you receive, or by contacting us directly.

. You may unsubscribe from our marketing communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our e-mails, updating your communication preferences, or by sending us email us at
