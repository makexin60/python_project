Complaints should be received within 48 hours of the incident to allow us to thoroughly investigate.
When making a complaint, please try to provide sufficient details to assist with our investigation. This includes: date, time, route number, bus number, where you boarded the bus, a description of the driver and details of the actual complaint. Your Easyrider card number (if you used one) or your ticket, if you paid by cash, are very useful to us.
Where your complaint is about a driver’s conduct, Company Policy is that the exact outcome of any investigation will not be disclosed, since this information is of a sensitive nature.
If you are not satisfied with the response from NCT, you can contact
Bus Users UK
who are the approved Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) body for the bus and coach industry.
Timetables and Service Performance
Timetables for all our services are available from the NCT Travel Centre in the Old Market Square, over 200 outlets across the network (for example, libraries, colleges and hospitals), online at
www.nctx.co.uk
and in the NCTX Buses app and by post.
Journey Planning advice and support is available from the NCT Travel Centre.
When changes are made to services, new timetables will be available at least 2 weeks before the start date, with advance warning displayed on all branded buses, on our website, social media and at key bus stops.
The timetable for any service is a guide to the times we aim to operate the bus and our timetables are designed to reflect different traffic conditions across the day.
Services have fixed times at Timing Point stops, which are the only stops they wait at to regulate the service. These are shown in the Official Printed and PDF timetables for each service. Times from other stops are a best estimate of when the bus is likely to depart.
On occasions buses cannot be run at times and frequencies advertised due to reasons beyond our control or that of our subcontractors, and we may have to cancel journeys or divert services where we are unable to operate the advertised route or timetable. This can be due to severe traffic conditions, adverse weather, roadworks, other disruptions or other reasons beyond our control. We reserve the right therefore, to alter, suspend or withdraw a service and to alter the route, bus stops or times of any service without notice or liability to you.
We encourage customers to arrive at the bus stop at least 5 minutes before the scheduled departure time.
Getting On the Bus
For safety reasons, buses will only stop at recognised bus stops to allow passengers to board.
The service number for each service is clearly shown on the bus stop.
As the bus approaches, check the service number and destination on the bus to make sure it is the service you want.
All of our bus stops are “request stops” and you should clearly signal the driver as the bus approaches to let them know you wish to board.
If you need assistance with boarding a bus, please contact our Travel Centre for guidance.
When the bus has stopped, allow passengers to get off the bus first.
Once buses have closed their doors and the driver has signalled to pull away, the bus will not be able to let you board because the driver is committed to re-joining the main traffic flow.
Responsibility for bus shelters and stop infrastructure rests with the local authority.  We are responsible for maintaining up-to-date information at bus stops and employ a dedicated team to provide information at stops.
Paying Your Fare
To speed up journey times and to get you to your destination quicker, we operate an exact fare policy and change is not available on the bus.
Excess fare receipts are available, on request, for passengers who are unable to tender the correct fare. The excess fare can be collected from the NCT Travel Centre upon presentation of valid photo ID.
When boarding the bus, place your money in the coin box near the driver’s cab; present your smart card or contactless payment method to the card reader or show your Mobile Phone ticket screen to the QR card reader (where a QR code is displayed) or driver (where one isn’t displayed).
Please state your destination and/or the ticket type you want to the driver, if paying with cash or contactless (except Tap&Go).
Where you have paid cash or contactless (except Tap&Go), please take your ticket as proof of payment and check that you have the correct ticket for your journey. Please inform the driver at the time of issue in the event of an error because errors cannot be rectified at a later date.
Proof of payment for mobile tickets are emailed to customers and customers who pay using a contactless card or device can view their transaction history online at
www.nottinghamcontactless.co.uk
Please retain your ticket or your smart card, in good condition, and make them available for inspection, when asked for by a member of NCT staff.
The possession of a pre-purchased ticket (e.g. all day ticket, Grouprider, Easyrider, mobile app ticket) is not a guarantee of travel and the Company is not liable for any costs incurred as a result of not being able to travel that are outside of its control (e.g. bus full).
We cannot replace or reissue damaged, lost or mutilated tickets that have been bought on the bus. See the
Easyrider Citycard Terms and Conditions
for details about smart card replacements.
Customers who purchase tickets through the NCTX Buses app are subject to additional NCTX Buses app conditions, as outlined under “Settings” within the NCTX Buses app and
online here
.
Customers who purchase travel on an Easyrider smart card are subject to additional terms and conditions, provided at the time of purchase and available at
www.nctx.co.uk/easyrider
Customers who purchase travel using a contactless card or device are subject to additional terms and conditions, available at
www.nottinghamcontactless.co.uk
Fares
When you make a journey, you have to pay for a ticket on the bus, use a pre-purchased smart card or purchase a ticket through the NCTX Buses App. Tickets must be retained at all times during your journey for inspection by an NCT employee, or any authorised agent or subcontractor.
Payment of a fare covers making a journey on one of our buses and is not a payment to guarantee a seat for your journey. Standing forms part of the overall capacity of the bus and you may have to stand at busy times.
A list of available tickets and prices are contained within the NCT Journey Planner or online at
nctx.co.uk
Tickets are not transferable between passengers whilst making journeys, and can only be used by the person buying the ticket and must not be resold or given away for further use.
Single fares are valid for one journey between two points on the same bus at the time of purchase, no further than the terminus. A break in the journey is not permitted.
Return tickets are only valid on the day of issue. Return tickets are valid for travel between the two points stated on the ticket. When boarding for the return journey, please hand the ticket to the driver for validation, which will be done by punching a hole in the ticket.
On bus issued day tickets, contactless day caps and smartcard products sold in multiples of days, run from 04:30-04:29 for each day.
A fare-table for all services is available for inspection from the driver.
Where a passenger boards between fare stages, the journey is charged from the previous stage. Where a passenger alights between fare stages, the journey is charged to the next stage.
Where a passenger knowingly pays a lower fare than relevant for their journey, and is caught doing so by any on board inspection of tickets by NCT Staff, the passenger must pay for a new ticket. The price of this ticket will be from the point where the original ticket ended to the final destination.
Discounted ‘Child’ fares, are available for customers aged between 5 and 18 inclusive. Under 5s travel free.
Grouprider tickets can be used by up to 5 people, where there has to be at least 1 adult (19 and over) and no more than two adults. A Grouprider can be used by 2 adults travelling together without any children. All customers must board and alight at the same stops when travelling using a Grouprider ticket.
Some tickets are available within set areas and boundaries. These are most commonly referred to as the “City Zone”, “Outer Zone” and “Easyrider” boundaries.
CITY ZONE DEFINITION: Easyrider, Cityrider, Grouprider tickets are valid on all services within the ‘City Zone. The ‘City Zone includes all NCT services over their complete route except on the following services, where they are valid between the points shown:
1 between Nottingham and Clifton Pastures
26, 26A, N26 between Nottingham and Carlton-le-Willows School/Linden Grove
61 between Nottingham and Spring Lane (Gedling Country Park)
NCT accepts valid Concessionary Travel Permits in accordance with the national scheme requirements and additional local enhancements where available. Please contact your council for details of available concessions.
NCT accepts Robin Hood Travel Cards in accordance with the advertised Robin Hood boundary and scheme rules.
Wheelchairs
All NCT buses meet the legal requirement to have a bay which can accommodate one ‘standard reference wheelchair’.
A ‘standard reference wheelchair’ has a maximum width of 700mm, a length of 1200mm, sitting height 1350mm, footrest 150mm from the floor. Electric wheelchairs are treated the same as other wheelchairs.
Class 2 Motorised scooters are permitted on buses when a valid CPT Mobility Scooter permit has been issued.
Our buses are designed to carry 1 wheelchair at a time and following a 2017 Supreme Court ruling, we have adopted a policy where priority to the bay should be given to a wheelchair user.
Where the bay is occupied by a non-wheelchair user, our drivers will ask people occupying the bay to relocate to another part of the bus to allow a wheelchair user to board. If the customer refuses to move, our drivers will ask a second time, pointing out that the space is designated for a wheelchair user.
Where a customer still refuses to move to allow a wheelchair user to board, the driver is unable to force them to move and will contact our Control Room to seek guidance on what action to take next. This is most likely to be contacting the next available bus to let the driver know you will be boarding, or in some cases, booking a taxi for you (at our expense) to make your journey. Due to limited availability of wheelchair compliant taxis, you may have to transfer from your wheelchair on to a seat in the taxi and your wheelchair be folded down to be carried.
One unfolded wheelchair can be accommodated per bus and:
On single decks and double decks purchased since 2013, the wheelchair must have full access to the bay and cannot share the bay with a pushchair. Often, a separate bay is available for a pushchair.
On double decks purchased before 2012, the wheelchair can travel in the same bay as up to 2 pushchairs.
The driver will lower the ramp for a wheelchair user to allow them access on and off the bus.
In a small number of cases, the driver is exempt from deploying the ramp on medical grounds because they have a disability. In these cases, a customer or a member of the Customer Liaison Team will assist.
Wheelchair users should get on and off the bus facing forwards.
The rear of the wheelchair must be placed against the back rest and the arm (where fitted) must be placed in position. Wheelchairs must not cause any obstruction to the gangway.
The brake must be applied when parked in the bay.
Wheelchair users must remain in their wheelchair throughout the journey and if they transfer to a seat, the wheelchair must be suitably stored.
Pushchairs
Following a 2017 Supreme Court ruling, we have adopted a policy where priority to the bay should be given to a wheelchair user.
Unfolded pushchairs, which are occupied by a child, can be carried on our buses, when the bay is not required by a wheelchair user, up to the maximum number shown on the bus.
Where a customer with a pushchair is trying to board a bus and the bay is full, the driver will give the parent or guardian the opportunity to collapse the pushchair and store it in the luggage rack.
Where a customer with a pushchair is already on the bus and a wheelchair user wishes to board, the customer with the pushchair should be prepared to collapse their pushchair, if requested by the driver, to allow a wheelchair user on board.
Double and triple buggies are determined based on their overall width, for example: a “double buggy” where two children are side by side is classed as 2 pushchairs. A “double” buggy where one child is above the other child is classed as 1 pushchair.
If a customer is unable to collapse a pushchair or relocate to another part of the bus, the driver can issue you with a complimentary ticket to allow you to board the next bus.
When a pushchair is occupying the space, the child must be left in the pushchair and the pushchair suitably loaded (but not overloaded) with bags.
Pushchairs must not be left unattended. The parent/guardian must either sit or stand with the pushchair.
The pushchair’s brakes must be applied, at all times when it is parked within the bay.
Parents/guardians have a responsibility to ensure that the gangway is not obstructed by any part of the pushchair.
Behaviour On the Bus - Your Responsibilities as A Passenger
In order to ensure that your bus journey and that of other passengers is safe and comfortable, we ask you to note the following.
All passengers are carried on our services subject to the Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations.
When on the bus, you must not:
Smoke or vape
Eat fast or smelly food
Bring on hot drinks without a secure lid
Drink alcohol
Damage or deface any part of the bus
Use any loud music system or instrument
Spit
Offend the driver or fellow passengers
Put at risk or cause discomfort to other passengers, the driver or any member of NCT staff
Act in a violent or abusive manner
Obstruct the gangway
Throw items from the bus
Lean out of the windows
Leave litter on the bus
Speak to or distract the driver when the bus is in motion except in emergency situations
Intentionally interfere with any equipment fitted to the bus
Alter or deface your ticket
Engage in any criminal activity
In the interests of health and safety, you must always follow instructions either given by signage on the bus or by any member of our staff, agents and or subcontractors.
Emergency doors and windows must only be used in the event of an emergency or when directed by the driver or an inspector.
Passengers or members of the public must not, without written permission from the Company, distribute or leave any materials or sell any articles on the bus.
Any passenger who is reasonably suspected by the driver or inspector of contravening the Public Services Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers Regulations shall give their name and address to the driver or inspector on demand. They may also be asked to leave or be removed from the vehicle by the driver or any member of our staff, agents and/or subcontractors.
Our staff have the right to work without fear of intimidation, verbal abuse or physical assault. We will support prosecutions against any passengers who abuse or assault our employees or damage our vehicles or property and reserve the right to ban them from using Nottingham City Transport services (see below).
Seated and Standing Passengers
The maximum capacity of each bus is displayed on the lower deck, near the entrance doors, and must not be exceeded.
Standing is available on all of our buses and the number of standees displayed is on the basis that every seat is occupied. Where passengers choose to stand when there are still seats available, the number of people standing can exceed the displayed number, provided the total number of people on the bus does not exceed the overall maximum capacity referred to in point 94. We would encourage passengers to always take a seat, when available, as standing may deprive others of the chance to board, as gangways may be obstructed.
Standing is not permitted on the stairs, in the door well or on the upper deck of double deck buses. When standing, please make use of the handrails, seat backs and supports fitted.
With the exception of seats labelled as "Priority Seats", all seats on the bus are available on a first come, first served basis only. Customers who travel in priority marked seats should be prepared to move to other seats on the bus, if the priority seat is required by someone less mobile. Remember, not all disabilities and conditions are visible.
Getting Off the Bus
When you wish to get off the bus, please ring the bell once to let the driver know you want to alight.
For your comfort and safety, please give the driver sufficient time to be able to slow down properly for your stop.
Do not stand too close to the doors or on the red floor when waiting to alight.
You should alight through the front doors only.
You must not alight when the vehicle is still in motion.
CCTV and Data Protection
Customers are carried in accordance with our Customer Privacy Policy,
available here.
CCTV is in use on our buses.  CCTV can record images and sound for your safety, crime prevention, for insurance purposes and to ensure that our company policies and procedures are complied with.  CCTV data may be passed to the police to aid investigation of crime and or be used as evidence in criminal or civil proceedings.  CCTV footage is processed by us in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation.
We will take all reasonable precautions to keep your personal details secure, but unless we are negligent, we will not be liable for unauthorised access to information supplied by you to us.
Animals
Small pets are carried at the sole discretion of the bus driver. Dogs are charged at £1 per day, except assistance and guide dogs which are carried free and must be kept on a lead. Dogs that are legally required to be muzzled, must be muzzled.
No animal may be placed on a seat, and customers who do so will be asked to leave the bus.
You must comply with applicable legislation in relation to any pets travelling with you. The responsibility for keeping an animal under control rests entirely with the owner and any passenger must immediately comply with any request from an NCT employee, agents or subcontractors to leave the vehicle if the animal they are responsible for is causing upset or distress to other passengers.
Luggage and Lost Property
The driver has the right to refuse any item of property being brought on to the bus which they consider is unsuitable for carriage. This includes any item that they believe will cause offence or injury to other passengers or staff; cause damage to the bus or being of an excessive size. The following specific items cannot be carried:
Explosive, hazardous or combustible materials
Uncovered hot drinks or other similar liquids
Paint that is not being carried in a bag
Sheets of glass and mirrors
Televisions or electrical equipment that is not contained in its box
Non-folding bicycles (although small children’s bikes / scooters that can fit in the luggage rack can be carried)
E-scooters
Luggage must be safely stored away to not cause an obstruction to the main gangway or any emergency exit.
The responsibility for any item of property on the bus rests with the owner.
In the event of losing an item of property on one our buses, please contact us on
0115 950 60 70
, where we will be happy to check if an item has been handed in.
Any passenger who finds an item of lost property on the bus has an obligation to hand it to the bus driver. Removing items from the bus can be reported to the Police as ‘theft by finding’.
Our drivers will, where practicable, check the bus for lost property at each terminal stop.
All items of lost property handed-in are saved for 21 days and then disposed of, except perishable items which are disposed of immediately. Any disposal of ‘lost property’ in accordance with this clause shall be without any liability whatsoever to you.
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to open, examine and or destroy any items of lost property.
When collecting any item of lost property, contact details must be provided. Proof of identity will be required.
Compensation
Any claim for compensation for any additional travel costs incurred by you as a result of our service is considered on a case by case basis and the final decision will be made at our sole discretion. Where additional costs have been incurred, receipts and supporting evidence should be provided to us.
Travel Bans and Restrictions to Travel
We reserve the right to ban passengers, without notice, from Nottingham City Transport services, who abuse, intimidate or assault our employees, other customers or damage our vehicles or property.
This can take the form of a travel ban from all NCT services or a restriction on not being able to board the services of a particular driver or drivers.
A travel ban from all NCT services will be implemented based on incidents raised by employees or customers, which are supported and confirmed by CCTV and audio footage; a charge being made or a conviction.
The length of the travel ban will be dependent upon the severity of the incident. This will be for a minimum period of 3 months for verbal abuse and 6 months for a physical assault.
A restriction on travelling on the services of a specific driver or drivers is normally indefinite.
Travel bans will be reviewed upon receipt of a request from the banned passenger. The Company will consider removing a ban and in cases where it is considers a ban could be removed, it will only do so if the banned passenger signs an agreement to behave appropriately and within the requirements of our Terms and Conditions of Carriage.
In the event that a passenger breaches this agreement, a permanent travel ban will be implemented, with no further review available.
