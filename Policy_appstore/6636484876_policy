Effective Date: 22/02/2025
our privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the
information that you provide when using our app (the "App"). We are committed to safeguarding
your data while enhancing your trading experience with Chart AI.
1. Information Collection and Use
Chart AI collects and stores limited user information to provide and improve our services.
Specifically, we collect the following data:
Account Information: When you create a login for the App, we collect your email address and
any other information you provide during registration (e.g., username). This data is used to
authenticate your identity, enable account access, and manage your account.
Trading Preferences: We collect your trading preferences (e.g., Analysis Complexity, Trading
Preference, Language) to personalize and optimize the trading insights and analyses generated
by the App. This data helps us tailor recommendations to your needs.
Uploaded Charts and Analyses: Any trading charts you upload and the analyses generated within
the App are processed using OpenAI servers for analysis purposes and are stored locally on your
device. We do not retain or store chart data or analyses on our servers unless explicitly saved by
you through your account.
We use this information to:
Provide, maintain, and improve the App’s functionality, including personalized trading insights.
Communicate with you about your account or App updates (e.g., confirming login, notifying of
policy changes).
Ensure the security and integrity of your account and data.
2. Data Storage
Your account information (e.g., email, username) and trading preferences are stored securely in
Firebase, a third-party cloud service provider. Firebase ensures data encryption both in transit and
at rest to protect your information. Uploaded charts and analyses, unless saved via your account,
remain stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to or stored on external servers
beyond the temporary use of OpenAI servers for analysis. We do not retain chart or analysis data
unless you choose to save it through your account, in which case it is securely stored in Firebase.
3. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal data with third parties, except as described
below:
Firebase: Your account information and trading preferences are stored in Firebase for account
management and personalization. Firebase’s privacy practices are governed by their own
policies, which you can review at [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy].
OpenAI: Chart and analysis data are temporarily processed by OpenAI for generating trading
insights. OpenAI does not retain this data beyond the completion of the analysis. You can review
OpenAI’s privacy policy for further information on how they handle data:
[https://openai.com/en-GB/policies/row-privacy-policy/].
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required by law, regulation, or legal
process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Chart AI, our users, or the public.
4. Third-Party Services
The App uses OpenAI’s API for analyzing trading charts you upload and Firebase for storing account
information and trading preferences. While these third-party services process the information you
provide, their retention and handling of data are governed by their respective privacy policies,
linked above. We do not control or assume responsibility for their practices, but we select trusted
partners to ensure your data’s security.
5. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored on your device and in Firebase,
including encryption and secure access controls. However, we cannot guarantee the absolute
security of your data, as no system can be 100% secure. It is important for you to take precautions
to protect your device and account (e.g., using strong passwords, enabling two-factor
authentication) from unauthorized access.
6. Your Choices
Account Management: You can update or modify your account information and trading
preferences at any time through the App’s settings. However, you cannot currently delete your
account directly through the App. If you wish to delete your account and associated data, you
may request account deletion by contacting us (see Contact Us below), and we will remove your
data from Firebase within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal retention requirements.
Data Retention: You can choose not to save uploaded charts or analyses, in which case they will
remain only on your device. Saved data will be retained in Firebase unless you request data
removal.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the “Effective
Date” at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed
about how we are protecting your data.
