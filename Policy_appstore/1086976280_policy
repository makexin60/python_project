10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND
I used a different service for testing before and this was so much smoother and better! Very professional and friendly, they also helped me quickly when I accidentally deleted an appointment. 10/10 would recommend!
V. Cristy
SUPER IMPRESSED
The test taking was extremely easy. The proctor and customer service (which I had to call because of a mistake that I made) were both very friendly and efficient. And despite the hiccup my issue was resolved by customer service in less than 5 mins and the overall test taking was done within 10 mins. Super impressed!!
S. Ghosh

We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for AZOVA or our advertising partners that are more relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by AZOVA. We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. If your browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads, we will comply with your request. You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from us at any time by emailing us at support@azovahealth.com. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative websites (aboutads.info and www.networkadvertising.org). Please note that if you choose to opt out, you will continue to see ads on our Sites, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop.
We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information visitors submit through our Application, except as described in this privacy policy. We may share your information among AZOVA Inc. related entities for the purposes described in this privacy policy. We also may share the information with our marketing and advertising partners, who may communicate with you about other services, events and topics.
Additionally, we may share your information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf (e.g., laboratories, prescription drug providers, and other clinically relevant companies), that help us process orders, and fulfil and deliver products and services that you purchase from or through us. We may use third parties to help host our Application, send out email updates about the Application, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.
In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process, such as under the Health Insurance Portability Act (“HIPAA”) (for example, we may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation), (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information you have provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy.
As a Business Associate of health care providers that are Covered Entities under the federal healthcare privacy and security rules (HIPAA and HITECH), we maintain your Personal Health Information (PHI) in compliance with these rules and our contractual obligations with health care providers. We share information with health care providers who provide services to individuals, and they share information with us, for purposes related to treatment, payment and health care operations, and otherwise as agreed or authorized by you. Currently our main focus is providing a platform to allow individuals to receive telehealth Services from various healthcare providers and to serve as a platform upon which various healthcare providers can administer telemedicine services to patients. We collect your personal information solely for the purposes of providing the Services, marketing and promoting our Services to you, and for market research data. By agreeing to our Terms of Use and using our services you are consenting to the use of your personal data in this manner. We also give you the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving direct marketing or market research information by emailing us at privacy@azova.com. If we use PHI for direct marketing or market research purposes, we will ask you for your authorization.
Occasionally we provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites operate independently from our Application and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices or terms of use, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of the linked sites.
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards for the Application designed to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personal information we collect through our Application. However, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure. We maintain a high level of data protection via safeguards such as data backup, audit controls, access controls, and some data encryption. We use account information in a password-protected environment as a security measure to protect your data. Our Application and Services use industry standard SSL encryption to enhance the security of electronic data transmissions.
In addition, we urge you to take precautionary measures in maintaining the integrity of your data. Please be responsible in making sure no one can see or has access to your personal account and login/password information. If you use a public computer, e.g., at a library or a university, always remember to logout of the Application. If you use our Application or Services through your employer’s computer network or through a potentially non-secure internet connection, such use is at your own risk. We are not responsible for your handling, sharing, re-sharing and/or distribution of your personal or personal health information.
Our Application may link to or refer to websites or mobile device applications that we do not control. Any Personal Information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to this third party and is subject to this third party’s provider’s privacy policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such other websites or applications, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any website or application not controlled by us. If you have any concerns, we urge you to review the terms of those other websites or applications for more information about their applicable policies.
We will keep your personal information for the time period necessary to achieve the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, taking into account applicable statute of limitation periods and records retention requirements under applicable law.
Subject to applicable law, you have the right to request access to and rectification of the personal information we maintain about you, to request the restriction of the processing of your personal information, or to object to that processing on grounds relating to your particular situation. In addition, you may have the right to request erasure of your personal information in certain circumstances provided by applicable law. Subject to applicable law, where technically feasible, upon written request and verifiable identification, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
To exercise these rights, please contact us as indicated below. Depending upon where you are located, for example in the European Union, you may lodge a complaint with a data protection authority if you are not satisfied with our response. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to deal with your concerns before you approach a data protection authority, so please contact us in the first instance.
You can close your online patient account by sending an e-mail message to request account closure to cancel@azovahealth.com. You will no longer have access to any of the information on your AZOVA account. AZOVA will not be able to restore access to this account in any way. Any person or provider with whom you have communicated or shared information via your AZOVA account or with whom you have had an appointment on AZOVA will continue to have access to your records, communication and data. If you would like to request that the information you have shared with any healthcare professional be deleted, you must contact that healthcare professional directly and make the request.
Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar. To obtain this information, please email us with “Request for California Privacy Information” on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your email address in response. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
We may update or change this privacy policy from time to time and without prior notice to you. We will post a prominent notice on this web page to notify you of any significant changes to our privacy policy, or we may send them to you via email where we deem appropriate, and indicate at the top of this policy when it was most recently updated. You will always have the ability to stop using the service as explained above.
We value your privacy and your rights as a data subject and have therefore appointed Prighter as our privacy representative and your point of contact. Prighter gives you an easy way to exercise your privacy-related rights (e.g. requests to access or erase personal data).

We will say “yes” to all reasonable requests.
Ask us to limit what we use or share
You can ask us not to use or share certain health information for treatment, payment, or our operations. We are not required to agree to your request, and we may say “no” if it would affect your care.

FOR VIRGINIA RESIDENTS
We are happy to maintain your records while you are an active patient or to transfer your records to another practitioner or health care provider should you wish to seek care elsewhere. We consider patients inactive if they either ask to have their records transferred or they have not been seen in any of our offices for six years. Our policy is to destroy inactive medical records in accordance with the Virginia Department of Health Professions regulations.
These regulations (18VAC85-20-26) state that practitioners must maintain a patient record for a minimum of six years following the last patient encounter with the following exceptions:
1. Records of a minor child, including immunizations, must be maintained until the child reaches the age of 18 or becomes emancipated, with a minimum time for record retention of six years from the last patient encounter regardless of the age of the child;
2. Records that have previously been transferred to another practitioner or health care provider or provided to the patient or his personal representative; or
3. Records that are required by contractual obligation or federal law to be maintained for a longer period of time.
Practitioners must post information or in some manner inform all patients concerning the time frame for record retention and destruction. Patient records can only be destroyed in a manner that protects patient confidentiality, such as by incineration or shredding. For more information from the Virginia Department of Health Professions, go to www.dhp.virginia.gov/Medicine.
