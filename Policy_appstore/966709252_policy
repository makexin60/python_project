Privacy Policy
Updated and Effective From: March 28, 2023
Association of Surfing Professionals LLC d/b/a World Surf League, its subsidiaries and affiliates and WSL PURE (collectively, “WSL”, “we”, “our” or “us”) understand that your privacy is important to you. This Privacy Policy sets out what data WSL collects from you, including through its online and mobile sites and applications on which it is posted, including www.worldsurfleague.com and our membership management system at wsl.memberpro.net (each, a “WSL Digital Site” and, collectively, the “WSL Digital Sites”) and about you from other sources (for example, at an event or from WSL sponsors or other third parties), and how it is managed, shared or used by or on behalf of WSL. It also explains certain of your rights in respect of your personal data. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected from or about our employees in the context of their employment. If you are an athlete or other individual with an agreement with WSL, this Privacy Policy applies to that relationship except to the extent our practices may differ from this Privacy Policy as explained in any other agreements or consents you sign with us.
Here are a few general principles to keep in mind as you read through this Privacy Policy:
If you are located outside of the United States, you should know that the information you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and will be protected subject to this Privacy Policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country. Also, the WSL Digital Sites place cookies and local shared objects on your computer or device which are further described below.
Advertisements displayed to you on the WSL Digital Sites and elsewhere may be customized to your interests and preferences based on your Personal Data (defined below) collected through the WSL Digital Sites unless you opt out by following the instructions on the
NAI Opt-Out Page
, the
Ad Choices Opt-Out Page
, the
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada Opt-Out Page
, and
Your Online Choices from the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
. (You may have to opt out using each of your web browsing applications and devices separately.) However, if you opt out, we may still suggest offerings to you on the WSL Digital Sites based on your history at the WSL Digital Sites.
As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Data” includes information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you, as well as information attributed with such information.
You may have the right to opt in or to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Data as described below, including in the Opt-Out Rights section.
1. Access by Children
Except as specifically provided in the Notice to Parents section below, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any WSL Digital Sites or areas of any WSL Digital Sites that are directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly solicit, obtain, retain or use any personal information collected from children under the age of 13 years through the WSL Digital Sites in a manner that is inconsistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Accordingly, children under the age of 13 may be restricted from participating in certain features on the WSL Digital Sites. If WSL is made aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13 years of age in a manner that is inconsistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, WSL will delete this information as soon as possible. For more details on WSL’s policy with respect to children, please see our Notice to Parents section below and our
terms of use
.

We collect different categories of information about you (including Personal Data) from different sources, including information you provide and usage information about your visits to the WSL Digital Sites.

Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on page
and install the add-on for your browser.
c. Geo-location information
By accessing the WSL Digital Sites from a mobile phone, through a mobile application or another GPS-equipped device, you may be asked to share your precise (GPS level) geo-location information with us. This enables us, among other things, to customize your experience on the WSL Digital Sites or on other sites when we work with a third-party mobile ad platform. In most cases, you are able to turn off precise geo-location data collection through your device at any time through the privacy settings on your device or through the settings in the applicable mobile application.
d. Cookies and Tagging Technology
In common with other website operators, we may deploy, including through our service providers and third party advertising partners, technology called “cookies” and other tracking technologies on the WSL Digital Sites to collect additional information about your visits to the WSL Digital Sites, in order to, among other things, personalize your experience, administer the WSL Digital Sites, analyze trends and user data and gather demographic information. For further details on how we use cookies, and your choices regarding cookies, please refer to the WSL Cookies Policy which you can
read here
. In addition to cookies, these tracking technologies may include the following:
A pixel tag (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a website page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of the WSL Digital Sites.
HTML5 (the language some websites are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your WSL Digital Site usage activities. This information can be retrieved by us to determine how the WSL Digital Sites are being used by our visitors, how they can be improved, and to customize them for our users.
These technologies enable us to assign a unique number or persistent identifier to you, your household or device and relate information about your usage of WSL Digital Sites to other information about you, including your Personal Data. These technologies also enable us to recognize you when you access the WSL Digital Sites using different web browsers and different computers or devices.

4. Sharing of Information
We may share the information (including Personal Data) we collect from or about you with others for a variety of reasons. In addition to the kinds of information sharing you might expect, such as sharing what you voluntarily post to public areas on the WSL Digital Sites with other users of the WSL Digital Sites, we may share your information (including any of the types listed above), or allow your information to be collected by third parties on the WSL Digital Sites, in the following circumstances:

We gather statistics around email opening and clicks to help us monitor and improve our e-mail campaigns and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For more information, please see
MailChimp’s privacy notice
. You can unsubscribe from receiving e-mails from us by changing your preferences in the profile section of your account or by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails.

When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of WSL or others, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request, or to comply with the law.
In connection with a corporate change or dissolution, including for example a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, sale of assets or wind down of business.
WSL is responsible only for the content on the WSL Digital Sites and for the use of your Personal Data by WSL. All third parties associated with a WSL Digital Site or with whom WSL may share Personal Data are bound by their own privacy and data collection and protection practices. WSL cannot be held liable for the policies or actions of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policy of any click-thru site they visit through a WSL Digital Site.
5. Opt-Out Rights
You may have the right to opt in or to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Data. For example, when you are asked to provide Personal Data on the WSL Digital Sites, you may have the opportunity to elect to, or not to, receive certain messages from us by email. You may opt out of receiving our promotional messages by clicking on an opt-out link within the email you receive or revising your preferences on the "profile" section of your account on the WSL Digital Sites. You may opt out of our sharing your information in the future with third parties for their own business purposes (including their marketing purposes) by emailing us at
support@worldsurfleague.com
and describing your request in reasonable detail.
Please understand that it may take us several days to process any opt-out request and that even if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us or opt out of our sharing with third parties for their own purposes, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us and we may still share your information with third parties to perform services on our behalf.
6. Accuracy, Completeness and Deletion Requests
We encourage you to ensure that your Personal Data in your account is kept accurate and up to date. If you have a membership or account with us and any of the Personal Data in your account is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact WSL immediately using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy. You may also be able to access and correct certain of the information in your account by logging into your account and making the necessary edits. We may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information.
If you are a California resident or are located in the European Union or a similar jurisdiction, you may have certain additional access or deletion rights as described in the applicable jurisdiction-specific section below.
Your rights to access or delete your information are subject to our records retention policies and applicable law.
7. Other people's information which you provide to WSL
If you provide Personal Data to WSL about someone else, such as your child, agent or next of kin, you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose such information to WSL and allow WSL to collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described above without being required to do anything else under relevant privacy laws (which may include laws of a country they are from or in which they reside). You should take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the contents of this Privacy Policy as those matters relate to them. You warrant that any information you disclose is true and correct.
8. Security
While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Data collected via the WSL Digital Sites, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
If you correspond with us by email, text message, or using web forms like a “contact us” feature on the WSL Digital Sites, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view the information you send in transit by such means. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
Your account on a WSL Digital Site is password-protected, and you should not divulge your passwords to anyone. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your member name, password and other account information, and you shall be responsible for any activity that occurs using your account credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. Any information posted or disclosed on a message board or comment section may be viewed and used by other members of the public. If you post any Personal Data in a publicly accessible area of a WSL Digital Site, you do so at your own risk and WSL accepts no liability for the same.
9. Online and Mobile Advertising: Opting Out
We use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the WSL Digital Sites and other online properties. These companies may use information about your visits to the WSL Digital Sites and other online properties over time, the region of the country or world where your IP address indicates you are located, and other information about you in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies, clear GIFs and other tracking technologies to cause relevant ads to be displayed to you. We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy policies to learn about how they treat your information.
For example, Facebook is an advertising partner and may collect and use data about your online activities to display advertisements on WSL Digital Sites or elsewhere. For more information and to control the Facebook ads you see, visit
https://m.facebook.com/ads/audience_network
.
**If you wish to know more about interest-based advertising, would like to know more about your options or would like to opt-out, you can visit the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”). NAI is a co-operative of online advertising companies who are committed to responsible practices and consumer protection. You may also visit the
Digital Advertising Alliance
for more information about what you can do if you do not want to receive interest-based advertising.
**European users can opt out from interest-based advertising through the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
; and users in Canada can opt out using the
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
site.
To opt out of interest-based advertising, you may have to opt out using each of your web browsing applications and devices separately. If you opt out, we may still suggest offerings to you on the WSL Digital Sites based on your history at the WSL Digital Sites.
Browser and mobile operating systems also provide other privacy and ad-blocking mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” (DNT) signals to the websites with which the user communicates. We encourage you to review the privacy control settings available in your browser or device platforms settings. Note that some of these controls (such as blocking third-party cookies) may affect the storage of your opt-out preferences. To express your privacy preferences for certain companies you may download and use an opt-out application such as
DAA's AppChoices App
.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate do-not-track  signals, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Certain third parties, such as web analytics companies and third-party ad networks, collect information about your online activities over time and across the WSL Digital Sites and other online properties. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to do-not-track settings in your web browser and we may not obligate these parties to do so.
You can stop all future collection of information by a WSL mobile app on your mobile device by uninstalling that WSL mobile app. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. Most operating systems such as iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices also provide their own instructions on how to prevent delivery of tailored advertising to your mobile device. Please also review your mobile device’s privacy settings and support materials if you wish to opt out of tailored advertisements.
10. Social Networking
We use several social networking platforms to communicate with you, some of which are operated by third parties, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, YouTube and others. This Privacy Policy does not apply to what those third-party platforms do with your information. Those platforms have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to read them.
You may use third-party social networking services to share information about your experience on the WSL Digital Sites with your friends and followers on those social networking services. These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the WSL Digital Sites. These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on the WSL Digital Sites and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of the WSL Digital Sites or about your use of the WSL Digital Sites, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services. Your interactions with those social networking services are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant service.
The WSL Digital Sites may include features and functionalities that allow you to share information with us that you have already provided to a third-party social networking platform. For example, you may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Instagram) to your account on the WSL Digital Sites. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on the WSL Digital Sites. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, then Personal Data or other data you have provided to that third party will be made available to us, pursuant to the third party’s terms and conditions, and you consent to our use of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The information we receive from that third party may depend on the privacy settings you have on the third-party service.
11. Links to other Websites
The WSL Digital Sites may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under WSL’s control or maintained by WSL. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by WSL of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith, and we are not responsible for such other websites, content, persons or entities. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third-party websites or services visited after leaving the WSL Digital Sites to learn about how your information is treated by others.
12. California Privacy Rights
If you are a California Resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding your personal information. To learn more about your California privacy rights, visit our
Privacy Notice for California Residents
.
13. Privacy Rights under European Law and Similar Jurisdictions
If you are a natural person located in the European Union or a jurisdiction with substantially similar privacy laws (such as the United Kingdom) when we collect your Personal Data (a “
Data Subject
”), you have certain rights in addition to those described elsewhere in this policy. This section of the Privacy Policy only applies to Data Subjects.
These rights are in relation to Data Subjects’ Personal Data and include the right to be informed about the collection and use of Data Subjects’ Personal Data, as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Such rights of a Data Subject also include, where certain conditions are met:
the right to request access to the Personal Data we hold about such Data Subject,
the right to have inaccurate information about such Data Subject amended or updated,
the right to object to processing of Personal Data about such Data Subject,
the right to withdraw consent at any time (where relevant),
the right to have Personal Data about such Data Subject erased or to restrict processing in certain limited situations,
the right to data portability and to request the transmission of Personal Data about such Data Subject to another organization,
the right to object to automated decision making that materially impacts such Data Subject, direct marketing, and processing for research or statistical purposes, and
the right to lodge complaints with applicable data supervisory authorities, in particular in the EU Member State or related jurisdiction of such Data Subject’s habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of applicable law.
a. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We use the Personal Data of Data Subjects where there is an appropriate lawful basis. Typically this means we will only process such Personal Data where it is necessary (i) for us to perform a contract with such Data Subject or in order to take preparatory steps to enter into a contract, (ii) for compliance with a legal and/or regulatory obligation, or (iii) for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (including legal, investigatory, personnel, administrative and management purposes) and this does not override such Data Subject’s rights and freedoms.
In rare cases, we may process Personal Data of Data Subjects: (i) for the protection of their interests (or someone else’s interests) or (ii) where it is needed in the public interest. We will only process “special category personal data” where a further condition is also met.
b. Disclosure & Retention of Data Subjects’ Personal Data
We will take reasonably necessary steps to ensure that where Personal Data of Data Subjects is shared with third parties, it is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
WSL will endeavor not to keep Personal Data of Data Subjects in a form that allows you to be identified for any longer than is reasonably necessary for achieving the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will endeavor not to keep Personal Data in a form that allows a Data Subject to be identified for any longer than is reasonably necessary for achieving the permitted purposes. At the end of the applicable retention period, we may destroy, erase from our systems, or anonymize such Personal Data as part of such efforts. To determine the appropriate retention period for such Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of such Personal Data, the purposes for which we process such Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We reserve the right to keep certain information in our archives that we deem necessary to comply with any legal obligations we may have, resolve disputes and enforce contractual agreements. Our Data Retention & Disposal Policy is available upon request.
c. Storage & Transfer of Data Subjects’ Personal Data
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect Data Subjects’ Personal Data, prevent unlawful or unauthorized processing of personal information, and prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or accidental loss of, or damage to, such information. We restrict access to non-public Personal Data about Data Subjects to those of our employees and agents who need to know the information to enable us to provide services.
We may process personal information in, and transfer Personal Data to, countries that may not guarantee the same level of protection for Personal Data as the country in which Data Subjects reside. Personal Data will also be processed by staff who work for us and operate outside country where Data Subjects reside. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the provision of administration and support services. All such staff are subject to appropriate confidentiality and security obligations.
We will only transfer Personal Data of Data Subjects to third party service providers if they agree to comply with the physical, electronic and procedural safeguards described above, or if they put in place adequate measures themselves.
d. Data Subject Access Rights
In many cases, Data Subjects can manage their account information, make changes to the information that they have provided WSL or delete their account in the preferences section of the website. If Data Subjects want further details about their personal information held by WSL and how it is used, please make a request using this Request Form.
14. Notice to Parents
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “
COPPA
”) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this Notice to Parents, “parents”) about our practices for collecting personal information from children under the age of 13 in the United States (“
children
”) online and how we use and disclose that information. It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information. This Notice to Parents is issued by us to notify parents of, among other things:
The types of information we may collect from children online.
How we use that information.
Our practices for disclosing that information.
Certain rights of parents pertaining to personal information of their children.
The operators that collect or maintain information from children through the WSL Digital Sites.
This Notice to Parents only applies to children under the age of 13 in the United States and supplements our Privacy Policy.
Any terms that are defined in COPPA have the same meanings when used in this Notice to Parents (even if defined differently for the rest of our Privacy Policy).
Information We Collect Online from Children
Children can access many parts of the WSL Digital Sites and its content and use many of its features without providing us with personal information. However, some opportunities, content and features are available only to registered users or registered WSL members or require us to collect certain information, including personal information, from them. In addition, we use certain technologies, such as cookies, to automatically collect information from our users (including children) when they visit or use the WSL Digital Sites.
We do not condition a child’s participation in an activity on disclosing more personal information to us than is reasonably necessary for the relevant activity.
Information We Collect Directly from Children
A child (or the parent on the child’s behalf) must provide us with the following information:
To register for a general public account on the WSL Digital Sites: name and email address.
To register as a WSL member at wsl.memberpro.net: name, email address, gender, date of birth, birth country, address, phone number, nation represented and parent name and contact information.  Payment information is also collected from parents in order to process registrations for memberships, events and insurance.
Registration also requires a member name or number and password. We may request additional information from your child that is optional. We indicate whether information is required or optional when we request it.
We may enable users to communicate with others on or through the WSL Digital Sites through chat, email, other social features and posting to public areas of the WSL Digital Sites (“
Social Features
”). The nature of these features allows children to disclose personal information about themselves. We do not monitor or review this content before it is posted, and we do not control the actions of third parties with whom your child shares his or her information. We encourage parents to educate their children about safe internet use and to monitor their children’s use of Social Features.
Automatic Information Collection and Tracking
We use technology to automatically collect information from our users, including children, when they access and navigate through the WSL Digital Sites and use certain of its features. The information we collect through these technologies may include:
One or more persistent identifiers that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites and online services.
Information that identifies a device’s location (geolocation information).
We also may combine non-personal information we collect through these technologies with personal information about you or your child that we collect online.
For information about our automatic information collection practices, including how you can opt out of certain information collection, see the other sections of our Privacy Policy, particularly the sections titled “Information collected automatically when you visit a WSL Digital Site”, “Geo-location information”, “Cookies and Tagging Technology” and “Online and Mobile Advertising: Opting Out.”
How We Use Your Child’s Information
We use the personal information we collect from your child for the purposes described in the “Use of Information collected” section of our Privacy Policy above (but note that “you” in that section refers to your child).

Privacy Policy
.
Retention of Personal Information

In some circumstances, we may anonymize or deidentify your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may retain and use such data without further notice to you to the extent permitted by law.
Your Rights and Choices
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. The sections below describe your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights, which are subject to our records retention policies and applicable law (which has certain exceptions to these rights).
Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights
You have the right to request that we disclose the following information to you with respect to the preceding 12 months or a longer period as applicable under the CCPA:
The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources from which that personal information is collected.
The business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling or sharing that personal information.
The categories of third parties with which we disclose personal information.
The categories of your personal information which we disclosed for a business purpose and the categories of third parties to which we disclosed such personal information.
The categories of your personal information we have "sold" or “shared” and the categories of third parties to which we sold or shared such personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a "
data portability
" request).
Correction Request Rights
You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and purpose for which it is processed.  Once we receive and confirm the validity of your request, we will work to correct the requested personal information within our records as required by the CCPA.
Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete the personal information we collected about you, subject to certain exceptions provided by the CCPA. Once we receive and confirm the validity of your request, we will delete the requested personal information from our records or deidentify the information, unless an exception provided by the CCPA applies. For example, we may retain personal information as required or permitted by law, and may maintain a copy of your deletion request.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, Correction and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a valid consumer request to us by either:
Calling us toll-free at 1-866 – 980 -1358
Emailing us at support@worldsurfleague.com
Filling out the Web Form
here
.
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a valid consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a valid consumer request on behalf of your minor child. Depending on the nature of your request (for example, for requests to know, delete or correct personal information), you may be sent an email to verify and confirm your identity before we can comply with your request.
A valid consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. To verify your request, we work to match the personal information about you provided with the request with personal information in our records to determine whether and what personal information we hold about you that falls in scope of a valid CCPA request of that nature. We cannot carry out your request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  You may only make a valid consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Please describe your request with sufficient detail for us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.
Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
You have the right to opt out of our future "sale" or “sharing” of your personal information. To do so, you may submit a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" request by:
Following the instructions available
here
.
Calling us at 1-866 - 980 - 1358
You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights.
Please be aware, if you do not log in to your account (or do not have an account with us) and instead opt out of certain future “sales” or "sharing" of your personal information to our ad partners by setting a cookie-based "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" preference that is specific to the WSL Digital Site that you are visiting, such setting is also specific to the device and browser you are using. It will only work if your browser is set to accept cookies, and you will need to opt out on each device and each browser you use to visit a WSL Digital Site. Once the "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" cookie setting expires, or if you clear your browser cookies, you will need to reset the setting if you wish to opt out again. For our mobile apps, the local setting should remain until you specifically change it or clear the mobile app’s data on your device; however, you should check the setting regularly to ensure it reflects your current preferences.
We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization from the consumer who is at least 13, but not yet 16, years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt in to personal information sales may opt out of future sales at any time.
Requests from Authorized Agents
If you would like an authorized agent to submit a CCPA request on your behalf or if you are an authorized agent of a consumer and registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California, please submit the request using one of the methods offered as described in this Notice and provide, as part of the request, evidence that you have authority to act on the consumer’s behalf in this manner in the form of a written letter of authority or power of attorney.
Right of Non-Discrimination
You have a right under the CCPA not to receive discriminatory treatment by us because you exercised any of your CCPA rights.  Except when permitted by the CCPA, examples of discriminatory treatment include denying goods or services; charging different prices or rates for goods or services; providing a different level or quality of goods or services; suggesting any of the foregoing; and retaliating against an employee, applicant for employment, or independent contractor.  However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Financial Incentives Program
We offer various financial incentives. In order to participate in some of these financial incentives, you may be asked to provide personal information or allow us to sell or share that personal information with a third party. For example, you may have the opportunity to receive free or discounted tickets to events, merchandise, shipping or other products or services in exchange for our collection of your Identifiers, Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute, Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law, Commercial information, and Internet or other electronic network activity, signing up to receive our marketing communications or agreeing to sign up for an account with WSL or a third party with whom we have a relationship (such as Club Rip Curl).
Your participation in a financial incentive program is voluntary and you may withdraw from the program at any time.  To withdraw and forgo any ongoing incentive, you may unsubscribe from our emails (for email-based incentives only) or, for other incentives, submit a request to opt-out by emailing us at
support@worldsurfleague.com
with the subject line “Financial Incentive Opt-Out” and include the name of the applicable program(s) or promotion(s) you wish to discontinue as well as the email address and other information you submitted when signing up for the program.  To withdraw from a financial incentive program that involved sharing your personal information with a third party or creating an account with that third party (such as a referral program), you will need to directly contact any third party that already received your information directly and request to opt out and/or close your account with them, as relevant.
For each CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer, we have determined that the value of the financial incentive you would receive reasonably relates to your personal information’s value. To assess this, we estimate the value of consumers’ personal information by considering the expenses incurred by us related to the collection, storage and retention of consumers’ personal information in the context of the financial incentive program and the expenses related to the provision of the financial incentive. From time to time, we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive, which will be presented to you at the time you sign up for the financial incentive.
Reasonable Access for Consumers with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities may obtain this Notice in an alternative format upon request by contacting us at support@worldsurfleague.com or calling 1-866 – 980 -1358.
Changes to Our Privacy Notice
We reserve the right to amend this Notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this Notice, we will post the updated notice on the WSL Digital Sites and update the notice’s effective date. Your continued use of the WSL Digital Sites following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

Intuit Global Privacy Statement
Last Updated: September 8, 2024
See previous Privacy Statements
Expand All
Collapse All
Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role
Intuit responsibly leverages technology to power prosperity around the world. We believe that everyone has a right to privacy. As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (
“Privacy Statement”
) to explain how we, Intuit Inc. and the
Intuit group companies
(collectively
“Intuit,” “we,” “us,” or “our”
), collect, use, share, or otherwise process information that we collect through our services. These services include, as applicable, our websites, mobile applications, social media pages, marketing activities, and other activities described in this Privacy Statement, or when other businesses provide us your personal information (collectively, the
“Services”
). This Privacy Statement is global, meaning it applies to all Intuit Services. We may provide additional or supplemental privacy statements for certain products or services.
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices when we process:
Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “
Tax Preparation Information
”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;
Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of our websites and the Intuit platform, which includes all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) other than Tax Preparation Information (the “
Intuit Platform
”); and
Personal information as necessary to manage, run, improve, and develop our business and personalize your experience while interacting with the Intuit Platform. Depending on your settings, this may include showing you personalized ads or recommending certain Intuit products based on your interests.
Intuit determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement, and therefore acts as a ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms under applicable data privacy laws) of such information. We may share your personal information within the
Intuit group companies
and conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your personal information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities. This means we determine how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable data privacy laws. Intuit is not responsible for other data controllers’ processing activities, and you should contact them directly for questions about how they process your personal information and about how to exercise your privacy rights in relation to such processing.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to certain processing activities where we are not the controller. For example, where Intuit processes personal information as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, including when we process personal information on behalf of customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a processor or service provider, the privacy statement of the customer who uses our Services applies, instead of this Privacy Statement, and our processing of such personal information is governed by our agreements with such customers. If you have concerns about personal information that we process on behalf of a customer, or wish to exercise your privacy rights regarding such personal information, please contact the customer directly.
This Privacy Statement also does not apply to Intuit Financial Services or Intuit’s processing of education records subject to state or federal laws or children’s data in our education curriculum products. You may find the privacy statement for Intuit Financial Services
here
, and the privacy statement for Intuit for Education
here
.
If you have any questions about how Intuit processes your personal information, please see How to contact us below.
The Intuit platform
The Intuit Platform and your personal information
When we say “platform,” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), Intuit uses that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using. This means that, for example, we may use your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, contact and purchase history details from Mailchimp, and/or recommendations from Credit Karma. The personal information we use in this centralized way may relate to you as an end user of our Services or as a customer or vendor of an Intuit customer whose personal information has been included in the Intuit Platform.
Business account information
Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with a business (such as your employer). If you are granted access to a business account (for example, in QuickBooks), the business owner or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If the owner or designated administrator changes your access rights, then you may lose access to the information the business controls.
Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of a business account may be subject to the business’s policies, which may differ from this Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other businesses, and you should consider both the business’s policies and whether you are comfortable giving the business access to your personal information before connecting to their services.
Personal information we collect
The personal information that we collect or otherwise receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings. The way we process your personal information may also depend on the particular Services, functionalities, or experiences you use, your location, and applicable law.
Information you provide to us
You may provide us with your information as follows:
Contact data and account profile data.
We collect information when you (or your organization) create an account, activate a subscription, and/or upload information to the Intuit Platform. Personal information may include your name, previous name(s) and/or nicknames, title and honorifics, professional title and company name, education, billing and mailing addresses, phone number and email address, profile photo, billing information (your payment information), purchase history, demographic information, preferences, subscription data, and your username and account credentials.
Identity verification information.
We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, date of birth, social security number, social insurance number, driver’s license number, passport number, government-issued identification details, and similar information to verify your identity and to help you file your tax return.
Communications, feedback and survey data, and related data.
We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number and any other personal information you choose to share when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, attend our events, participate in product research or training, or otherwise interact or communicate with us. This information may include: call center recordings and call monitoring records, chat and text records, voicemails, photographs, and video images.
Marketing data.
You may provide us with your contact information and preferences for receiving marketing communications.
Social and community content.
We receive content you post on our social media pages and our community pages.
Business and financial information.
We may receive information about your business, your finances, expenses, invoices, financial statements, details of your financial transactions, payroll details, payment details, tax return details, details about your customers, vendors, or employees, income and wage information, and/or investment information.
Interactions with experts.
The Intuit Platform provides many opportunities for you to connect with live experts, including, for example, accountants or tax preparers. When you interact with these experts, we may receive information about the questions you ask, the details of your accounts, and the guidance provided to you.
Interactions with chatbots.
We may receive information from you through your use of chatbots, digital assistants, or other interactive bots across the Intuit Platform.
Device and contact data.
If you grant permission in your device settings, certain features may have access to your device and contacts.
Business connection data.
We may collect information about you when you interact with the Intuit Platform through our customers. If you are a customer, vendor or prospect of an Intuit customer and interact with the Intuit Platform (for example, to pay an invoice, make a purchase, interact with an email, provide contact details or complete a survey), we will use this information to make recommendations about you to our customers. Our customers may also provide business connection data directly about you to us; this is described below under ‘Other users’.
Third-party sources
The Intuit Platform is designed to help you connect with other people and businesses. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input personal information about you, including other customers using the Intuit Platform. For example, an Intuit customer may share personal information about you with us in order to use and benefit from the Intuit Platform. You also may be able to input or process personal information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator of one of our products or use Intuit to manage customer lists. If you input information about others into the Platform, you must only do so if you have first provided sufficient notice and received any required permissions, and have an appropriate legal basis if required by applicable law.
We may also receive personal information about you from other third parties where you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process the personal information obtained from those third parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our third-party sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform. For example, we receive information from:
Linked third-party services.
If you choose to sync a non-Intuit account/service with your Intuit account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. This may include details of your bank account information, social media information, purchase history or your business’s sales records through a point of sale application.
Supplemental information and identity verification providers.
We work with certain third parties to help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business, and/or supplement the personal information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your personal information. For example, we use third-party providers to validate your contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, phone number) or to provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial institution, telecommunications provider, or email provider.
Customer support providers.
We receive personal information about you or your interaction with the Intuit Platform from certain third parties for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain information about your interaction(s) with customer support and information about technical issues you have raised, including call center recordings, call monitoring records, voicemails, photographs and chat records.
Credit bureaus and related third parties.
Many Intuit features rely on information we receive from credit bureaus and related third parties. For example, in some countries, we may offer free credit reports and credit scores. We request these reports and credit scores on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. These partners may also provide personal information such as employment or income data, social security number, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so we can make more personalized recommendations for you.
Other users.
As described above, we may receive personal information about you from other Intuit Platform users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, spouse, employer, or other business customers using the Intuit Platform (e.g., businesses from which you buy products or services, or with which you otherwise interact). We may also collect such personal information through features like member referral programs.
Risk management, cybersecurity & anti-fraud providers.
We may receive personal information from third parties that help us assess risks associated with our offerings, including to help combat fraud and illegal activity and to help protect your personal information.
Data providers.
We may receive information from information services and data licensors that provide demographic and preference information to us.
Content providers.
We may receive personal information from companies that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.
Joint offering partners.
We may offer co-branded services or experiences or engage in joint-marketing activities with others, including through our conferences or live events.
Government agencies.
We receive information from government agencies, including from various tax agencies, such as your tax filing confirmation from the IRS.
Public information.
We collect individual and household demographic information and preference information from publicly available sources, such as open government databases, social media platforms, and others.
Automatic data collection
We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log personal information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, such as:
Device information.
We may collect information about your device(s) such as IP addresses, log information, error messages, device type, and unique device identifiers. For example, we may collect IP addresses from you as part of our sign in and security features.
Usage information.
We may collect information about your use of the Intuit Platform, such as the pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type, and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.
Location information.
Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you or your organization grant(s) us permission to do so through your device settings (for example, if you use QuickBooks’ time-tracking service, participate in Karma Drive, or use CK Money to locate nearby ATMs).
Information stored locally.
Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.
Communication interaction data.
We or our third-party service providers may collect information from email providers, communication providers and social networks, such as your interactions with our email, text or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) – we may do this through use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails.
Online behavioral data
. We may automatically collect certain personal information about your use and interactions with our websites, customers’ websites or e-commerce stores, social media websites, and marketing campaigns that we or our customers organize, including device information (such as your IP address and unique device IDs), page view information and search results, links, and if you are a customer contact, whether or not a campaign presented or sent to you using our offerings has been viewed, delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it has bounced or was treated as spam.
Cookies and similar technologies
Intuit and our service providers may use commonly used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects and similar technologies (collectively “cookies”) to collect information about you (“
Cookie Information
”) so we can provide the experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers’ experiences. For example, we may use session-replay technologies,
such as those provided by FullStory and Medallia, that employ software code to record users’ interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch video replays of those user sessions. The replays include users’ clicks, mobile app touches, mouse movements, scrolls and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. You can learn more about FullStory at
https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy
and you can opt-out of session recording by FullStory at
https://www.fullstory.com/optout/

Other circumstances.
We also share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances.
For research.
With appropriate controls, we may share information with third parties, such as academic institutions, government and non-profit organizations, for research purposes or to publish academic or policy-related materials. We only share information in a way that does not identify any individual.
With financial services providers.
In connection with our financial products, we may share personal information with collection agencies, credit bureaus and loan services providers, and payment card association members. We may also share your personal information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents, government agencies, and card associations in connection with issues related to fraud, credit, defaults, or debt collection.

See also the “Region and state-specific terms” section below for additional information.
Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) responds to the Global Privacy Control signal for US residents, as described further in the United States section below. However, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals because there is no formal “Do Not Track” standard.
For legal reasons.
We may share your personal information with third parties for legal reasons without your consent, and as permitted by law, including:
When we reasonably believe disclosure is required in order to comply with a subpoena, court order, or other applicable law, regulation or legal process;

Your Rights
Depending on where you live, you may also have certain state- or country-specific rights with respect to your personal information. Please see the Region and state-specific terms section for your country, below.
Verification
To help protect privacy and the security of your personal information, you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity and/or ownership rights before we can fulfill your data rights request. If we cannot verify your identity or your ownership rights to the data, we may not be able to service your request until you provide proper documentation.
Data retention
Unless you specifically ask us to delete your personal information, we retain your personal information as long as it is necessary to comply with our data retention requirements and provide you with services and the benefits of the Intuit Platform and successfully run our business. Even if you submit a deletion request, we may be required to maintain your personal information for as long as necessary to:
comply with our legal or regulatory compliance needs (e.g., maintaining records of transactions you have made with us);
to exercise, establish or defend legal claims; and/or
to protect against fraudulent or abusive activity on our service.
This means we may keep different information for different periods. If your account is canceled because you haven’t used it for a long time, we may delete this information immediately.
There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize, or de-identify your personal information due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance, or other operational reasons. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to securely isolate your personal information from any further processing until such time as we are able to delete, anonymize, or de-identify it.
International data transfers
Unless you have provided us with consent to transfer your personal information, US Tax Preparation Information shall be processed and stored in the United States in accordance with applicable law.
With the exception noted above, Intuit reserves the right to store and process your personal information in the United States and in any other country where Intuit or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities in accordance with and as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
When we transfer, store or process personal information outside of your jurisdiction (including to or in the United States, as described above), we take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law.
Some of these recipients of your personal information are located in countries for which the European Commission, the UK (and Gibraltar) Government, and the Swiss Government (as and where applicable) have issued adequacy decisions, which means that these countries are recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under applicable UK (and Gibraltar), European, and Swiss data protection laws and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Other recipients of your personal information are located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK that are not the subject of an adequacy decision. In these cases, we may use the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or, as may be applicable, the International Data Transfer Agreement approved by the UK Government, to help ensure your personal information is protected. For more information on the transfer safeguards we rely on, please contact us by using the details in the “How to contact us” section below.
Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) and Mailchimp comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to the United States. Intuit and Mailchimp rely on the EU-U.S. DPF to transfer data and will rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF once approved by the appropriate authorities. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. You can find more information about Intuit’s and Mailchimp’s Data Privacy Framework certification

In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as employees and job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.

Opt-out of Sales and/or Sharing.
Like many companies, Intuit and Mailchimp use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as described above. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may classify our use of some of these services as “sharing” your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can opt-out of the “sharing” of your personal information by visiting the “Your California Privacy Rights” link in the footer of the Intuit website.
In addition, if you have enabled a recognized opt-out mechanism on your browser, device, or platform, you will automatically be opted out of any “sharings” when you interact with our Services. Please go here to learn more about enabling one such preference signal, the Global Privacy Control:
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download
. Intuit and Mailchimp do not sell personal information under the CCPA. Credit Karma does not sell or share personal information subject to the CCPA, and therefore does not offer a “Your California Privacy Rights” link on its website. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
Limit processing of sensitive personal information.
Some of the personal information that we may collect are considered sensitive personal information under the CCPA. We collect sensitive personal information for the purposes allowed by law or with your consent. We only use sensitive personal information as necessary for our (1) Service delivery and operations, (2) compliance and protection, (3) research and development, or (4) Service improvement and analytics purposes in accordance with CCPA. If we use sensitive personal information outside the permitted purposes of the CCPA, we will provide you with the right to limit processing of sensitive personal information.
California Shine the Light.
Customers who are California residents may request certain information concerning the categories of personal information (if any) we disclose to third parties or affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. If you would like more information, please submit a written request to us using the contact information provided below.
Non-discrimination
. You have the right to be free from discrimination or retaliation related to your exercise of any of your California privacy rights.
Verification.
In order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or deletion, we may require you to verify your credentials before you can submit a rights request. If you do not have an account with us, or if we suspect your account has been accessed without your authorization, we may ask you to provide additional personal information for verification. For Credit Karma members, we may require that you confirm certain pieces of personal information that we have on file and/or log into your Credit Karma account. If we are subsequently unable to confirm your identity, we may refuse your rights request.
Authorized agents.
You may use an authorized agent to submit a rights request. If you do so, the authorized agent must present signed written authorization to act on your behalf, and you will also be required to independently verify your own identity directly with us and confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the rights request. This verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent provides documentation showing that the authorized agent has power of attorney to act on your behalf under Cal. Prob. Code §§ 4121 to 4130.
Learn more about instructions for authorized agents.
We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit adequate proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.

Personal Information
References to “personal information” in this Privacy Statement are equivalent to “personal data” governed by EU and UK data protection laws. Essentially, “personal data” is information about an individual, where that individual is either directly identified or can be identified. It does not include ‘anonymous data’ (i.e., information where the identity of an individual has been permanently removed).
Legal Basis of Processing
We use your personal information only as permitted by law. Applicable EEA, UK(and Gibraltar) and Swiss data protection law requires us to have a “legal basis” for each purpose for which we collect your personal information. Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Statement will depend on the type of personal information and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally process personal information from you when:
We have your consent to do so;
We have a contract with you and it is necessary to process your personal information to perform our contract with you, including to provide you with the benefits of the Intuit Platform and operate our business;
The processing is in our legitimate business interests, such as operating our businesses, improving and developing the Intuit Platform, communicating with you, marketing our offerings and services and personalizing your experience, and to detect illegal activities; and/or
To comply with legal requirements, including applicable laws and regulations.
For residents in the UK searching for financial or other products (including energy, internet, or mobile phone offers) through the Intuit Platform, we may share your personal information, including your contact details, date of birth, as well as the information you give us about your employment, income, and housing and employment expenses with third parties, including HD Decisions, Capital One, Monevo, CarFinance 247, and Decision Tech. You can find more information about their data protection practices in their privacy policies:
