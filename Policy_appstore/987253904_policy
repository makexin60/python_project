Privacy Policy
Introduction
At Low Lag Labs we help mobile apps provide users with better connectivity and in-app experience on wireless networks (because nobody likes laggy internet). We work with mobile applications to improve mobile experiences that rely on connectivity.
Wireless network performance insights that improve mobile experiences are the foundation of our business, and we adopt a privacy-first approach when we handle any data from your device.
This privacy policy will inform you how we handle data collected from your device when you opt-in to data sharing through a mobile application operated by one of our app partners.
As further detailed below, Low Lag Labs does not collect any personal information that directly identifies individuals, and our products and services do not permit or require user identification.  Low Lag Labs does not sell personal data.
Data Collection
We collect data relating to wireless network performance to help answer questions such as:
What connectivity issues are mobile apps and their users experiencing?
Where and why are those issues happening?
How can those issues be resolved, and wireless network experience be improved?
Each App Partner (defined as a mobile application that satisfies our privacy requirements and integrates the Low Lag Labs Software Development Kit, or SDK) independently controls when the Low Lag Labs SDK is enabled to collect data. We mandate that our App Partners provide transparent disclosures to end-users, and that they only start our SDK after users opt-in. We audit our application partners to ensure that these requirements are being satisfied.
As part of our privacy-first approach, our SDK does not collect advertising ID, name, email, phone number, social media ID, contact list, or anything else which directly identifies an individual or their particular device. If and where the consent and disclosure requirements are met, our SDK may collect the following types of data:
Categories and Examples
Categories
Location
Device Information
Connection Details
Connection Quality
Usage Data
Identifiers
Crash Logs and Diagnostics
Information fromEnvironmental Sensors
Examples
GPS coordinates or similar information from the mobile device
Device hardware model, manufacturer, cellular radio model, sub-component manufacturers, and capabilities (e.g., CPU cores); mobile platform version; custom ROMs or Android skins
Network type, network operator, cellular and Wi-Fi signal strength and quality, identifiers of connected cell towers and Wi-Fi routers (BSSID, SSID)
Data flow speed measured both passively (monitoring movement through mobile apps) and actively (tests that download/upload data within the SDK)
Information on data usage flow, but not the content itself; monitoring of how fast data moves through apps or is actively tested during data download/upload
IP address, Resettable ID (unique to each installation of a mobile app, specific to Low Lag Labs, and generated for each new app installation or device reset)
Environmental sensors data such as acceleration, orientation, atmospheric pressure, light intensity, internal device conditions (e.g., battery temperature, voltage)
Data collected from sensors (if available on the device), including for example, acceleration, orientation, atmospheric pressure, light intensity, and internal conditions (e.g., battery temperature,voltage)
‍
Typical Uses of Categories of Information
Location - Understanding the wireless network quality where your device is located and providing suggestions to get better signal.
Device Information - Wireless device details are required to identify if specific network issues are limited to a device type or indoor/outdoor environments.
Connection Details - Used to separate data and results by operator and compare their performance, and congestion.
Connection Quality - Used to evaluate the performance of wireless networks to see if your device was experiencing poor signal coverage.
‍
The state of this application during a network test (e.g. “in use”), and information about how the SDK and app are used such as session duration, may be collected for data validation purposes. Low Lag Labs does not receive, see, or record any content viewed by users.
When a mobile application containing our SDK is installed and consent is provided, our software generates a unique identification code ("Resettable ID") for that specific installation instance rather than the device itself. Each mobile app on a particular device will generate a different, unique Resettable ID. Additionally, new installations of the same mobile app will also create new unique ResettableIDs. These Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, and never sold or shared with third parties. To further manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, which can help identify the telecom carrier network being accessed and impacting your experience.
We collect and send Crash Logs and Diagnostics data to help ensure that our software does not negatively impact your experience. Diagnostics data that we collect and send may include information about the performance of the app on the device. For example, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, or any technical diagnostics. Diagnostics data may be used for analytics, fraud prevention, security, or compliance purposes.
The goal of collecting the above data is to measure the experience you have of wireless networks.
The information from environmental sensors on your device (depending on which ones are integrated in your device), allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the atmospheric pressure and light intensity. Measurements on internal device conditions, such as battery temperature and voltage, help us understand how instantaneous device conditions affect the experience of wireless networks.
Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to create a detailed picture of the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time.
This privacy policy does not encompass or detail Low Lag Labs’s handling of internal employee or customer data. Our employees and customers may provide additional personal information such as contacts, names, email addresses, and phone numbers through the regular course of business and our non-public facing policies, which are available to those groups, govern the handling of that data.
If you contact us through
lowlaglabs.com/contact
or otherwise submit personal information via our website, insofar as permitted under applicable law, we may retain the information provided for our records and use it to respond to your inquiry, communicate with you in relation to our services, and/or otherwise process your request.
Purpose of Data Collection
We collect and process the data described in this privacy policy to support the following services (“Services”):
Help our App Partners understand how connectivity is affecting user experience;
Help provide actionable steps to App Partners for them to improve performance; and
Support the creation of depersonalized and/or aggregated insights and reports for telecom ecosystem companies to understand and improve connectivity.

Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, and misuse. Data collected by our SDK is encrypted in transit.
It is important to understand that no data storage system or data transmission over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, accurate, complete, or up-to-date. Please be aware that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as the information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for securing such information.
Country of Processing
The collection of data from devices takes place in the country where the device is used. We store and otherwise process data through third party cloud service providers who offer a range of global storage location options. The data we collect is shared with affiliated group entities in the United States for the purpose of the group’s data analysis and reporting purposes and an International Data Transfer Agreement, or IDTA, is in place to ensure the protection of the data when it leaves the United Kingdom, where we are based.
Data Retention
Any data collected by the Low Lag Labs SDK is retained only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. This includes meeting any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations. We may keep data for a longer period if there is an ongoing complaint or if we reasonably foresee potential litigation regarding our relationship with an end user.
When determining the appropriate retention period for data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process the data and whether those purposes can be achieved by other means, and the relevant legal requirements.
Lawful Basis for Processing
We gather and handle data with your explicit consent. You have the option to withdraw this consent at any time using the features available within the App Partner’s mobile application, such as the personal settings menu. This withdrawal will not impact the legality of any data processing conducted prior to the withdrawal of consent.

Privacy Policy Template Generator
Practically every single website worth anything out there has a Privacy Policy page that it can turn to whenever issues about privacy come up with users. That's why you really need to have a privacy policy, but it's not exactly that easy to make one, not if you really want to cover all of your bases. This is why you may want to look into the matter of
privacy policy template generator
(like ours here!) since it comes with quite a few benefits.
A privacy policy
is a legal document that details how a website gathers, stores, shares, and sells data about its visitors. This data typically includes items such as a user's name, address, birthday, marital status, medical history, and consumer behavior.
The specific contents of a privacy policy document depend upon the laws in the legal jurisdiction in which your business operates. Most countries have their own set of guidelines regarding what information is eligible for collection, and how that information may be used. Privacy laws include GDPR, CCPA, CalOPPA, PIPEDA, Australia Privacy Act and many more.
When it comes to legal documents, it is best not to take chances. Fortunately,
it's easy to get a free privacy policy in just a few minutes.
All you have to do is fill up the blank spaces on the right and we will create help you create
your own personalized privacy policy template for your business.
The accuracy of the generated document on this website is not legally binding. Use at your own risk.

Questions & Answers about Privacy Policies
Is A Privacy Policy Necessary?
In a word, absolutely. A privacy policy isn't just about telling your users what they can expected from your website, products, and services. It's about protecting you against potential liabilities that could arise from those aspects. It doesn't even have to be the users that go after you but also government agencies since they can be real sticklers for details.
More than the actual consequences of not having a privacy policy, it also helps to legitimize your website's authority if you have one. It just comes parts and parcel with having a successful online business.
What's A Privacy Policy Template?
For the most part, a privacy policy template is just what it sounds like. It's a template that was already made by somebody else and that you can use for your own website if you wanted to. This is incredibly helpful because creating a privacy policy from scratch can be a troublesome affair if you have no legal training. You would have to commission the help of a lawyer in order to do it right.
If your website is aiming for legitimacy, you definitely don't want to take this issue lightly. You can easily get in trouble with your customers and with the law if you don't have a privacy policy or if you have a bad one.
How Can I Use A Privacy Policy?
Usually, privacy policy templates are pretty straightforward. You can get one from a reputable source, copy the template and then paste it on your privacy page. Many of the relevant details will either be left blank or will need to be replaced. Either way, you need to be careful about the information that you put in the page.
You want to focus on company name or website name, the name of the site owner, company CEO, or web manager, and a few important details about purchases, service charges, and so on. Other than a few tweaks, a good template won't require much from you.
