Last updated on December 5th 2020.
Your privacy is important to us.
It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our app, Class Timetable, and our website, https://classtimetable.app.
Your data may be stored in iCloud.
We use iCloud to sync classes, tasks and settings across devices. We do not store any of this data ourselves; this is stored by Apple and is subject to their privacy policy. You can opt out of this by turning off iCloud.
We have access to anonymous usage statistics and crash reports.
Apple and Google App Stores make this data available to app developers. This data is used for the purpose of understanding app usage, and diagnosing crashes. We do not collect this data ourselves; we only use the data provided to us by Apple and Google.
We may ask you for permission to use device features.
Features we may ask for include notifications and Siri. These features are used solely for the purpose of improving the app experience, and we make it clear why and when these features are used. We don't use these features for anything other than their
              intended purpose. If you wish, you can opt out of using these features at any time.
This policy may be updated at any time.
Continued use of our app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.
