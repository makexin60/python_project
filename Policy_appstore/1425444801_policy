PRIVACY POLICY
Final Outpost is a freemium app. The app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
​
No personal data is collected inside the game, nor is viewable by us or shared with third parties.
We use Realm database to persist information locally on the device and entirely offline. This means when you delete your save-game all relevant information is discarded and never used by us.
​
We use anonymous crash-reporting services provided by Apple (opt-in only), Google and Unity to assist the debugging process. No data is collected that could be used to identify a user. We have access to the device type, OS version and time of crash. We can also see which actions were taken just before a crash.
