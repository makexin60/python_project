WHAT DO WE MEAN BY "PERSONAL INFORMATION?"
For us, â€œpersonal informationâ€ means information which identifies you, like your name or email address. Any information that falls outside of this is â€œnon-personal information.â€ If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.

HOW DO WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we will notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW?
We are a global organization and our computers are in several different places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.
