App Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. We do not collect, disclose, or transfer any data for any purpose. You can use the app to access your camera, microphone, or photos, but all data is stored locally on your device. If you use the beam blocks, the device may request Bluetooth (or Location) permissions - but OctoStudio will never access your Location information. You can export and send projects that you create in the app, but no data is ever transferred to us. The app does not track you in any way, does not contain any in-app purchases, and does not display any advertisements. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at
