See section 10 in this document to find out more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data.

Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data although we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
​
Purposes for which we will use your personal data
​
We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.
​
Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table at the end of this policy.
​
Marketing
​
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
​
Promotional offers from us
​
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
​
Third-party marketing
​
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
​

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you OR by contacting us at any time.

https://www.pushme.ie/cookie-policy.
Change of purpose
​
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
​
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
​
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
​
5. Disclosures of your personal data
​
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.
​
External third parties listed in section 3 above.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
​
6. International transfers
​
Some of our external third parties are based outside Ireland and the European Union (EU) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EU.
​
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
​
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
We will only use third parties that are ISO 27001 or SOC 2/SOC 3 certified
We will only use third parties where there is a data processing addendum, including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in place
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EU.
​
7. Data security
​
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
​
8. Data retention
​
How long will you use my personal data for?
​
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
​
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
​
By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for 6 years after they cease being customers.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [your legal rights] below for further information.
​
In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
​
You have the right to:
​
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
​
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
​
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
​
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
​
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
​
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Data Privacy Framework Annex I

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.

Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request

If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Privacy Policy
Updated November 2, 2023
This Privacy Policy governs the use of information collected by Nudge Coach, Inc (“Nudge,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” which terms shall include affiliates of Nudge Coach, Inc.) through the use of the Nudge Coach websites (the “Nudge Sites”), software applications (the “Nudge Apps”), and all Nudge products and services (collectively the “Services”) that direct you to this Privacy Policy.
Be advised that our processing of data obtained as a result of Nudge Customer and service provider relationships may also be governed by a separate
Data Processing Agreement
to address jurisdiction-specific data protection laws.
We provide this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect, how we use it, share it and protect it. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.
BY USING THE NUDGE SITES OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT VISIT THE WEBSITES, SET UP AN ACCOUNT OR USE THE SERVICES.
Information Gathering and Usage
When you register any account with any of the Nudge Apps or Services we may ask for information such as your name and email address. We will also ask you to create a secure password. We will store all of this information.
The Nudge Apps will collect Clipboard Data to extract an invite ID. This data will be used to connect you with a coach or company.
We will not collect your credit card information (but our payment processor will collect your credit card information and that information is subject to our payment processor’s terms, conditions and privacy policies).
You may choose to provide additional information to improve your experience or to enable Nudge Coaches to improve your experience. Any additional information you provide is strictly voluntary, and may be in any form, such as text, images, or video. You may upload an image into the Nudge Apps to be used as a profile picture, in a message to a Nudge Coach, or to share with other users in a Community.
You may also choose to provide additional information to us, such as when you contact us for technical support through the Services, participate in a poll or survey, or otherwise provide feedback on the Services.
We use collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact and research.
For users of Nudge Apps that support reading health data from bluetooth peripherals, the Android operating system requires that foreground and background location permissions be granted before the application can scan for and read from said bluetooth peripherals. We do not store or transmit any of location data. These permissions are only requested for the purpose of scanning and reading from bluetooth peripherals while the app is backgrounded.
We do not share your personal information with unrelated third parties unless explicitly approved by you. By using the Nudge Sites or Services you authorize this
list of Sub-Processors to process your data
.
We reserve the right to aggregate and redistribute data entered on the Website in accordance with our
Terms of Service
. The aggregated data we redistribute will never contain or be attached to Personal Data of any kind.
User Accounts and Data Privacy
Users of the Nudge Apps can share personal information with other users voluntarily and at their own risk by posting comments in “Communities” or opting into “Leaderboards”.
Please be advised that we do not perform any background searches on our users and that it is your responsibility to take care when sharing your information by posting in Communities or joining Leaderboards. For your security, your Personal Information is not discoverable by any other user until you choose to post a comment in a Community or opt-in to a Leaderboard.
At no time will Nudge or any employee of Nudge share, sell or otherwise distribute individual user data or personally identifiable information without the prior consent of the individual user.
We may choose to aggregate and redistribute data without providing information identifying specific subscribing organizations, companies or individual users without prior consent.
Sharing Your Data With A Nudge Coach
A “Nudge Coach” is an authorized Representative of a Customer of Nudge who provides services on behalf of that organization.
If you accept an invitation to connect with a Nudge Coach, you grant them access to all personal and health-related data in your account. This includes data that may be manually entered by you, or data that you choose to sync into the Nudge Apps by enabling one of our integrations.
Your data provides Nudge Coaches the up-to-date information they require in order to deliver their services effectively.
If you accept an invitation from a Nudge Coach, the Nudge Coach will also be able to send private messages to you. The Nudge Coach has agreed to keep your data and information confidential and not use it for any purpose other than to provide you individualized advice and services, but we cannot provide any assurances that any Nudge Coach will in fact do so.
We are not required to litigate or otherwise pursue any wrongful disclosure of your data and information. To the extent that any of your data or information contains protected health information, you hereby expressly consent to the disclosure of such protected health information when you accept an invitation from a Nudge Coach.

Security Measures
at all times in order to reduce the risk of breach or incident.

HubSpot is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to the personal data we collect and process in the course of our business. HubSpot acts in different ways when processing data:
(i) HubSpot acts as a controller of your personal data when you sign up for our products and services, visit our websites or interact with us through other channels (for example in person events). We use this data for a variety of purposes, including to provide our products and services to you, contact you about relevant content, and improve and promote our products and services.
(ii) HubSpot acts as a processor when our customers use our products and services to collect and process personal data in connection with their sales, marketing, and other business activities. In this case, we act as a processor (or service provider) on behalf of our customers (who are controllers of personal data) under the HubSpot
Data Processing Agreement
included in the
Customer Terms of Service
.
(iii) HubSpot also acts as a controller when we collect and process personal data about individuals in their professional capacity, and make that information available to customers for their own sales, marketing, and other business activities. This includes personal data we may collect indirectly about you, such as from publicly available sources, our customers, or other third parties. For more information see the “What Information We Collect and Process” section.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy "Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. This Privacy Policy describes your choices and rights with respect to your Personal Data, including your rights of access and correction.

We also use your information to recommend new products and services and to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter and analyzing product outages or bugs.
If you use the HubSpot mobile applications, we may send you push notifications from time to time in order to update you about events and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
2.2 To Provide the Subscription Service. We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product and services to you.

2.3 To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services. We use professional data, log files, and usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services to develop and improve our products and services.

knowledge base article to learn more about how your Customer Data is being used to train HubSpot models.
2.4 To Secure and Protect our Product and HubSpot Users. We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents.

This includes enforcing our
Acceptable Use Policy
.
We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns, investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we associate automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
2.5 To Market and Promote the Subscription Service. We use Personal Data to advertise, market, and promote our products, services, and other offerings. For example, we use information like your email or physical address to send information or HubSpot content to you we think may be of interest to you, including by post, email, or other means.  We may also send you marketing communications relating to our business.
You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each communication that we send to you. If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to respond to your requests.
We may reach out to you via telephone to ask about other HubSpot products or services you may be interested in.

You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded.  We may also reach out to you via SMS, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt out of those communications.
Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent. Otherwise, we will market and advertise our products and services on the basis of our legitimate business interests.

here
.
Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data or performing statistical analysis on your use of the Subscription Service or interactions on our websites, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies and standards.

GOOGLE USER DATA
IMPORTANT:
Snovio's use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to
Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
We analyze all new email in your Inbox using automated algorithms and, in the event they received as answer to emails sent via campaigns and single send email option, we will store them (with all text information, attaches and images) and record the results of the analysis to provide accurate campaign functioning, campaign statistics, demonstrate the content of the emails to the user (to which Snovio does not have access), and ensure operability of the Remind Me feature in case the sent email receives no reply.
We do not access your Sent emails through your Gmail account.
We use access to draft sending in your Gmail account to ensure the operability of the Send Later feature.
We may add a
tracking pixel
to the body of emails sent through our service to track email opens and wrap your links with tracking domain to track link clicks. We use the data acquired through these tracking methods to maintain email campaign operability and provide campaign reports.
You may revoke Snovio’s access to your Gmail account in the Account’s settings page
here
. If you decide to do so, we will lose access to your Gmail account and will no longer be able to provide you campaign sending services through Gmail API.
We delete all data collected from your Gmail account upon request.
Not all Google User Data may contain personal data. Some statistical data will be anonymized.
With regard to the access to Google User Data as specified above, we will:
only use access to read, write, modify, or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email client that allows users to compose, send, read, and process emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets;
not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements;
not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for the Platform's internal operations and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.
As part of the Unibox functionality, the Company may access and process inbox emails, in accordance with the settings configured by the user. This data is collected solely for the purpose of enabling the requested functionality of the Platform, including syncing and organizing emails based on the defined preferences.
SNOVIO EXTENSIONS AND INTEGRATIONS
You may use our extensions, namely Email Finder, Li Prospect Finder, Unlimited Email Tracker, Email Verifier, and Web Technology Checker to facilitate your email campaigns to your potential business partners.
Email Finder and LI Prospect Finder
To use the extensions, you need to be registered at and logged into app.snov.io. Upon installation and activation of the extensions, the extensions may collect personal information such as email addresses and business profiles from publicly available sources. Handling and storing of this information in your account on your behalf occurs only at your request. At the same time, we may store certain information obtained when you use the LI Prospect Finder extension such as business profiles you visited. This data is stored in our database and can be found through a search inside the Platform.
If you do not want your personal data to be included as part of our service, you may
opt-out
by contacting us at
help@snov.io
or opt-out from all mailing lists on the Platform through this

Unlimited Email Tracker
The extension may require authorization in our web application (app.snov.io). Additionally, to use the Send Later and Remind Me features you must allow Snovio to access your Google account. You can learn more about how Snovio uses your Google data in the ‘GOOGLE USER DATA’ section of this Policy.
You can send emails through your usual Gmail interface and Unlimited Email Tracker extension will provide tracking information. We’ll let you know if we think your emails have been opened and how many times. We store the subject and message ID of emails for the open notifications only. We use them for tracking, as well as to enable the ‘Send Later’ and ‘Remind Me’ features. We store message ID, subject, sender, and recipient of an email for fraud prevention purposes within the period specified in ‘DATA SECURITY, INTEGRITY, AND RETENTION’ section of this Policy.
Email Verifier
To use the extension, you need to be registered at and logged into app.snov.io. The extension may collect email addresses from the websites you visit. We store the data only upon your request, and only if you click the "Save" button.
Website Technology Checker
To use the extension, you don't need to be registered at or logged into app.snov.io. This extension collects the information about websites using specific web technologies (non-personal data). We only store domains from visited websites to help us provide a better user experience.
Depending on your device and OS version, we have to request you to approve certain permissions for collection and processing of your personal data to enable the operation of the Email Finder, Li Prospect Finder, Unlimited Email Tracker, Email Verifier and Web Technology Checker extensions.

Third-Party Integrations
On our Platform we enable users to use our integration with HubSpot or Pipedrive service to synchronize Prospect and Business data from their Snovio account with data about contacts stored in their HubSpot or Pipedrive account. When you integrate your HubSpot or Pipedrive account with our Platform, the data is transferred from your Snovio account to the HubSpot or Pipedrive account and from the Hubspot or Pipedrive account to your Snovio account in order to synchronize data between both platforms.
By enabling third-party integration, you potentially allow the third-party platform to access your data. We highly recommend reviewing the privacy practices implemented by the third-party services before enabling any integrations with them. You may read HubSpot’s Privacy Policy
here
and Pipedrive’s Privacy Notice
here
.
Email AI (Integration with OpenAI API)
The clients can use Email AI feature to write and edit the email text (including the email tone and language) and/or generate the email subject line according to the provided information. We use OpenAI's API to provide clients with the Email AI feature, available to fee-based plans. The Email AI feature is available by default, but the client can deactivate it on any occasion.
When the client uses the Email AI feature, we will transmit the client email's textual content to OpenAI to generate or edit the text and/or subject line according to the provided information. Be aware the generated email text and/or email subject line may occasionally be inaccurate due to the nature of machine learning. The client is solely responsible for reviewing the generated text and/or subject line.
Please note, Snovio and OpenAI may retain the information you provide us with while using the Email AI feature for a limited period of time. You can learn more about how long your Email AI data is stored and processed below in the ‘DATA SECURITY, INTEGRITY, AND RETENTION’ section of this Policy.
We highly recommend reviewing the privacy practices implemented by OpenAI before using the Email AI feature. You may read
OpenAI Sharing & publication policy
,
OpenAI API data usage policies
and
Open AI Usage policies
.
My Team Functionality
The client, acting as a team lead, has the ability to invite other individuals to join the Platform. If the invited individual is already registered on the Platform, they can use the account to join the team. If the invited individual does not have an account, they will be required to register on the Platform in order to join the team.
The team lead has the authority to configure and manage permissions within the My Team functionality, which determines the level of access each team member has to other members' data. By joining the team, team members acknowledge and agree to the access settings and permissions established by the team lead.
Team members can leave the team at any time. In this case, they lose access to team-related data and any permissions granted to them.
Unibox Functionality
Unibox is a feature within the Platform that allows users to sync, categorize, and manage emails in real-time, enabling centralized email organization. Users can connect their email accounts to Unibox to import emails, access previous correspondence, and manage team-based email visibility based on access control settings (if any).
When a user enables Unibox functionality, emails from the connected email account are imported and synchronized into the Platform under the client’s settings. If the My Team functionality is utilized, certain emails may be accessible to other authorized team members based on the status of the sender's account (whether shared or private) and restrictions defined by the team lead.
If the sender's account is removed from the Unibox functionality, all data associated with the account will be deleted. Also, the user can manually delete their data through the available option in the Unibox functionality settings. Additionally, if a user has not logged into the Platform for a period of more than 90 days or deleted their sender account from the Platform, all data associated with their account will be deleted from the Unibox functionality.
MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
To keep users informed about our new products and services, we may send them promotional messages via SMS or email.
We may send SMS messages under legal bases as defined in the ‘HOW WE USE YOUR DATA’ section of this Policy. During the sign-up process, clients are provided with a checkbox to opt in to receive marketing communications. By selecting this checkbox, clients are actively providing their consent to receive marketing messages from us. This step is optional, and clients can skip the checkbox and proceed with the sign-up process if they prefer not to receive any marketing communications.
For clients registered on the Platform prior to the implementation of this option, marketing messages may be sent based on the Company's legitimate interests. However, these clients retain the right to opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time as defined in this Policy.
We can send marketing communications promoting our similar products and services by email under our legitimate interests. We have conducted a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA) to assess that this processing is necessary and balanced against the rights and freedoms of our clients.
Opportunity to withdraw consent or opt-out
Clients can opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time. The first marketing SMS message we send and every email include a link to unsubscribe from receiving marketing communications. If the client wants to stop receiving further marketing content from us, they can follow the link and withdraw their consent or opt out. In any case, the client can withdraw their consent or opt out through other available options as specified in the ‘GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING’ section of this Policy.

(for up to 30 days at the moment of updating our Privacy Policy).
We store
