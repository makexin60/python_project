Privacy Commitment
Railer doesn't collect or share any of your data to anyone. Our website doesn't even use cookies.
App Data Usage
Only with your permission, Railer uses some personal data to improve its workings, e.g.:
Location data is used to determine the nearest stations around you while searching, and in the widget to switch the direction of your Super Favorite.
Calendar access is used only to present you a list of calendars, so you can choose in which calendar Railer can add your train itinerary. The contents of your calendars are never read.
As of version 1.9, Railer no longer collects statistics or crash data through a third party service. If you want to help us anonymously with keeping Railer crash free, go to the Settings app on your device and turn on Privacy > Analytics > Share With App Developers.
