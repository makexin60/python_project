Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes what information DK Pictures, Inc. (“DK Pictures,” or “we”) collects on doink.com (the "Site") and through our downloadable apps,
Animation & Drawing by Do Ink
and
Green Screen by Do Ink
(the "Apps"), how we may use that information, and with whom we may share it.
Before going into the details of what information we may collect, here are some of the things we
do not
do:
We
do
not
display any advertising within the Apps or on the Site.
We
do
not
expose children to any form of social networking.
We
do
not
sell digital goods within the Apps or on the Site.
We
do
not
enable Internet browsing within the Apps.
We
do
not
collect personal data that would allow us to identify specific users, either in the Apps or on the Site.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We may obtain information from you in three ways: through the collection of aggregated usage data in the Apps, through automatic analytics tools on the Site, and through direct communications with you, via email and the like, regarding support and customer service.
AGGREGATED USAGE DATA IN THE APPS
The Apps do not collect any information that would enable us to identify specific users of the app; however, they do collect aggregated usage data that allows us to understand how people are using the Apps and to identify and fix problems in the Apps.
We receive this data from two sources. First, Apple Inc. provides use with aggregated usage metrics that help us understand which iOS devices (
i.e.
, iPad models) the Apps are used on, which versions of iOS are in use, what geographic regions of the world our users are located in, and other information of a similar nature. Second, we use the "Crashlytics" and "Fabric" tools provided by Twitter Inc. to collect aggregated crash reports and user metrics, which we use to identify and diagnose bugs in the Apps and to understand how the Apps are being used.
The information from these services does not allow us to identify specific users of the Apps. We use this information to understand how the Apps are being used and to identify bugs in the Apps, greatly expanding our ability to improve and enhance the Apps. The aggregated information is used internally within DK Pictures and is never shared with any third party.
AUTOMATIC ANALTTICS TOOLS ON THE SITE
This Site is hosted by Squarespace, Inc., which provides us with aggregated usage metrics – for example, the number of visitors to the Site and the number of page views on a particular day. We use this information to understand how people are using the Site, which helps us identify ways to improve the Site. No information is collected that would enable us to identify specific users of the Site, and the aggregated data is never shared with any third party.
DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH USERS
If you ever have occasion to communicate with us directly – to receive customer support, for example – we may ask you to share information about your use of the Apps that is more detailed than what we collect using automated means. If you provide additional information, it will be used only to address the specific issue about which you contacted us. We will never share your contact information with any third party.
We may retain your name, your email address, and other contact information that you provide in a private database. We may use your contact information to notify you about product updates and other information that we deem relevant. You may opt out of any future communications by notifying us at
support@doink.com
.
UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically, without prior notice to you. If we do that, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on our Site and indicate when it was updated.
CONTACTING US
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, or if you would like us to update information we have about you or your preferences, please send a detailed message
support@doink.com
