3. Automatic data processing when visiting our Website - purposes and legal basis
It is possible to visit our Website and use it for informational purposes only without having to provide any personal data (for example, by registering or submitting data in online forms). In order for you to view our Website and use it in a user-friendly, effective, stable and secure manner, we automatically collect and process the necessary pseudonymized technical data in conjunction with your terminal device and browser.
a. Automatic data collection and processing by web server
In order to display the individual pages on our Website, our web servers automatically collect and process the following personal data transmitted by your browser:
The viewed address on the web server (URL)
The “user-agent” ID that contains additional information depending on the browser
•   Operating system used
•   Browser type and version
Referrer URL (last page visited, if transmitted from this page)
Date and time of the server request
IP address
These data are temporarily stored in so-called server log files. These data are not evaluated based on your person, and they are not associated with other data sources.
The pseudonymized technical communication data collected and processed to enable the use of the Website (connection setup) are temporarily stored in so-called server log files on our web servers. We use the server log files for internal system-related purposes, in particular for technical administration and to ensure the stability and security of our web server and Website, e.g., to identify and track any invalid or abusive attempts to access our web server via the saved IP address. The legal basis for this data processing of server log files is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR, which allows the processing of personal data within the scope of our legitimate interests, unless your fundamental rights, freedoms or interests prevail. Our legitimate interests are easy administration and secure operation of our Website.
b. Use of cookies
In order to make the visit to our Website user-friendly and attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, we sometimes use so-called “cookies” on our Website. These are small text files stored on your terminal device associated with the browser you are using and through which certain information flows to the entity that sets the cookie (in this case us).
Cookies cannot execute programs, transfer viruses to your terminal device or cause any other damage to your terminal device.
Some of the cookies we use are deleted at the end of the browser session, i.e., once you close your browser (“session cookies”). With the help of session cookies, various requests from your browser can be assigned to a joint session. This allows us to recognize your browser when you use multiple web pages of our Website or if you return to our Website without closing your browser. We use session cookies to provide certain features that you have made use of. A different kind of cookie (so-called persistent cookies) remain on your device for a specified time and allow us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our site.
Persistent cookies have an expiration date and thus are automatically deleted after a certain period of time. You can also delete them manually at any time in the security settings of your browser.
You can change the settings in your browser so that you will be informed whenever cookies are placed and allow individual cookies, refuse cookies in certain cases or in general, as well as activate the automatic deletion of cookies as soon as the browser is closed. In case of generally disabling cookies, the functionality of this Website may be restricted, as some of the cookies serve the correct functioning of this Website.
In the case of technically necessary cookies and (in part) in the case of functional cookies, the legal basis for the data processing carried out with cookies is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR / Art. 25(2) of the German Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act (TDDDG), which permits the processing of personal data within the scope of our legitimate interests, unless your fundamental rights, freedoms or interests prevail. Our legitimate interests lie in ensuring the technically correct and optimized display of our Website and certain features and the offers of our Website as requested by you.
The legal basis for the data processing carried out using cookies is, in the case of cookies that are not technically necessary, i.e., for the analysis and statistics cookies, marketing cookies and, in part, for functional cookies for example, your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR / Art. 25(1) TDDDG.
You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.
Details on cookies as well as an overview of the cookies used can be viewed at any time and on all pages of our Internet presence, under the gear-icon which is at the bottom left of all pages. Here you can also revoke your consent.
c. Social Media
We integrate the social networks of the providers: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, XING, Kununu, Instagram and TikTok (“social media”) on our Website. We also maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks.

Item 1. General information on data collection and processing through social media
Note
: This section describes the general mechanisms of data collection and processing by social media services when integrated into a website. In the following section (2), we specifically address how we have integrated social media services into our website in order to offer you their use with the least possible impact on your privacy.
The respective provider may store the data collected about you as usage profiles, and use them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation is done (even for users who are not logged in) to display demand-oriented advertising and to inform other users in the social network about your activities on our site.
You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective provider to exercise this right.
By integrating social media functions into our Website, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users in order that we can improve our web offering and design it to be more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for integrating social media is your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR.
You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.
Data transfer possibly takes place regardless of whether you have an account with the social media provider and are logged in with it. If you are logged in to the social media provider, your data collected on a website are directly assigned to your account with the social media provider. For example, if you click a “Share” button to share the page you are viewing on a social network, the respective social media provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it with your contacts publicly or restricted (depending on your settings with the provider).
If this is not intended, we recommend you logging out regularly after using a social network, as this will help you avoid having your usage assigned to your profile with the social media provider.
We have no influence over the data collected and data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of the data collection, the purposes of processing, the storage periods and other information. For more information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the respective provider as well as your rights and options to protect your privacy, please refer to the respective provider’s privacy policy.
On our Website, social media features are used specifically as described below:
Item 2. Social media buttons on the Website
Many pages of our Website integrate so-called “social media buttons” of the providers Facebook, Twitter, XING and LinkedIn, among others.
The buttons are integrated into the page by means of a “Shariff” mechanism from the publisher “heise online” to increase the protection of your data when visiting our Website. This embedding ensures that no connection to Facebook, Twitter, XING and LinkedIn’s servers is established when accessing a page on our Website that contains these buttons. Only when you actively click on the button from the respective provider (Facebook: “share”; Twitter: “tweet”; XING: “share”; LinkedIn: “share”) and thus give your consent to data transfer, your browser establishes a direct connection between the servers of the respective provider. By clicking, the providers receive the information that your browser has called up the relevant page of our web presence, even if you do not have a profile with the respective provider or you are currently not logged in. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a server from the respective provider where it is stored. In the case of the social media buttons from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, the data are transmitted to the USA.
If you are logged into one of the social networks, the providers can directly assign your visit to our Website to your profile on Facebook, Twitter, XING or LinkedIn. If you use the buttons, for example by pressing the “tweet” button from Twitter, the relevant information is also transmitted directly to a server from the provider where it is stored. The information will also be published on the social network or your Twitter account, where it is displayed for your contacts.
If you don’t want Facebook, Twitter, XING and LinkedIn to directly assign the data collected via our web presence to your profile in the respective media service, you should not click on any of the buttons on our Website
.
4. Collection and processing of data provided by you—purposes and legal basis
The use of certain functions of our Website, such as the contact forms or the e-mail newsletter, requires the collection and processing of personal data. We only process such data on our Website if you provide it to us yourself and this is permitted by law.
If, in addition, your prior consent is required for certain data collection and processing, we will ask for your consent at the relevant place on our Website. This declaration of consent is logged by us. You are entitled to revoke any consent you have given in whole or in part at any time, with effect for the future. Such a revocation will also be logged by us.
a. Contact and request forms / application forms
We provide numerous forms on our Website for you to send us requests on various topics.
Item 1. Order form / product request (Art. 6(1)(1)(a, b) GDPR)
There are order forms on our Website that can be used for electronic orders (e.g., samples/catalogs). If you place an order via such a form, we will process the data you provide exclusively for processing and shipping the order, or to prepare relevant offers (cross-reference request).
The principle of data economy and data avoidance is observed here, in that you only have to provide the data that we absolutely need from you to process the order. This information is marked with an asterisk as a mandatory field.
In addition, your IP address is processed for technical necessity as well as for legal protection. All other data are voluntary fields and can be specified optionally.
We implement the appropriate security measures to best protect the security and confidentiality of your data. Your request is transmitted to us in encrypted form.
The data collected is only stored by us as long as it is necessary for processing your request or if we are legally obliged to store it. The data will then be deleted.
To protect against fraudulent use, we use the privacy-friendly service Friendly Captcha. You can find out more about this service by clicking on the gear-icon, which is always located at the bottom left of all pages of our Internet presence.
Item 2. Requesting a quotation and ordering samples (Art. 6(1)(1)(a, b) GDPR)
If you would like to request a quotation and order a free sample, we will use the form provided for this purpose, but not necessarily exclusively, to collect and process your name, company, postal address and the products/samples. In any case, we always observe the principle of data economy and data avoidance by only requiring you to provide the data that we absolutely need from you for the purpose of sending you a quotation and a sample. The collection and processing of these data is necessary to provide the services you have ordered and is based on Art. 6(1)(1)(b) GDPR. Without these data, which are marked as mandatory, we cannot provide you with a quotation or free sample. Specification of the country is also mandatory. Depending on which country you select in the selection option, it may be the case that your data are transferred to a third country, i.e., a country outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. Insofar as this data transfer is not already lawful on the basis of an “adequacy decision” pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR to which this destination country is subject, we base such third-country data transfers on the appropriate guarantee of the Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) pursuant to Art. 46(2)(b) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 47 GDPR. These BCRs legitimize cross-border data transfers between companies belonging to the Group, i.e., also between the various international storage locations for the companies of the Würth Elektronik eiSos Group.
You can also provide us with additional voluntarily information in the form. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR, which permits the processing of personal data within the scope of the “legitimate interest” of the data controller, unless your fundamental rights, freedoms or interests prevail. Our legitimate interest is to address you more personally or, for example, to increase or accelerate the service for you through the option of queries. For data processing pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, you have the
right to object
to just this data processing
pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR
. In order to assert your data subject rights, you can contact us at any time at
data-protection@we-online.com
or send a message to the address(es) given under item 1.
In the order form for quotations and samples, you can voluntarily tick the box next to “Save form data”. In this case, we store the data you enter for selected fields in a cookie.
If you fill out the form again at a later time, these data will be called up automatically so that you do not have to enter the data again. The data are stored locally on the terminal device you are using. Any previously saved data in the cookie for the same form will be overwritten. The legal basis for this data processing is your active consent to Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR.
You can revoke the processing of this cookie and thus delete the data already stored by submitting the form again without the checkbox activated, or by deleting the form cookies (name starts with “WE form”) in your local browser settings.
To protect against fraudulent use, we use the privacy-friendly service Friendly Captcha in conjunction with the order form for quotations and samples. You can find out more about this service by clicking on the gear-icon, which is always located at the bottom left of all pages of our Internet presence.
Item 3. Contact form / Making contact by e-mail (Art. 6(1)(1)(a, b) GDPR)
There are contact forms on our website that can be used to contact us electronically. If you write to us using a contact form, we will process the data you provide in the contact form to contact you and answer your questions and requests.
The principle of data economy and data avoidance is observed here, in that you only have to provide the data that we absolutely need from you to make contact. This information is marked with an asterisk as a mandatory field. In addition, your IP address is processed for technical necessity as well as for legal protection. All other data are voluntary fields and can be specified optionally (e.g., to individually answer your questions).
We implement the appropriate security measures to best protect the security and confidentiality of your data. Your request is transmitted to us in encrypted form.
If you contact us by e-mail, we will process the personal data provided in the e-mail solely for the purpose of processing your request.
The data collected is only stored by us as long as it is necessary for processing your request or if we are legally obliged to store it. The data will then be deleted.
To protect against fraudulent use, we use the privacy-friendly service Friendly Captcha in conjunction with the contact form. You can find out more about this service by clicking on the gear-icon, which is always located at the bottom left of all pages of our Internet presence.
Item 4. Invoicing (Art. 6(1)(1)(a, b) GDPR)
You have the option to switch to electronic invoicing using the confirmation form provided. In this context, we process your specified data exclusively for the stated purpose.
The data collected is only stored by us as long as it is necessary for processing your request or if we are legally obliged to store it. The data will then be deleted.
Item 5. Download form (Art. 6(1)(1)(a, b) GDPR)
On our website you have the option of receiving information by download. If you request documents via such a form, we will process the data you provide exclusively for this purpose.
The principle of data economy and data avoidance is observed here, in that you only have to provide the data that we absolutely need from you to process the order. This information is marked with an asterisk as a mandatory field. In addition, your IP address is processed for technical necessity as well as for legal protection. All other data are voluntary fields and can be specified optionally.
The data collected is only stored by us as long as it is necessary for processing your request or if we are legally obliged to store it. The data will then be deleted.
To protect against fraudulent use, we use the privacy-friendly service Friendly Captcha in conjunction with the download form. You can find out more about this service by clicking on the gear-icon, which is always located at the bottom left of all pages on our Website.
Item 6. Application form (Art. 6(1)(1)(a, b) GDPR; Art. 26 (1) (1) of the German federal data protection act (BDSG))
On our Website you will find a variety of current job offers. You can apply for advertised jobs using the application form provided for the respective job offer. We also provide you the opportunity to apply to us on your own initiative. Here we process your data provided in the application form or the documents you uploaded.
The principle of data economy and data avoidance is observed here, in that you only have to provide data or upload documents that we absolutely need from you to conduct the application process or that we are legally obligated to collect.
This information is marked with an asterisk as a mandatory field. In addition, your IP address is processed for technical necessity as well as for legal protection. All other data are voluntary fields and can be specified optionally.
We implement the appropriate security measures to best protect the security and confidentiality of your data. The data you provide will be transmitted to us in encrypted form.
Only those persons who need the applicant data to fulfill their tasks, in particular to conduct the application process, are granted access to the applicant data by the data controller.
The data collected are stored by us as long as it is necessary for the decision about the employment relationship, or if we are legally obliged to store it.
We also retain your personal data for the defense of legal claims pursuant to Art. 17(3)(e) GDPR for six months after completion or withdrawal of your application.
Below the application form, you are also given the opportunity to provide your consent to be included in the applicant pool. In this case, the personal data you provide in the application form will be stored for a further 12 months after conclusion of your application process in order to be able to possibly offer you another job at a later date.
Furthermore, you are given the option to provide your consent for forwarding your applicant data within the Würth Elektronik Group. In this case, the personal data you provide in the application form will be transferred to the other companies of the Würth Elektronik Group in the European Union and Switzerland and are stored for 12 months after conclusion of your application process in order to possibly offer you another job at a later date. A list of the companies in the Würth Elektronik Group to which your applicant data may be transferred with the submission of your consent can be found here.
The consent mentioned above is voluntary and has no impact whatsoever on the chances of the application process. You can also withdraw your consent at any time, for example by sending an e-mail to
data-protection@we-online.com
.
Revocation of your consent also has no impact whatsoever on your chances of the application process.
In the event that you provide us with “special categories” of personal data in your letter of application or in the documents submitted (e.g., information on severe disability, ethnic origin, etc.), your consent also expressly refers to these data; Art. 26(3)(2) BDSG.
Social-Media Recruiting
In addition, interested persons have the opportunity to get in touch with us directly via our social media recruiting campaigns. For this purpose, the interested person answers a few questions about his or her previous professional career. We also need some personal contact details of the interested person. This includes the first and last name, the e-mail address and the postcode of the place of residence. In accordance with the principle of data economy pursuant to Art. 5 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, we only collect and process personal data that is necessary to achieve the purpose (employee acquisition).
The data obtained by clicking on the selection fields and by proactively providing the personal data of the interested person will be used by us in accordance with the principle of purpose limitation pursuant to Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, exclusively for the purpose of contacting the interested person without obligation.
Your data may be viewed not only by us, but also by our recruiting campaign service provider based in Germany. This inspection is necessary for the optimisation of the social media recruiting campaigns.
The required contractual framework is available in the form of the order processing contract and the confidentiality agreement concluded with NIRO Media UG.
With regard to the processing of personal data by the social media platforms on which we are active, please note section 3 letter c and section 3 point 1 of this data protection notice.
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of the social media recruiting campaigns is your consent in the sense of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time, without giving reasons and with effect for the future, at data-protection@we-online.com (Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR). The purpose of the revocation is that we irrevocably delete the personal data transmitted by you in accordance with Art. 17 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, insofar as an immediate deletion is not precluded by any other legal obligation to retain data in accordance with Art. 17 para. 3 lit. b GDPR.
In the event of concrete discussions about a possible cooperation, we transfer the personal data you have provided to our application management system. In this system, we retain your personal data for the defence of legal claims in accordance with Art. 17 para. 3 lit. e of the GDPR for six months after completion of the application process or withdrawal of your application.
Item 7. Expert search / Find your engineer (Art. 6(1)(1)(a, b) GDPR)
You will find a form on our Website which you can submit to us for the expert search. If you write to us using this form, we will process the data you provide in the form in order to find a suitable expert for you from our network of experts.
The principle of data economy and data avoidance is observed here, in that you only have to provide the data that we absolutely need from you to make contact and search for an expert. This information is marked with an asterisk as a mandatory field. Your data, except for your contact data, will be forwarded to the Expert Network. Forwarding of your data to the Expert Network is therefore completely anonymous and does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your person. As soon as we have found feedback from interested experts for you and your concerns, we will provide you with the contact details of these experts by phone or e-mail.
The data you provide in the form will also be made available to one of our sales representatives, so we can assist you if you are unable to find the right expert in our Expert Network. But also in case you have found what you are looking for in our Expert Network, we may process your (contact) data provided to contact you in order to be able to support you together with your expert.
In addition, your IP address is processed for technical necessity as well as for legal protection. All other data are voluntary fields and can be specified optionally (e.g., for individual processing).
We implement the appropriate security measures to best protect the security and confidentiality of your data. Your request is transmitted to us in encrypted form.
The data collected are only stored by us as long as it is necessary to process your concern or if we are legally obliged to store them. The data will then be deleted.
To protect against fraudulent use, we use the privacy-friendly service Friendly Captcha. You can find out more about this service by clicking on tze gear-icon, which is always located at the bottom left of all pages on our Website.
b. E-mail newsletter
In addition, you can register to receive our email newsletter by using the form provided for this purpose on our Website. With your consent, we process the personal data provided in the form to inform you about Würth Elektronik products, events and seminars with an e-mail newsletter.
Specification of your e-mail address as well as selection of the business units of the Würth Elektronik Group from which you would like to receive newsletters are mandatory for the selection and dispatch of the newsletter(s) appropriate for you. The legal basis for processing this data is your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time and unsubscribe from the e-mail newsletter. This is possible with the unsubscribe link included in every newsletter.
You may also provide us with additional personal data voluntarily to enable us to address you more personally.
You also have the option of giving your consent for newsletter tracking pursuant to Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR. With your consent, you agree that we evaluate your newsletter activity, as well as your user behavior, in order to be able to continue to guarantee the accustomed quality of our newsletters. For example, we can determine whether a newsletter item has been opened and whether and which links in the newsletter item have been clicked on.
However, we would like to explicitly point out that the possibility of receiving the newsletter still exists if you do not agree to newsletter tracking.
You can revoke your consent to newsletter tracking at any time. This is possible by removing the tracking check in your personal newsletter profile that you can access in each newsletter.
We would like to explicitly point out that the possibility of continuing to receive the newsletter still exists if you revoke your consent to newsletter tracking.
We use the “double opt-in procedure” for registering to our newsletter and—if you select it—for newsletter tracking. This means that after you register, we will send you an e-mail to the e-mail address you provided, in which we ask you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter and—if you select it—tracking of the newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration(s) within 24 hours, your information will be automatically deleted. We also store your IP addresses and the times of registration and confirmation. The purpose of the procedure is to be able to prove your registration and, if necessary, to clarify any fraudulent use of your personal data.
The e-mail newsletter is sent on our behalf by mailingwork GmbH, Birkenweg 7, 09569 - Oederan OT Memmendorf, Germany (“mailingwork”). Mailingwork is a service that can be used, among other things, to organize and analyze the dispatch of newsletters. We pass on the data you have entered in the e-mail newsletter form to mailingwork for the purpose of dispatching the newsletter. The data are stored on mailingwork's servers in Germany. Mailingwork acts as a processor for us pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.
c. Opening and managing a Würth Elektronik user account
With the WE ID registration of Würth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co. KG and Würth Elektronik GmbH & Co. KG (CBT) and their affiliated companies (hereinafter referred to as "Würth Elektronik"), you will receive your individual access to the online services of Würth Elektronik. "Affiliated companies" are companies in which a contracting party directly or indirectly holds more than half of the votes, or has the power to appoint more than half of the members of the supervisory board, the management board or the bodies appointed to legally represent the company, or has the right to manage the company's business.
The online service offering includes all Würth Elektronik offerings that require individual access for use:
REDEXPERT
WEdirekt
MyWE
When you register, we always observe the principle of data minimization and data avoidance by only requiring you to provide the data that we absolutely need for your registration and the associated creation of your personal user account.
Registration takes place in two consecutive steps:
1.)    Ping Identity:
Ping Identity is an identity and authentication application. The information required for this registration step is marked with an asterisk as a mandatory field. These are your title, first name, surname and e-mail address. To prevent unauthorized access to your Ping Identity account by third parties, you must set a personal password during registration. After submitting the registration form on Ping Identity, we will send you an e-mail with a registration code, which you will need to confirm your registration. By entering the registration code in the input mask provided, you can activate access to your Ping Identity account. If you do not activate access within 48 hours, your information will be automatically deleted.
2.)    WE ID:
To ensure that no third parties gain access to your data, you will be asked in a second step to provide further key data about your company. This information is marked with an asterisk as a mandatory field. These details are the company name, the country in which the company is based, the company address, and the business areas of Würth Elektronik that are relevant to you. With the help of this information, your customer account will be linked to the correct ERP customer accounts or new customer accounts will be created in the ERP systems.
In the course of your registration, the responsible Würth Elektronik office staff will receive a corresponding notification of your registration with the relevant details. In the case of an existing business relationship, this data is used to assign you to existing ERP customer accounts. If there is no business relationship, this information is used to create a new ERP customer account.
The aim of our service offering is to be able to provide you with the widest possible range of products and services in the electronics industry by utilizing synergies within Würth Elektronik. The legal basis for this data processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR / § 25(1) TDDDG. Another legal basis is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR / § 25(2) TDDDG. Registration is therefore necessary either to fulfill a contract with you or to carry out pre-contractual measures. We would like to point out that we always observe the need-to-know principle, which states that only those who actually need to be able to do so in order to perform their tasks can view the data you have provided.
You can use your email address and password to log in to a WE service at any time. The legal basis for this data processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR / § 25(1) TDDDG. A further legal basis is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR / § 25(2) TDDDG.
You also have the right to withdraw your consent(s) at any time; Art. 7 para. 3 sent. 1 GDPR. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; Art. 7 para. 3 sent. 2 GDPR.
In your WE ID account, you have the option of requesting changes and corrections to your data. You can also adjust your preferences accordingly or view your previous history (e.g. orders).
With your registration, you also agree to the newsletter dispatch. The legal basis for this is your active and voluntary consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time without giving reasons, in accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR. You can revoke this at any time directly in the newsletters. Of course, such a revocation has no negative effects on the use of your WE ID account.
Effective from 07.08.2024:
Furthermore, we would like to inform you that for the purpose of fulfilling the contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, we carry out statistical analyses and reach measurements during your visit to MyWE. The associated data processing, which is an essential part of using MyWE, is necessary to continue providing the platform to you free of charge.
Of course, you can also cancel or delete your registration or your WE ID account. In this case, we will delete your personal data immediately, provided that we are no longer entitled to retain the data due to contractual obligations [(Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR / § 25(2) TDDDG)] or legal obligations [(Art. 6(1)(1)(c) GDPR)] or due to our legitimate interests [(Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR / § 25(2) TDDDG)], in particular for the defense of legal claims.
d. REDEXPERT
Within the scope of your registration on our REDEXPERT portal, we will send you an e-mail requesting you to confirm that you actually want to open a user account. You can activate your user account by clicking the confirmation link contained in the e-mail. If you do not activate your user account within 48 hours, your information will be automatically deleted.
With regard to further aspects of registering with REDEXPERT, we request you to look in Section 4.c. “Opening and managing a Würth Elektronik user account”.
There is also a “Contact” button on our website. Clicking this button automatically opens an e-mail window in which the e-mail address of the REDEXPERT team:

is entered. We will process your personal data provided in the e-mail solely for the purpose of processing your request (Art. 6(1)(a, b) GDPR).
e. Live Support
On our websites, you have the option to contact us directly via “Live Support”. For our “Live Support”, we use “Userlike”, a live chat software from Userlike UG (limited liability), Probsteigasse 44-46, 50670 Cologne, Germany. Userlike uses cookies to enable a personal conversation in the form of a real-time chat with you on the website. Besides technical details about the messenger status, the cookie contains IDs so we can recognize users with whom we have already had contact via the chat. You can find out more about the cookies set by Userlike UG by clicking on the gear-icon, which is always located at the bottom left of all pages of our Internet presence.
When you send us a chat request, in addition to the data described in the Section 3.a. we also process and store the URL from which you accessed Live Support, the subject of your request, a transcript of the conversation with you, the date and duration of the chat, the processing status of your chat request, and the number of your page views and visits. You also have the option of providing us with your name, location, e-mail address, as well as other personal data. These data are stored by us and retained for six months. We process these data to allow us to address you personally in the course of the chat and to improve our service quality. After completing the chat request, you have the opportunity to rate and comment on the service quality. These voluntary data are also stored by us.
The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR, which allows the processing of personal data within the scope of our legitimate interests, unless your fundamental rights, freedoms or interests prevail. Our legitimate interests are to provide you with a live chat, to answer your request in a purposeful and personalized way, and to be able to analyze the use of our live chat for quality assurance purposes. In addition, we store the data stated in Section 3.a. in conjunction with a specific chat request to ensure IT security and to analyze and combat attacks.
If you would like to use Live Support outside of business hours, you will be automatically redirected to a form on which you can submit your concern. Our Live Support staff will get back to you as soon as possible. Processing your personal data in the context of this contact form is subject to the notes in Section 4.a.
5. Recipients of personal data
The personal data collected by us in the course of the visit and purely informational use of our Website (see Section 3) and also the personal data collected by us in the context of using certain functions and offers on our Website (see Section 4)  are in principle not disclosed or sent in any other way to other recipients.

They are contractually obliged to strictly comply with this Privacy Policy, the applicable statutory data protection provisions and our instructions (so-called “order processors” pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR).

At the end of these storage periods or upon your legitimate request for deletion, we will check whether certain personal data are still required for (other) legitimate purposes and, if not, whether contractual or statutory retention periods prevent the personal data from being deleted. In these cases, the personal data affected will be stored for as long as necessary to fulfill this (other) legitimate purpose, or for the duration of the respective contractual or legal retention period for these purposes. For other purposes, however, the data are blocked and then finally deleted at the end of the last contractual or legal retention period.

The session cookies we use are deleted when your browser is closed. The permanent cookies we set remain stored on your terminal device until their prescribed lifetime has expired or they are removed manually.
