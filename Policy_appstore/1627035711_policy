3. Who may Afterverse share Personal Data with?
Afterverse may work together with other companies in various activities, including for the hosting of Personal Data, analytics, and sending communications to offer the best game possible. We will always adopt, whenever possible, mechanisms for the anonymization of Personal Data, protecting the privacy of the users to the maximum. Thus, we reserve the right to share Personal Data only with the companies listed below:
Supplier Companies:
we employ other companies to perform work on our behalf and we need to share your Data with them to provide the XD RP. For example, we use data hosting services to store our database and share your information with technology providers. Our supplier companies are only authorized to use Personal Data for the specific purposes for which they were contracted and, therefore, will not use your Personal Data for purposes other than the provision of services contracted.

Analytics:
The Personal Data stored by Afterverse may be used for statistics (analytics), with the purpose of Afterverse understanding how users interact with the App. These Personal Data are pseudonymized and do not identify or make identifiable the holders of Personal Data, but only aim to better understand how the App is used, in order to improve the products and services offered and direct them to the interest of the user.
https://policies.playxdrp.com/en/partners/3.0
Marketing and sending communications:

Users and their legal representatives have the right to know if their data is shared, so Afterverse has separated this section of the policy to provide adequate transparency. Afterverse does not sell the personal data of its users to any third party.
4. Does Afterverse carry out international transfer of Personal Data?
Yes. Although Afterverse is based in Brazil and its products and services are intended for people located in Brazil, therefore applying Brazilian laws related to the protection of Personal Data, the Personal Data we collect may be transferred to the United States of America and/or European Union countries. This transfer occurs mainly for cloud hosting purposes of Afterverse's servers.
These companies can be identified at this link
https://policies.playxdrp.com/en/partners/3.0
. We recommend that you read carefully the privacy policies of these supplier and business partner companies, which may identify the exact location of their headquarters and servers.
By providing Personal Data to Afterverse, the user or their parent, guardian, or legal representative, agrees to the processing and international transfer of the Personal Data mentioned in this Policy to the United States of America and/or European Union countries. These Personal Data may be subject to local legislation and relevant rules.
5. What are the rights of the users as holders of Personal Data?
The user may choose not to disclose their Personal Data to Afterverse, but these Personal Data may be necessary for them to enjoy some of the features of XD RP. Regardless of this, the user always has rights related to privacy and the protection of their Personal Data. Afterverse cares about the security of these Personal Data and that the users have access and knowledge of all rights related to the processing of their Personal Data.In this sense, we expose below a brief explanation and examples about some of these rights:
Request for confirmation of the existence of processing: This right allows the user to request and receive confirmation about the existence of processing of their Personal Data.
Request for access to Personal Data: This right allows the user to request and receive a copy of the Personal Data that are processed by Afterverse. For your privacy and security, we will adopt reasonable measures to verify your identity, such as, for example, requiring login before granting access to your Personal Data.
Request for correction of incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated data: This right allows the user, at any time, to request the correction and/or rectification of Personal Data, in case they identify that some of them are incorrect. However, for this correction to be effected, Afterverse will need to check the validity of the Personal Data provided.
Request for anonymization, blocking, or deletion of unnecessary, excessive Personal Data or processed in non-compliance with the legislation: This right allows for the request of the anonymization, blocking, or deletion of Personal Data from Afterverse's database. All Personal Data collected will be anonymized, blocked, or deleted from the servers when so requested or when they are no longer necessary or relevant for the offering of services, except if there is any other reason for its maintenance, such as a possible need to retain Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation for safeguarding Afterverse's rights.
Request for portability: Afterverse allows the user or third parties designated by them to obtain access to the Personal Data processed by Afterverse in a structured and interoperable format.
Right not to provide or withdraw consent at any time: The user has the right not to provide or withdraw their consent, however, this will not affect the legality of any processing previously done based on the consent given. If the user does not provide or withdraw their consent, maybe Afterverse cannot provide certain products and services, essential to the usability of the App or not. If this is the case, Afterverse will inform the user when this happens, for clarification purposes for the user's informed decision-making.
Right to review automated decisions: The user also has the right to request the review of decisions made solely based on automated processing of Personal Data that affect the interests of the users. Currently, Afterverse does not make any decisions that are exclusively automated.
Right to object to certain processing of Personal Data: The user also has the right to object to certain processing purposes. In some cases, Afterverse may demonstrate that it has legitimate reasons to process the data, which override the user's rights. For example: if the personal data are essential for the functionality of the products or services.
It may be necessary to request specific information from the user, or their parent, guardian, or legal representative, to confirm their identity and ensure the right to access their Personal Data (or to exercise their other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that the data is not disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive them.
Afterverse will try to respond to all legitimate requests within 15 (fifteen) business days. Occasionally, it may take longer than 15 (fifteen) business days if the request is particularly complex or if the user has made several requests. In this case, we will notify the data subject and keep them updated on the progress of the request.
If there are any doubts about the subject and about how the user can exercise their rights, Afterverse provides the following contact channel:
https://policies.playxdrp.com/privacy
.
6. How long will the Personal Data of the users be stored?
Afterverse will keep the Personal Data of the users only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it collects them, including for the purposes of complying with any legal obligations (such as the storage of access records to the application for 6 months, as per the Civil Rights Framework for the Internet), contractual obligations, accountability, or requests from competent authorities.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, Afterverse considers the applicable legal requirements, the amount, the nature, and the sensitivity of such data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purpose of processing and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
Anyway, if you have registered an account on XD RP, the information of your account will be kept while you maintain this account active. Your account and the information related to it will be deleted if you do not log in for 5 (five) years. If you request the deletion of your data and/or your account, Afterverse will still keep the data for 15 (fifteen) days after your deletion request in case of withdrawal of the request.
It is important to highlight that Afterverse may keep Personal Data for a period longer than indicated above to meet legal obligations that may be applicable, as provided by relevant legislation and consumer and tax laws.
7. How does Afterverse protect the data of the users?
Afterverse adopts technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data of the users against loss, unauthorized use, or other abuses. Personal Data are stored in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to the public.
Afterverse strives to protect the privacy of the account and the Personal Data of the users it maintains in its records. We maintain procedural, technical, and physical safeguards that help us prevent loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the Personal Data provided by the users. However, it is not guaranteed that a transmission of Personal Data carried out via the Internet is completely secure. It is possible that third parties, unaffiliated with Afterverse and not under our control, intercept or have access to transmissions or Personal Data in an illegal manner. Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee the complete security of Personal Data transmitted to our site or App, we ask for your cooperation to help us maintain a safe environment for everyone. In addition to adopting good security practices regarding the account and Data, be careful and attentive with the way of transmission and with the choice of Personal Data that are shared with us.
