Visa Global Privacy Notice
Effective date:
August 20, 2024
This Global Privacy Notice explains how Visa and its Affiliates¹ collect, use, and share Personal Information when you use our, or our clients’, products, services, offers, and promotions.
As a global payments technology company, Visa fulfills many roles. When we act on behalf of our Visa clients, we only collect, use, and share Personal Information as authorized by our contracts with our clients. If you have questions about how these companies handle your Personal Information, or wish to exercise your rights, please contact them directly. For example, if you have questions about your Visa card transactions, please contact the institution that issued your card for more information.
Where Visa acts a controller under applicable laws and collects information directly from an individual, the controller is the Visa entity listed on the terms and conditions you sign when enrolling in a Visa service, product, or offer. Some Visa companies and services have different privacy notices that are provided when you use them. We also have supplemental privacy notices that provide additional information as required by law.
You can learn more and exercise your privacy choices under relevant laws at our
Privacy Rights Portal.

Visa’s Affiliates are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by Visa U.S.A. Inc. or its parent company Visa Inc. through ownership—for example, Visa International Service Association, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Canada Corporation, Visa International Servicios de Pago España, S.R.L.,Visa Europe Limited, Visa do Brasil Empreendimentos Ltda, CardinalCommerce Corporation, CyberSource Corporation, and Verifi, Inc.

Online Privacy
When you visit our website, use our mobile applications, or engage with our emails and online ads, we may collect information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs, and web beacons.
In some cases, the information we collect is only used in a non-identifiable way. For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns. We do not use this information to profile you or target our ads.
In other cases, we may use the information in an identifiable way. For example, we may authenticate you or your device, deliver personalized content or use the information for analytics, fraud detection, and security. We may also use the information for online ad targeting. Our
Cookie Notice
provides more information about our online data collection technologies and your choices.
As described in our
Cookie Notice
, we have relationships with third-party advertising companies. These third parties may track you, your browser or your device across different websites and applications.
Subject to your settings, we may place cookies or tags on your computer when you visit our website so that they can display targeted advertisements to you on other websites. The use of your data by these companies is subject to their own privacy policies.
Many Visa websites only place marketing, personalization, and advertising cookies if you explicitly accept these cookies by clicking “Accept All Cookies” when you first visit the website. Our
Cookie Notice
explains how to manage your preferences and how to disable previously accepted cookies.
Our websites may enable you to interact with us and others via social media platforms. We collect information from these platforms as permitted by the sites’ legal terms. We may also display interest-based ads to you when you are using these platforms. The platforms allow us to personalize the ads that we display to you, and they may gain insights about individuals who respond to the ads we serve.
Mobile Applications

We may also offer automatic ("push") notifications. We will provide push notifications only if you opt-in to receive them. You do not have to provide location information or enable push notifications to use our mobile apps.
Certain mobile applications controlled by Visa may allow us to share data with advertising platforms for purposes of showing you interest-based ads. We rely on the mobile network operators’ settings to allow you to opt into this type of sharing when you download our applications. However, where able, we will also provide you choices within the account profile section of the application.
We collect device identifiers and other device-related information, including your device’s advertising ID, if available. This information is used to identify your device and authenticate you. We may also use device-related information to associate you with different devices that you may use, including for fraud-protection purposes and to better target advertising. In many cases, you can reset your device’s advertising ID. Both Android and iOS devices enable you to reset your device identifier under the “settings” menu.

We respect your rights to access, correct and delete your information in accordance with applicable laws. If you have an online account with Visa, you can log into your account to access, update, and delete your information. You can also submit requests under relevant laws to us via the
Privacy Rights Portal

For security reasons and to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information, cardholders should contact their payment card issuers to access their relevant information. This helps ensure that access to the information is only provided to the authorized individuals, subject to the issuer’s verification processes.Additionally, if you have questions about how your issuer, merchants, or rewards networks handle your Personal Information, please check the privacy notices provided by these companies and contact them directly for assistance with any privacy requests.

Your Privacy Rights
US Social Security Statement Page
Your Privacy Rights
Effective date:
October 7, 2024
U.S. State Privacy Laws Supplementary Notice
This supplemental privacy notice only applies to residents of certain U.S. States whose information is processed pursuant to applicable U.S. State law privacy requirements, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, “CCPA”) and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Rights Act (“OCPA”) (collectively, “State Privacy Laws”).
At Visa, we are committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of all the Personal Information that is entrusted to us. Visa has a Global Privacy Program to help ensure your information is handled properly, and your Personal Information is protected. It also reflects the requirements of the privacy laws in all the countries and states where Visa operates.
In the United States, payment transaction and other information Visa processes in connection with operating its electronic payments networks often is regulated by existing federal financial privacy laws. State Privacy Laws recognize that, where such financial information is already protected by federal privacy law, these State Privacy Laws do not apply to this information. Visa’s privacy program reflects the sensitivity of the financial and other information we handle. If you have questions about how we handle your data, please review the
Visa Global Privacy Notice
.
Visa also processes certain information that is subject to State Privacy Laws. State Privacy Laws may apply (1) to our marketing data, which we collect when consumers sign up for marketing from Visa, attend Visa-sponsored events, participate in surveys, or interact with our websites and apps, and (2) to information collected from individuals who use our Visa-branded products, for example click-to-pay or Visa Payment Passkey Services. This supplemental privacy notice explains our practices for this State Privacy Law-covered information.
For information that Visa collects subject to State Privacy Laws, the
Visa Global Privacy Notice
describes the categories of Personal Information that we may have collected or disclosed for business purposes in the past 12 months, the sources of the Personal Information, the business or commercial purposes for which we use or disclose the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose the information for business purposes.
Visa retains the Personal Information it has collected as long as the information is needed for the purposes set for in the
Visa Global Privacy Notice
and this U.S. State Privacy Laws supplement, and for any additional period that may be required or permitted by law. The length of time your Personal Information is retained depends on the purpose(s) for which it was collected, how it is used, and the requirements to comply with applicable laws.
State Privacy Laws provide their residents with specific privacy rights, including the right to correct inaccurate Personal Information, delete Personal Information, and access Personal Information and other information about our Personal Information processing practices, including in a portable format. Some State Privacy Laws may also give their residents the right to appeal our decisions with respect to your privacy rights requests. As described further in the sections below, State Privacy Laws may also give their residents the right to opt-out of having their Personal Information sold, processed for targeted advertising purposes¹, or used for profiling in certain contexts, as well as certain rights in relation to the processing of their sensitive Personal Information. Finally, State Privacy Laws may give their residents the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of any of these privacy rights.
¹ Personal Information of children under 16 cannot be sold or processed for targeted or cross-context behavioral advertising purposes without affirmative consent. Visa does not knowingly sell or process children’s information for these purposes.
The right to opt out of sale of Personal Information
Some State Privacy Laws provide you with the right to opt out of the “sale” of your Personal Information. Visa does not sell Personal Information for money, although our websites and applications may use cookies or similar technologies as described below. Our Global Privacy Notice describes how we disclose information to third parties, such as when we process payments, provide services to your card issuer, prevent fraud, or otherwise share information with your consent.
The right to opt out of the processing of Personal Information for certain advertising purposes
Some State Privacy Laws provide you with the right to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of serving you advertisements that are relevant to you based on your activity across our services and other sites (“targeted advertising” or “cross-contextual behavioral advertising”), including the sharing of your Personal Information for these targeted advertising purposes.
Like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you, and our websites and applications may use cookies or similar technologies that allow advertising partners to collect your Personal Information for their use. On most Visa websites, Visa only permits advertising partners to collect your Personal Information in this manner with your consent. To request to opt-in (or to change your mind after opting-in), please visit the
Cookie Preference Center
or visit the
Cookie Policy link
in the footer of this site.
Please note that some transfers of your Personal Information may not be for purposes of targeted advertising,  and certain exemptions may apply under applicable State Privacy Laws. Your choices do not affect other disclosures of your information, as outlined in our Global Privacy Notice, such as when we process payments, provide services to your card issuer, or prevent fraud.
Sensitive Personal Information rights
In the United States, the payment transaction and certain other information that Visa collects when it operates its payment networks is regulated by existing federal financial privacy laws. Further, any sensitive Personal Information subject to the applicable State Privacy Law is only processed for purposes under the applicable law which do not require your consent or for which you do not have a right to limit.
Access, correction, deletion, and appeal rights
You may exercise your rights, authorize another person to act on your behalf, or appeal a denial of a request by:
Visiting our
Privacy Rights Page
Calling Visa at 1-844-909-1620
Emailing us at
privacy@visa.com
Please do not include sensitive information, such as your account number, in emails.
Mailing us a letter:
Visa Global Privacy Office
900 Metro Center Blvd.
Foster City, CA, 94404
Please note that we will need to verify your identity before we can fulfill your State Privacy Law-related request. Because the information that we maintain that is subject to State Privacy Laws generally consists of marketing information, we will generally verify your identity using your email address. Where possible, we will respond to requests using the email address that is associated with the information we maintain.
If you would like to designate an agent, please send an email from your own email address to
privacy@visa.com
indicating the name and email address of your agent. We will respond to that’s person’s requests using both your email address and the agent’s email address.
Please understand that your rights are subject to some limitations, such as:
For security reasons and to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information, cardholders should contact their payment card issuers to access their information. This helps ensure that access to the information is only provided to the authorized individuals, subject to the issuer’s verification processes.
State Privacy Laws contemplate that service providers should refer access and deletion requests to the companies with whom the individual has the direct relationship. In many cases, we act as a service provider for card issuers and merchants, including rewards networks. If you have questions about how your issuer or a rewards network handles your Personal Information, please check the privacy notices provided by these companies and contact them directly for assistance with your relevant privacy requests.
Some State Privacy Laws may also prohibit companies from including certain elements of sensitive Personal Information, such as payment card number, in their access reports, even if you have provided those data elements to use for marketing.
If you request that we delete your Personal Information, we will do so except in those situations where our retention is permitted by the applicable State Privacy Laws (such as for fraud prevention or legal compliance, or where reasonably necessary to provide the services requested by the consumer or for our internal business purposes). In these situations, we will retain your information in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.
If you have any other questions or requests, please contact us at
privacy@visa.com
.
Financial Incentives
Visa provides loyalty and other similar promotional programs in order to reward and thank loyal customers for using the Visa payment network and other Visa services. You can opt into these programs through the mechanisms described when they are offered to you, such as via email. Visa collects and uses Personal Information, such as Contact Information, in order to provide these programs. Visa does not assign monetary value for the information we collect through these programs when sending email communications. Based on our reasonable and good faith estimate, we receive value from these programs in increased loyalty and purchases.
You may opt-out of receiving commercial email communications at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included within any commercial email we send you.
You also can opt-out of loyalty and similar programs at any time by using the mechanisms described to you in relevant program terms and conditions. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under applicable State Privacy Laws. However, if you ask us to delete your information, you will not be able to receive additional offers or promotions for which the deleted information was needed for program participation. Where possible, offers or promotions sent to you previously will continue to be honored according to their original terms.
Additional Disclosures for Large Businesses
The CCPA requires certain businesses to compile and disclose information each year regarding their compliance with the CCPA for the previous twelve-month period. Visa has elected to provide these reports annually for the preceding calendar year 2023.

Visa U.S. End User Open Banking Privacy Notice
Effective date: January 31, 2024
Visa values your trust and respects your privacy. This U.S. Open Banking Privacy Notice (“
Privacy Notice
”) explains how Tink U.S. Inc and its Affiliate¹ company Visa. (“
Visa
”, “
we
,” and/or “
us
”) collects, uses, and shares your Personal Information when you use our Open Banking Services (as defined below), and related services that link to this Privacy Notice. To learn more about how Visa collects, uses and shares Personal Information please review the
Visa Global Privacy Notice
and visit the
Visa Privacy Center

About our Open Banking Services
Visa’s open banking platform enables our business customers (“
Providers
”) to build services that leverage individuals’ (“
End Users
” or “
you
”) financial information.
We provide account information services, payment initiation services, and other related open banking solutions (“
Open Banking Service
s”) to End Users and Providers, which allow End Users to share their financial information with Providers or to make payments.
When you request services from a Provider, the Provider will redirect you to Visa’s open banking platform, where we can collect your financial information or initiate a payment on your behalf. Once this process is concluded, you are redirected back to the Provider.
Scope of this Privacy Notice
We fulfill many roles when providing our Open Banking Services.
When we provide Open Banking Services directly to End Users, End Users will sign up to Visa’s Open Banking Terms and Conditions. In this scenario, this Privacy Notice applies to the collection, use and sharing of End Users’ Personal information that Visa processes in connection with the provision of the Open Banking Services.
When we act on behalf of Providers, we only collect, use, and share Personal Information as authorized by contracts with Providers. In this scenario, the privacy notice provided by the Provider with which the End User has a relationship will apply. This Privacy Notice does not cover what others – such as Providers or other service providers, websites and applications – do with your Personal Information. If you have questions about how those companies handle your Personal Information, or wish to exercise your rights, please contact them directly.
This Privacy Notice also does not cover Personal Information we collect through our website, or when you interact with our websites. Please read the privacy notices published on our websites or otherwise provided to you when you interact directly with Visa.
In this Privacy Notice, “
Personal Information
” refers to information that (alone or when used in combination with other information) is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be associated with an individual. Personal Information, sometimes referred to as “personal data”, may also have specific meanings under different privacy laws.
