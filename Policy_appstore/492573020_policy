What we do not collect, and you should not be asked by Potential Employers to provide to HireVue, are things like protected health information, financial information, date of birth, social security or other government-issued identification number, and other sensitive personal information.
It is primarily the Potential Employer who must ensure that your personal information is collected and processed in accordance with data protection laws.

The following outlines the types of personal information that we will typically collect through the Services on behalf of our customers:
Information that you provide voluntarily
In using the Services, Candidates and Employees may be required to provide certain personal information about themselves – for example, their name, contact details, username and password (username and password is for Employees only, as Candidates do not create accounts within the HireVue platform), and other information as requested by the Potential Employer. Candidates may complete a job interview through the Services which can include information such as work history, skills, experience, abilities, work style and other responses to questions, as well as submissions through a variety of types of media including video/audio interviews, coding challenges, training exercises and the like.
Information that we collect automatically
When you use the Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area and the UK, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. Specifically, this information may include IP addresses, other unique device IDs or addresses, web browser and/or device type, the pages you view on the Services and the dates and times you visit, access or use the Service.
Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology” below. You can view our full cookie policy

Information that we collect automatically
From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources, but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.
^ back to top
How does HireVue use this information?
HireVue may use your personal information in a variety of ways for the operation of the Website and its Services, including:
To operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Website and Services, to personalise the Website and Services for your preferences and interests.
To contact you for administrative purposes regarding the Services, for customer service purposes, or regarding content that you have posted to the Service.
To understand and analyse the usage trends, interests, and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Website and Services works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
HireVue may now or in the future use “automatically collected” information and “cookies” information to: (a) personalise our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website or Services; (b) monitor and analyse the effectiveness of the application and evaluation activities; (c) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of users, pages and media and features of the Website or Service accessed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, and status, including the ways in which you may interact with the Services.
Where it is in accordance with your preferences, to send emails related to the products and services we think you may be interested in. You will have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages, or by updating your account preferences through the Services.
^ back to top
Who does HireVue share my personal information with?
We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
to the Potential Employer;
to our
group companies, third party services providers and partners
who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security and features of our Website and Services), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information;
to any
competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party
where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;
in connection with any proposed purchase, reorganisation, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;
to any
other person with your consent
to the disclosure.
As stated above, if you are a Candidate or Employee and we are collecting your personal information through the Services, we will be collecting it on behalf of our customers, in accordance with the agreements that we have with them. For further information about how your personal information is shared with third parties, you should contact the relevant Potential Employer or refer to that Potential Employer’s Privacy Policy/Privacy Notice.
^ back to top
Legal basis for processing personal information of Website visitors (EEA visitors only)
If you are a Website visitor from the European Economic Area or the UK, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, to perform a contract with the Potential Employer as a service provider/data processor, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), which are not already referred to above, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading
below
.

Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “
Cookies
“) to collect and use personal information about you, including to help us understand how our Website and Services are being used or to personalise our Website and Services for you.

How does HireVue keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please be aware that no physical or technical system is completely secure or immune from outages, losses, attacks, circumvention, design or implementation flaws, and human error. Therefore, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant that information you transmit to HireVue will not be lost or compromised, either during or after transmission.
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times, to the extent your access includes an account and password (Candidates do not have an account and password when using the Services).
^ back to top
International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, unless otherwise required by local law, our Website and Services are hosted in the USA and the EEA. Also, your personal information may be transferred to and processed in other countries around the world where our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate including in the USA, the UK, the European Union/European Economic Area, India, and Australia. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these locations.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws. If you are from the EEA or the UK, these include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, and with our third-party service providers and partners. The Standard Contractual Clauses require non-EEA companies to protect EEA and UK personal information they process in accordance with European Economic Area data protection law.
For transfers from the EU, UK and Switzerland to the United States, HireVue complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S.
DPF
), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S.
DPF
, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S.
DPF
) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. For further information, please see our “
Data Privacy Framework Self-Certification Notice
”.
^ back to top
Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Where we are collecting personal information on behalf of our customers (Potential Employers), we will retain the personal information in accordance with our services agreements with them and their instructions.
^ back to top
Your data protection rights
Under applicable data protection laws, you have the following data protection rights in respect of your personal information collected through the Website:
If you wish to
access, correct, update or request deletion
of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading
below
.
In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you can
object to processing
of your personal information, ask us to
restrict processing
of your personal information or
request portability
of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading
below
.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can
withdraw your consent
at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the
right to complain to a data protection authority
about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available
here
.)
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals whose information was collected through using this Website wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.

Legal basis for processing personal information of Website visitors (EEA visitors only)
If you are a Website visitor from the European Economic Area or the UK, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, to perform a contract with the Potential Employer as a service provider/data processor, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), which are not already referred to above, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading
below

How does HireVue keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please be aware that no physical or technical system is completely secure or immune from outages, losses, attacks, circumvention, design or implementation flaws, and human error. Therefore, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant that information you transmit to HireVue will not be lost or compromised, either during or after transmission.

International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, unless otherwise required by local law, our Website and Services are hosted in the USA and the EEA. Also, your personal information may be transferred to and processed in other countries around the world where our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate including in the USA, the UK, the European Union/European Economic Area, India, and Australia. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these locations.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws. If you are from the EEA or the UK, these include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, and with our third-party service providers and partners. The Standard Contractual Clauses require non-EEA companies to protect EEA and UK personal information they process in accordance with European Economic Area data protection law.
For transfers from the EU, UK and Switzerland to the United States, HireVue complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S.
DPF
), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S.
DPF
, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S.
DPF
) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. For further information, please see our “
Data Privacy Framework Self-Certification Notice
”.

Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Where we are collecting personal information on behalf of our customers (Potential Employers), we will retain the personal information in accordance with our services agreements with them and their instructions.

.
In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you can

below
.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can
withdraw your consent
at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the
right to complain to a data protection authority
about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
