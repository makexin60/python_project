For information about how Third-Party Platforms handle personal data and use cookies and other technologies, consult their respective privacy policies and relevant product documentation.
Visitor Cookie settings
Most browsers will let Messenger or Help Center visitors reject and clear Cookies in their browser settings.  Applicable laws in some jurisdictions may require Customers to inform visitors as to the nature of the Cookies utilized by their Intercom Services, and in certain circumstances, obtain visitors’ prior consent to the placement and/or use of those Cookies.  If visitors elect not to activate certain Cookies, certain visitor-facing and Customer-facing features of the Services may not function.
