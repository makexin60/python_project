Dash Wallet
Dash Wallet
(breadwallet fork) is a real standalone
Dash
client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access your money.
Using
SPV
mode,
Dash Wallet
connects directly to the Dash network with the fast performance you need on a mobile device.
Dash Wallet
is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes, even physical theft. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing,
keychain and code signatures,
Dash Wallet
represents a significant security advantage over web and desktop wallets, and other mobile platforms.
Simplicity is
Dash Wallet
’s core design principle. A simple backup phrase is all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or broken.
Because
Dash Wallet
is
deterministic
, your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup phrase.

DashPay Requirements
Currently, DashPay wallet is under active development so it requires a few additional steps to make it work.

DashSync
and
dapi-grpc
repositories:
git clone https://github.com/dashevo/dashsync-iOS.git DashSync
git clone https://github.com/dashevo/dapi-grpc.git dapi-grpc
To simplify developing process we use local podspec dependencies and it's important to preserve the following folder structure:
../DashSync/
../dapi-grpc/
../dashwallet-ios/
Install protobuf and grpc:
brew install protobuf grpc
Install last version of rust:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
