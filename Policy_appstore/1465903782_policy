Google Translation API
: A service that enables automatic translation of text from one language to another, provided by Google Inc.
Microsoft Translation API
: A service that enables automatic translation of text from one language to another, provided by Microsoft Corporation.
Once the translation is complete, the response is delivered to your app. We do not store your texts or translations on our servers after
  processing, ensuring that your data remains secure and private.
Data retention period
We understand the importance of keeping your personal data safe and retaining it only for as long as necessary.
  We have detailed how long we will keep your personal data for a specific purpose in the “Details of Processing” section.
Please note that there may be occasions when we are required to retain your personal data for longer than initially stated.
  This may include, but is not limited to, situations involving legal proceedings, investigations, or government inquiries.
  We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to comply with these legal obligations, and we will take
  appropriate measures to ensure its security and confidentiality during this period.
We regularly review our data retention practices to ensure that we keep only the personal data we need and that it is kept securely.

We neither use automated decision-making nor rely on automated profiling.
Sharing of your personal data with third parties
We value your privacy and care about the security of your data. Sometimes we need to share some information with other companies.
  Here’s why:
Compliance with applicable law.
We make every effort to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and legal obligations. In certain instances,
  we may need to disclose your personal data to comply with legal requirements, such as responding to subpoenas, court orders,
  or other lawful government requests. In addition, we may disclose your personal data if we believe in good faith that such
  disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, enforce our Terms and Conditions and End User Licence Agreements, investigate fraud,
  or protect your safety.
Achieving purposes of processing.
We also partner with certain trusted companies to provide you with the best experience while using our App. These partners may include
  hosting service providers, payment processors, analytics platforms, and others. We share only the necessary information with them
  to help them perform their functions, such as processing payments or analyzing the use of our App. We choose our partners carefully
  and require them to adhere to high standards of data protection.
We always strive to be as open and transparent as possible regarding the processing of your personal data. If you have any questions
  or concerns about the transfer of your personal data to third parties, please do not hesitate to contact us for more information.
We may engage the following third parties in the processing of personal data:

If you are a
California resident
, you have certain rights under the CCPA and other applicable laws regarding the collection,
  use, disclosure, and sale of your personal data. This section of our Privacy Policy outlines those rights and explains how you can
  exercise them:
Right to know
California residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal data that we have collected
        about them, the categories of sources from which the personal data was collected, the purposes for which the personal data was collected,
        and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared the personal data.
Upon receiving and verifying your request, we will promptly provide you with the requested information for the 12-month period preceding
        your request, free of charge, unless an exception applies.
Right to delete
California residents have the right to request the deletion of the personal data that we have collected, subject to certain exceptions
        as permitted by applicable law.
Upon receiving and verifying your request, we will delete your personal data from our records and direct our App providers to do the same,
        unless an exception applies.
Right to opt-out
California residents have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Sale is defined broadly in the CCPA to include
        “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise communicating” the personal data
        of California residents.
Please note that we do not, and will not, provide your personal data in direct exchange for money. Therefore, in the literal sense,
        we do not sell your personal data. However, we have disclosed some categories of personal data we collect to third parties for business
        purposes as explained under “
Details of processing
”.
To the extent that this practice is construed as a “sale” under the CCPA, we will exercise your right to refuse to make a sale in the
        event that you request us to.
Right to non-discrimination
California residents have the right to non-discrimination, under which we cannot refuse to provide goods or services, charge you a different
        price, or provide goods or services of a different level or quality just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA.
We will not deny services, charge different prices, or provide a different level or quality of services based on your exercise of CCPA rights.
Right to correct
California residents have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate personal data that we have about them.
Upon receiving and verifying your request, we will promptly review your personal data and make corrections as appropriate, ensuring that
        it is accurate and complete.
Right to limit
California residents have the right to direct us to only use their sensitive personal data (for example, a social security number,
        financial account information, precise geolocation data, or genetic data) for limited purposes, such as providing the services
        they requested.
We do not process such sensitive personal data.
If you want to exercise your rights as described above, please contact us via the email address provided in the
  “
Contact details of the data controller
” section. According to CCPA regulations, we need to verify your identity before
  proceeding with your request. To verify your identity, you may need to log in to your account. If you do not have an account, we will attempt
  to match the information you provide with what we have on file. In some cases, we may refuse the request if we cannot verify your identity,
  such as if you have asked us to delete your personal data.
Under CCPA requirements, we aim to respond to a verifiable request within 45 days of receiving it. If we need more time (up to 90 days),
  we will notify you in writing of the reason and the extension period. Our written response will be sent via email.
If you have any concerns about how we handle your personal data, please inform us, and we will review your feedback. If you are not satisfied
  with our response to your complaint, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant authority.
Age limits
We do not knowingly collect or request personal data from individuals under the age of 18, nor do we allow such individuals to use AR Translator.
  If you are under 18, please refrain from providing us with any personal data. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected
  personal data from someone under 18, we will promptly delete it. If you believe that we may have personal data from or about someone under 18,
  please contact us using the provided information.

  party website, you will be redirected to that website. We recommend reviewing the privacy terms of each website you visit. We have no control
