On 6 April 2016, the European Union approved a major reform of the legal framework relating to the protection of personal data by adopting the "General Data Protection Regulation" (GDPR or Regulation), directly applicable in the Member States. The Regulation replaces Directive 95/46/EC ("Data Protection Directive") and its application becomes mandatory from 25 May 2018, two years after its entry into force.
The new Regulation reinforces the protection of the right to protection of personal data (Data Protection), in line with the recognition of the protection of personal data as a fundamental right of the EU. The Regulation also represents a necessary and urgent response to the challenges posed by technological developments that allows the collection and processing of large amounts of personal data in real time, allowing the development of automated decisions that go beyond human intervention. The Regulation meets the need to protect the private sphere increasingly felt by European citizens.
