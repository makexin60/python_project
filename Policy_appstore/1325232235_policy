On 6 April 2016, the European Union approved a major reform of the legal framework relating to the protection of personal data by adopting the "General Data Protection Regulation" (GDPR or Regulation), directly applicable in the Member States. The Regulation replaces Directive 95/46/EC ("Data Protection Directive") and its application becomes mandatory from 25 May 2018, two years after its entry into force.
The new Regulation reinforces the protection of the right to protection of personal data (Data Protection), in line with the recognition of the protection of personal data as a fundamental right of the EU. The Regulation also represents a necessary and urgent response to the challenges posed by technological developments that allows the collection and processing of large amounts of personal data in real time, allowing the development of automated decisions that go beyond human intervention. The Regulation meets the need to protect the private sphere increasingly felt by European citizens.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your

For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

11. Specific information about automated decision-making and profiling
“
Automated-decision making”
is the process of making a decision by fully automated means without human involvement. In some cases these decisions
could have a legal or similarly significant
effect on you as an individual. “
Profiling
” means analysis of an individual's personality, behaviour, interest and habits to make predictions or decisions about them. Where authorised under EU or Member State law or where necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract, we may in some cases use automated decision-making or profiling for decisions. An example of our use of automated decision making is evaluation of your creditworthiness to assess your suitability for certain credit products.
We believe that by making such decisions automatically, PayPal increases its objectivity and transparency in deciding which services to offer you. We deploy several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. You can always ask for a manual decision-making process instead, express your opinion or contest decision making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, if such a decision would produce
legal effects or otherwise similarly significantly affect you
. You can find out more about how to object to these decisions in Section 10
(“Your data protection rights”)
.
Contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO)
Online
if you require more information on our use of Automated-decision making or Profiling.
12. Why do we share your Personal Data with credit reference agencies?
If you have applied for or use our credit Services, in order to process your application, we may supply your Personal Data to credit reference agencies (CRAs) and they will give us information about you, such as your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity.
The legal bases for such transmissions are found in Article 6, paragraph 1, letter b (contractual) and Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f (legitimate interest) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”).
We will also continue to exchange information about you with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. This information may be supplied by CRAs to other organizations to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe.
Your data will also be linked to the data of any joint applicants or other financial associates.

16. Banking Regulations Notice for Users in the EEA and UK
In general, the Luxembourg laws to which PayPal’s handling of user data is subject (data protection and bank secrecy) require a higher degree of transparency than most other EU laws. This is why, unlike the vast majority of providers of internet-based services or financial services in the EU, PayPal has listed in this Privacy Statement the third party service providers and business partners to whom we may disclose your data, together with the purpose of disclosure and type of information disclosed. You will find a link to those third parties
here
. By accepting this Privacy Statement and maintaining an account with PayPal, you expressly agree to the transfer of your data to those third parties for the purposes listed.
PayPal may update the list of third parties referred to above on the first business day of every quarter (January, April, July and October). PayPal will only start transferring any data to any of the new entities or for the new purposes or data types indicated in each update after 30 days from the date when that list is made public through this Privacy Statement. You should review the list each quarter on the PayPal website on the dates stated above. If you do not object to the new data disclosure, within 30 days after the publication of the updated list of third parties, you are deemed to have accepted the changes to the list and to this Privacy Statement.

Stripe will provide you reasonable notice if the modification or discontinuation would materially reduce the functionality of a Service or Stripe Technology that you are using, unless giving notice would (i) pose a security issue to Stripe; or (ii) cause Stripe to violate Law or breach any legal obligation to a Governmental Authority or Financial Partner.

3.2 Information Stripe Obtains.
You authorize Stripe to obtain information about you and your business from Stripe’s service providers and other third parties, including credit reporting agencies, banking partners and information bureaus, for the purposes of this Agreement. This information may include your, or your representative’s, name, addresses, credit history, banking relationships, and financial history. You must authorize and direct those third parties to compile and provide this information to Stripe.
4. Services Fees; Taxes.
4.1 Services Fees.
The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page, unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing. Subject to the requirements of Law, Stripe may revise the Fees at any time. Stripe may, from time to time, offer a Service or Service feature without charge, or waive a Fee for that Service or Service feature. If Stripe increases a Fee, or introduces a new Fee, for a Service that you are currently using, then Stripe will notify you at least 30 days (or longer period if Law requires) before the revised or new Fee applies to you.
4.2 Collection of Fees and Other Amounts.
You must pay, or ensure that Stripe is able to collect, Fees, Taxes, and other amounts you owe under this Agreement when due. Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff Fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreements you have with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, from your Stripe Account balance, or invoice you for those amounts. If you fail to pay invoiced amounts when due, if your Stripe Account balance is negative or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, or if Stripe is unable to collect amounts due from your Stripe Account balance, then Stripe may, to the extent Law permits, deduct, recoup or setoff those amounts from: (a) if established and applicable, each Reserve; (b) funds payable by Stripe or its Affiliate to you or your Affiliate; (c) if established, each User Affiliate Reserve; (d) each User Bank Account; and (e) the Stripe account balance of each Stripe account that Stripe determines, acting reasonably, is associated with you or your Affiliate. If the currency of the amount being deducted is different from the currency of the amount you owe, Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff an amount equal to the amount owed (using Stripe’s conversion rate) together with any fees Stripe incurs in making the conversion.
4.3 Debit Authorization.
Without limiting Section 4.2 of these General Terms, you authorize Stripe to debit each User Bank Account without separate notice, and according to the applicable
User Bank Account Debit Authorization
, to collect amounts you owe under this Agreement. If Stripe is unable to collect those amounts by debiting a User Bank Account, then you immediately grant to Stripe a new, original authorization to debit each User Bank Account without notice and according to the applicable
User Bank Account Debit Authorization
. Stripe may rely on this authorization to make one or more attempts to collect all or a subset of the amounts owed. Your authorization under this Section 4.3 will remain in full force and effect until (a) all of your Stripe Accounts are closed; or (b) all fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement are paid, whichever occurs later. If applicable debit scheme authorization rules grant you the right to revoke your debit authorization, then to the extent Law permits, you waive that right.
4.4 Taxes.
The Fees exclude all Taxes, except as the Stripe Pricing Page expressly states to the contrary. You have sole responsibility and liability for:
(a) determining which, if any, Taxes or fees apply to the sale of your products and services, acceptance of donations, or payments you make or receive in connection with your use of the Services; and
(b) assessing, collecting, reporting and remitting Taxes for your business.
If Stripe is required by Law to collect or withhold any Taxes, Stripe may deduct those Taxes from amounts otherwise owed to you and pay those Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. If you are exempt from paying, or are otherwise eligible to pay a reduced rate on, those Taxes, you may provide to Stripe an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to your tax-exempt status or reduced rate eligibility, in which case Stripe will not deduct the Taxes that certificate covers. You must provide accurate information regarding your tax affairs as Stripe reasonably requests, and must promptly notify Stripe if any information that Stripe prepopulates is inaccurate or incomplete. Stripe may send documents to you and taxing authorities for transactions processed using the Services. Specifically, Law may require Stripe to file periodic informational returns with taxing authorities related to your use of the Services. Stripe may send tax-related information electronically to you.
5. User Bank Accounts; Funds.
5.1 User Bank Accounts; Prohibition on Grant or Assignment.
You must designate at least one User Bank Account in connection with the Services. Stripe may debit and credit a User Bank Account as described in this Agreement. You must not grant or assign to any third party any lien on or interest in funds that may be owed to you under this Agreement until the funds are deposited into a User Bank Account.
5.2 Holding of Funds.
To the extent Law and the applicable Financial Services Terms permit, Stripe and its Affiliates may invest funds they hold into liquid investments. Stripe or its applicable Affiliates will (a) hold these investments separate from investments made with their own funds; and (b) own, and User will not receive, any earnings from these investments. Stripe's and its Affiliates' investment of funds will not affect or delay Stripe's payout obligations under this Agreement.
5.3 Regulated Money Transmission; Stripe Status.
Certain Services involve regulated money transmission under U.S. Law. To the extent that your use of the Services involves money transmission or other regulated services under U.S. Law, Stripe’s Affiliate, SPC, provides those regulated Services, and the SPC terms located on or accessible from the Stripe Legal Page will apply to you, unless the applicable Services Terms specify otherwise. Stripe is not a bank, and does not accept deposits.
5.4 Dormant Accounts.
If you leave any funds dormant in a Stripe Account and you do not instruct Stripe on where to send them, Stripe may deem the funds abandoned by you and deliver them to the appropriate Governmental Authority. However, if Law requires, Stripe will attempt to notify you before doing so.
5.5 Assessed Fines.
You (a) are responsible for all Assessed Fines; and (b) must reimburse Stripe for its payment of Assessed Fines, except to the extent the Assessed Fines result from Stripe’s (i) breach of Law, the Agreement, or Financial Services Terms; or (ii) negligence.

Payment Method Rules and Payment Method Terms are Financial Services Terms for purposes of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and the Payment Method Rules or Payment Method Terms, the applicable Payment Method Rules or Payment Method Terms will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

4. Processing Transactions.
4.1 Payment Authorization Requests.
(a)
Processing Transactions.
To enable Stripe to process Transactions for you, you authorize and direct Stripe, its Affiliates, Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to receive and settle, as applicable, settlement funds owed to you through your use of the Stripe Payments Services. You may only submit Transactions that Customers authorize, and only after the applicable goods have been shipped or services provided to the Customer; except, you may submit a Transaction before goods have been shipped or services have been provided to the Customer where the Customer has authorized a Transaction for a partial or full prepayment for goods or services to be provided at a future time, or you have obtained the Customer’s consent.
(b)
Transaction Responsibility
. You must not proceed with a Transaction if (i) you know or should have known that the Transaction was fraudulent, not authorized by the Customer, or illegal in your or your Customer’s jurisdiction; (ii) you receive a response declining to authorize the Transaction; or (iii) the Customer’s ability to use a Payment Method has expired or is no longer valid. You must not split payment for a single transaction into multiple Transactions except as the Payment Method Rules, Payment Method Terms and Acquirer Terms expressly permit. You must not submit any Transaction that duplicates a Transaction that is already subject to a Dispute, or was previously disputed and subsequently resolved in your favor. Stripe may refuse to process, or condition or suspend any Transaction that Stripe believes (x) may violate this Agreement or other agreement you have with Stripe (if any); (y) is unauthorized, fraudulent or illegal; or (z) exposes, or is likely to expose, Stripe, you or others to unacceptable risk.
4.2 Pooled Accounts.
You appoint Stripe and Stripe’s Affiliate, SPC, as your agents for the limited purpose of directing, receiving, holding and settling funds under this Agreement. All settlement funds Stripe or, as applicable, SPC receives for Transactions are combined with settlement funds for other users and held in one or more Pooled Accounts at one or more Financial Partners. Once Stripe or SPC (as applicable) receives funds for a Transaction on your behalf, the relevant Customer has no further obligation to make payments to you with respect to that Transaction, regardless of whether and when Stripe or SPC (as applicable) settles those funds to you. If Stripe or SPC (as applicable) does not settle funds due to you under this Agreement, you will have recourse only against Stripe or SPC (as applicable) and not the relevant Customer. Stripe will promptly update your Stripe Account balance to reflect processed Transactions. If, in the capacity as your agent, Stripe or its Affiliate provide a receipt for a Transaction to the applicable Customer, that receipt is binding on you. Stripe and its Affiliates (as applicable) may invest funds held in a Pooled Account as described in Section 5.2 of the General Terms. You have no rights to any Pooled Account, or earnings generated by funds held in any Pooled Account, and are not entitled to draw funds from any Pooled Account.
4.3 Transaction Settlement Funds.
Stripe will transfer settlement funds for Transactions, net of Fees, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals and other amounts owed to Stripe, from the applicable Pooled Account to the applicable User Bank Account within the time period stated in the Payout Schedule, unless a Payout Delay occurs and affects the transfer initiation, or Stripe exercises a right under this Agreement to withhold or delay the transfer. However, Stripe may impose an additional holding period before making the initial settlement to a User Bank Account.
4.4 Sending Funds to Third-Party Recipients.
Stripe may offer you the ability to send to a third party funds owed to you as you instruct Stripe (including by sending all or part of the positive balance in your Stripe Account to that third-party recipient’s Stripe account or bank account), instead of settling funds to a User Bank Account. If Stripe or SPC sends funds to a third-party recipient which may include the use of a payment intermediary operating on your behalf, as this Section 4.4 contemplates, then Stripe’s and SPC’s obligations (and all applicable Payment Method Provider and Payment Method Acquirer obligations) to settle those funds to you are satisfied.
4.5 Settlement Fees.
Stripe is not responsible for any fees imposed by banks to which Stripe transfers funds, including the banks that hold the User Bank Accounts and the third-party recipient accounts.
4.6 Subscriptions and Invoicing.
If you use the Services to submit recurring or subscription Transactions, then before submitting the initial Transaction, you must (a) inform each Customer that the relevant Transactions will occur on an ongoing basis; and (b) explain the method for canceling the Customer’s recurring billing or subscription. If you use the Services to issue invoices to Customers, you must ensure that the form and content of the invoices comply with Law and are sufficient to achieve the legal or tax effects that you are trying to achieve.
4.7 Customer Authorizations.
If you use the Stripe Payments Services for certain Transactions where the Customer is not present, including MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions, or to store a Customer’s Payment Method for future use, you may be required by Law and Payment Method Rules to obtain the Customer’s authorization (also known as a mandate or agreement for the provision of products or services) and make certain disclosures to the Customer. These disclosures may include when, and under what circumstances, the Customer’s Payment Method will be charged, how the payment amount will be determined, and how future payments can be canceled. You must retain, and provide to Stripe upon request, records demonstrating that you have (a) obtained any required Customer authorizations in compliance with Law and Payment Method Rules; and (b) only submitted Transactions as MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions that you have determined are eligible.
5. Actions Stripe May Take in Processing Transactions.
5.1 Reconciliation and Responsibility.
As between the parties, and except as required by Law, you are responsible for reviewing your Transaction history for accuracy and completeness and reconciling your Transaction history with the history of transfers from the Pooled Accounts to the User Bank Accounts. If you find an error when you reconcile your Transaction history, Stripe will reasonably cooperate with you to investigate and help correct that error as long as you notify Stripe of the error within 60 days after the error appears in your Transaction history. Stripe may correct any errors in your Transaction history by crediting or debiting the User Bank Accounts.
5.2 Negative Balances.
If your Stripe Account balance (or the Stripe Account balance of any User Entity) is negative, or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you (or a User Entity) owe to a Stripe Entity or Customers, then without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the General Terms, Stripe may debit the User Bank Accounts by the amount necessary to collect, and pay out to Customers if applicable, the amounts you owe.
5.3 Disputes; Refunds; Reversals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, you are liable to Stripe for the full amount of all Disputes (unless and until a Dispute is resolved to final disposition in your favor according to applicable Payment Method Rules and as described in the Documentation), Refunds and Reversals regardless of the reason or timing.
(a)
Disputes
. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out a Transaction amount from funds owed to you if Stripe reasonably believes that a Dispute is likely to occur with respect to that Transaction. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out amounts subject to an actual Dispute until the Payment Method Provider resolves the Dispute.
(b)
Refunds
. If you intend to issue a Refund to a Customer, you must initiate a Refund instruction via the Services within 5 days after informing the Customer of your intention. Stripe may refuse to act upon a Refund instruction, or delay executing the instruction, if you are the subject of an Insolvency Event, if it would cause a negative balance in your Stripe Account, or if Stripe believes that there is a risk you will not meet your liabilities under this Agreement.
(c)
Reversals
. Without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 5.4 - 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms, Stripe may initiate a Reversal if:
(i) the Payment Method Provider invalidates the Transaction;
(ii)    you receive funds in error for any reason;
(iii)   you were not authorized to accept the Transaction;
(iv)    you receive funds related to activities that violate this Agreement, Law or Financial Services Terms; or
(v) a Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer requires Stripe to do so under the applicable Financial Services Terms.
5.4    Stripe Remedies – Specific Triggers.
Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if Stripe determines that a User Entity:
(a) has incurred or is likely to incur excessive Disputes, Refunds or Reversals;
(b) has submitted one or more Transactions for goods or services not immediately deliverable to the Customer without first obtaining Stripe’s consent;
(c) has a negative Stripe Account balance;

(f) has experienced or is likely to experience a deterioration of its business or financial condition that Stripe considers to be material;

(h) has violated or is likely to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;
(i) has caused or is likely to cause Stripe to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;
(j) has experienced or is likely to experience a Change of Control;
(k) has, either itself or by way of its employees, agents, directors or contractors, initiated Transactions or undertaken any other action that is or is likely to be fraudulent, suspicious or involve criminal activity;
(l) has, without Stripe’s prior consent, changed its business model (including services supplied by a User Entity to its customers), exposing Stripe to increased risk; or
(m) has acted in a manner or engaged in business, trading practice or other activity that presents an unacceptable risk.
5.5 Stripe Remedies – General Trigger.
Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if (a) Stripe reasonably determines that Stripe may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, criminal activity or other risks associated with a User Entity after these Stripe Payments Terms terminate; or (b) Law requires.
5.6 Stripe Remedies – Scope.

(a) initiate Reversals;
(b) change the Payout Schedule or delay or cancel the payout of funds to the User Bank Accounts;

(d) debit the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Entities;
(e) suspend or terminate your ability to accept or process Transactions;
(f) refuse to (i) process Transactions, and (ii) act upon Refund instructions; and
(g) setoff or recoup all liability that Stripe reasonably determines a User Entity owes to a Stripe Entity under this Agreement or another agreement, against any amounts that a Stripe Entity, owes to a User Entity whether the liability is matured, unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated.
5.7 Reserve.
If Stripe establishes a Reserve, Stripe will notify you of the Reserve terms. Stripe may change the Reserve terms (a) if Stripe believes that there is, or is likely to be, a change in the underlying risk presented by the User Group’s use of Stripe services; or (b) as a Payment Method Acquirer or Payment Method Provider requires. You have no legal or equitable right or interest in any Reserve, in the funds held in any Reserve, or earnings generated by funds held in any Reserve, and are not entitled to draw funds from any Reserve. If you become subject to an Insolvency Event, funds held in a Reserve will not be part of any estate created in connection with that Insolvency Event. Stripe may fund the Reserve through any or all of:
(i) using funds you provide upon Stripe’s request;
(ii)    using funds that a Stripe Entity owes to any User Entity for Transactions that the User Group accepts through the Stripe Payments Services; or
(iii)   debiting the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Entities.
5.8 Security Interest.
You grant Stripe a lien on and security interest in your interest, if any, in (a) all funds owed to you for Transactions (including funds owed to you for future Transactions and all funds that Stripe holds on your behalf); and (b) all rights to receive credits and payments under this Agreement. You must execute all documents and provide all authorizations that Stripe reasonably requests for the purpose of creating, perfecting (including filing relevant documents), maintaining and enforcing this lien and security interest, even if the request is made after your Stripe Account balance becomes negative.
5.9 Credit Support Requirement.
Stripe may require that you provide a guarantee (including a personal, parent or bank guarantee) or letter of credit in a form and substance that satisfies Stripe. In this event, Stripe will inform you of the amount of and the reasons for the requirement. If you are unable to satisfy the requirement when Stripe requires you to do so, Stripe may suspend or terminate your access to the Services.
6. Multi-Currency Processing.
Stripe may offer Multi-Currency Processing. To use Multi-Currency Processing, you must provide to Stripe a valid bank account for each currency for which you request settlement, based on the list of available settlement currencies stated in the Documentation. Each of these bank accounts is a User Bank Account for the purposes of this Agreement. If you use Multi-Currency Processing, Stripe will identify at the time of each applicable Transaction the conversion rate that will apply to the Transaction. In the event of a Refund, the conversion rate that will be used to calculate the Refund will be the rate in effect at the time of the Refund.
7. Post-Termination Obligations.
7.1 Completion of Transactions.
Following termination of these Stripe Payments Terms, you must fulfill your obligations related to existing Transactions, not accept new Transactions via the Services, and remove all Marks of a Stripe Entity or a Financial Partner from your website (unless permitted under a separate license with the applicable Financial Partner). Stripe will complete Transactions initiated before termination as long as Stripe would have completed those Transactions were these Stripe Payments Terms still in place (e.g., Stripe will not complete a Transaction if a Financial Partner prohibits Stripe from doing so). Termination does not affect your responsibility for Transactions described in Section 3 of these Stripe Payments Terms.
7.2 Provision of Payment Account Details.
If these Stripe Payments Terms terminate for reasons other than your breach, then within 30 days after the termination date, you may request in writing that Stripe provide all relevant Payment Account Details to an alternative PCI-DSS Level 1-certified payment processor that you identify to Stripe. Stripe will provide the Payment Account Details that you are entitled to receive to the named payment processor to the extent commercially reasonable. Stripe may delay or refuse any request if Stripe believes the payment processor you have identified does not have systems or controls in place that are sufficient to protect Payment Account Details, that the integrity of Payment Account Details may be compromised, or that Law or Financial Services Terms do not allow Stripe to provide the Payment Account Details.
8. User Information Updates.
You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in the average time between the initial charge and fulfillment of Customer orders. Upon request, you must promptly provide to Stripe information related to Transactions and Disputes, including (a) refund and shipping policies (if applicable); (b) data on captured but unfulfilled charges; and (c) data on the time between charge capture and fulfillment of Customer orders.
9. PCI Standards Compliance.
If you elect to store or hold "Account Data," as defined in the PCI Standards (including Customer card account number or expiration date), you must maintain a system that complies with the PCI Standards and upon Stripe’s request, you must provide to Stripe evidence of your compliance. If you do not comply with the PCI Standards, or if Stripe or any Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer is unable to verify your compliance with the PCI Standards, Stripe may suspend your Stripe Account or terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part. If you intend to use a third-party service provider to store or transmit Payment Account Details (including Customer card account number and expiration date) then you must not share any Payment Account Details with the service provider until you verify that the third party holds sufficient certifications under the PCI Standards, and must
notify Stripe
of your intention to share Payment Account Details with the service provider. Further, you agree to never store or hold any "Sensitive Authentication Data," as defined by the PCI Standards (including the card verification value or similar security code), at any time. You can find information about the PCI Standards on the
PCI Council’s website
.
10. Representations and Warranties.
You represent as of the Effective Date, and warrant during the Term, that (a) you only use the Payment Methods and Stripe Payments Services for bona fide commercial transactions (which must be free of liens, claims, and encumbrances other than ordinary sales taxes) for the sale of goods or services to, or other act with, Customers; (b) except as Stripe approves, you do not use the Stripe Payments Services for intercompany transactions; (c) you fulfill all of your obligations to Customers; and (d) you and your third-party service providers that store, access or transmit Payment Account Details comply with the PCI Standards, as applicable.
11. Fraudulent Transactions.
As between the parties, you are responsible for all (a) losses, damages, and costs Stripe and its Affiliates incur due to fraudulent Transactions, and the limitations on liability in Section 12.2 of the SSA do not apply; and (b) costs associated with any Financial Partner-initiated audit or forensic investigation arising out of or relating to your use of the Stripe Payments Services.
12. Liability for Failure to Transfer Funds.
The limitation of liability in Section 12.2(b) of the General Terms will not apply to claims you or your Affiliates make against the Stripe Parties for failing to transfer any settlement funds the Stripe Parties receive and owe to you in connection with the Stripe Payments Services. For these claims, the Stripe Parties’ liability is limited to the amount that the Stripe Parties have received and owe, but failed to transfer, to you.

Stripe Connect Terms
”) supplement the General Terms and the Stripe Payments Terms and govern your use of the Stripe Connect Services as a Stripe Connect Platform. You may use the Stripe Connect Services to (a) enable your Platform Users to use the Services in conjunction with your Platform Services; and (b) make payouts to Payout Recipients.
2. Stripe Obligations.
2.1 Connected Accounts.
Connected Accounts may use the Services in accordance with the Connected Account Agreement. Stripe may suspend or stop providing any Services to (a) a Payout Recipient for any reason; and (b) all other Connected Accounts in accordance with the terms of the Connected Account Agreement. Except for Connected Accounts that are Payout Recipients, Stripe has a direct contractual relationship with each Connected Account under the Connected Account Agreement and will provide the Services directly to each Connected Account. You acknowledge that Connected Accounts may choose to use Stripe services outside of the Connected Accounts’ relationship with you.
2.2 Amendments to Connected Account Agreement.
For Custom Accounts, Express Accounts and all other Connected Accounts that do not have a Stripe Dashboard, Stripe will notify you if Stripe modifies the relevant Connected Account Agreement. You must notify those Connected Accounts (excluding Payout Recipients) of the modification promptly after you receive the modification notice from Stripe.
2.3 Definitions Applied to Connected Accounts; General Terms Clarification.
Where defined terms are applied to a Connected Account (rather than you) in these terms, the relevant definition will be deemed to reference the Connected Account (e.g., when the term Services is applied to a Connected Account it means the Stripe services that Stripe makes available to the Connected Account under the Connected Account Agreement, and when the term Disputes is applied to a Connected Account it means Disputes that Connected Account incurs). Connected Accounts are not third parties for the purposes of, or eligible to make a Claim under, Section 11 of the General Terms.
3. Your Obligations.
3.1 Stripe Connect Services Integration and Use.
You must integrate the Stripe API and use the Stripe Connect Services in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement. You must use the Stripe Connect Services and Connected Account Data in accordance with Law and your Platform Provider Agreement. You must clearly and prominently disclose all Platform Fees, if any, and, to the extent charged separately, the Services.
3.2 Connected Accounts and Transactional Risk.
You must ensure that Connected Accounts do not use the Services in breach of the Connected Account Agreement or for any activity that Law or this Agreement prohibits. You must immediately inform Stripe if you become aware that a Connected Account is engaging in any activity that is fraudulent, deceptive or harmful, or in breach of the Connected Account Agreement or this Agreement. You must cooperate with Stripe to reduce the risk of fraud or other misuse of the Services, including by providing relevant information to Stripe.
3.3 Prohibited and Restricted Businesses.
You must ensure that no Connected Account uses the Services to conduct a Prohibited or Restricted Business or transact with a Prohibited or Restricted Business.
3.4 Activity.
A Connected Account may perform Activity, or you may perform Activity on behalf of a Connected Account, depending on how you integrate the Stripe API into your Platform Services. You are responsible for all Activity initiated by you, your representatives, and any individual or entity using your credentials, including your Stripe Account login and password and your Stripe API key. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, where either Stripe or a Connected Account incurs any losses, damages or costs based on unauthorized Activity initiated by you or on your behalf, then as between Stripe and you, you are liable for those losses, damages or costs.
3.5 Your Agreements with Connected Accounts.
Your Platform Provider Agreement must explain how you access and use Connected Account Data, and the Activity that you may conduct on the Connected Accounts’ behalf via the Stripe Connect Services. Your Platform Provider Agreement must also authorize you to perform that Activity, and to share the Connected Account Data with Stripe.
3.6 Limitations.
You must not use the Stripe Connect Services to access any Connected Account Data or conduct any Activity, or attempt to do either, for which the relevant Connected Account has not authorized, or has withdrawn the authorization.
4. Stripe Connected Account Options.
4.1 Platform Account Options.
You may elect to enroll each Platform User as (a) one of Stripe's named Connected Account types: Standard Account, Custom Account or Express Account; or (b) a Connected Account with a distinct combination of attributes (e.g., onboarding experience and dashboard user interfaces, Merchant Loss risk management and pricing controls), as described in the Documentation. Depending on your enrollment election, you may (a) assist your Platform Users in creating Stripe accounts or integrating their existing Stripe accounts into your Platform Services; and (b) provide Connected Account Data to Stripe during the enrollment process. Section 8 of the General Terms applies to all Connected Account Data that you provide to Stripe. Stripe may refuse to create a Stripe account for a Platform User or limit the functionality available to a Platform User until Stripe is satisfied that it has received sufficient information about that Platform User.
4.2 Attribute-Based Connected Accounts.
This Section 4.2 only applies to Connected Accounts that are enrolled with a distinct combination of attributes (i.e., not Standard Accounts, Custom Accounts or Express Accounts).
(a)
Enrollment.
You must create and manage the Stripe accounts for these Connected Accounts. You must ensure that Connected Account Data is provided to Stripe in the manner prescribed in the Documentation, and that Connected Accounts without Platform Pricing Control have access to the Stripe Dashboard.
(b)
Connected Account Agreement.
You must ensure that each Platform User that you intend to onboard as one of these Connected Accounts agrees to the Connected Account Agreement before it uses any Stripe services. You may surface the Connected Account Agreement either through a Stripe-powered onboarding flow (e.g., embedded, Stripe-hosted or Stripe-assisted onboarding), or through your own onboarding flow. At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that these agreements have been entered into between the Connected Accounts and Stripe. If Stripe believes that your existing acceptance process does not create a binding agreement between Stripe and each Connected Account, then, upon Stripe’s request, you must modify that process as Stripe requires.
(c)
Responsibility for Connected Accounts.
As between Stripe and you, you are responsible for all Activity on these Connected Accounts, whether initiated by you or not, and are liable to Stripe for all resulting Merchant Losses (except with respect to SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts to the extent stated in Section 5.2 below) and any other losses, damages, and costs that result from use of the Services, including any fines assessed by Financial Partners or Governmental Authorities, except to the extent the losses, damages, or costs arise from Stripe’s breach of this Agreement or Stripe’s negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. You remain jointly and severally liable with these Connected Accounts to Stripe for these amounts, and Stripe may collect these amounts from you in accordance with the Agreement.
4.3 Standard Accounts.
This Section 4.3 only applies to Standard Accounts.
(a)
Enrollment.
For Standard Accounts, you will have access to certain Connected Account Data. Stripe may require you to collect and provide additional Connected Account Data to validate a Standard Account.
(b)
Termination.
A Standard Account may at any time terminate your ability to conduct Activity on its Stripe account.
4.4 Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.
This Section 4.4 only applies to Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.
(a)
Enrollment.
You must create and manage the Stripe accounts for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts. You must ensure that Connected Account Data is passed to Stripe in the manner prescribed in the Documentation.
(b)
Connected Account Agreement for Custom Accounts.
You must ensure that each Platform User that you intend to onboard as a Custom Account agrees to the Connected Account Agreement before it uses any Stripe services. At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that these agreements have been entered into between the Custom Accounts and Stripe. If Stripe believes that your existing acceptance process does not create a binding agreement between Stripe and each Custom Account, then, upon Stripe’s request, you must modify that process as Stripe requires.
(c)
Stripe Dashboard.
Custom Accounts will not have access to a Stripe Dashboard.
(d)
Responsibility for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.
You are responsible and liable to Stripe for all Activity on Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, whether initiated by you or not, including all Transactions, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, associated fines, and any use of the Services in a manner prohibited under this Agreement or the Connected Account Agreement. You and the relevant Connected Account are jointly and severally liable to Stripe for amounts the Connected Account owes to Stripe, and Stripe may collect these amounts from you in accordance with this Agreement. If Stripe determines that your responsibility for Activity on Custom Accounts and Express Accounts creates an unacceptable risk to Stripe, Stripe may exercise its remedies listed in Section 5.6 of the Stripe Payments Terms.
4.5 Payout Recipients.
Stripe may enable you to make payouts to Payout Recipients. For the purpose of these payouts, Stripe does not provide any service directly to the Payout Recipients, and the Payout Recipients do not have a contractual or business relationship with Stripe. To the extent Stripe makes payouts to Payout Recipients, it does so on your behalf. To receive these payouts, Payout Recipients will not enter into a Connected Account Agreement and that concept, as used in these Stripe Connect Terms, will not apply to Connected Accounts that are Payout Recipients. You must complete a Stripe account application for each Payout Recipient and enroll them as a Custom Account or an Express Account. Each Payout Recipient is subject to Stripe’s approval. You must ensure that each Payout Recipient receives the Stripe Recipient Notice before you make a payout to the Payout Recipient. By making payouts to Payout Recipients, you are using Stripe Payments Services.
5. Stripe Managed Risk Services.
5.1 Requirements for Using Stripe Managed Risk Services.
(a)
Enrollment.
When using Stripe Managed Risk Services, all your Connected Accounts must be SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts, except (i) as Stripe expressly approves in writing signed by the parties or as is otherwise permitted in the Documentation; (ii) when you are transitioning pre-existing Platform Users from Connected Account types that do not enable Stripe Managed Risk Services to SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts, which you must do within a reasonable time period and in accordance with the Documentation; and (iii) during the Post-SMR Transition Period.
(b)
Required Stripe Technology.
You must use all applicable Stripe Technology that Stripe requires for using Stripe Managed Risk Services as described in the Documentation (e.g., Stripe-powered onboarding and interfaces). Stripe will enable Stripe Radar Services on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts by default, and you must not disable these Services. The Fees for Stripe Radar Services are not included in the Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees.
5.2 Liability for Merchant Losses.
As between you and Stripe, Stripe is liable for Merchant Losses on an SMR-Enabled Connected Account up to the amount of the risk cap, if any is expressly agreed on by the parties, except (a) as stated in Section 5.5; and (b) to the extent these Merchant Losses arise from your fraud, violation of Law, breach of the Agreement (including these Stripe Connect Terms), negligence, willful misconduct, or misuse of the Stripe Connect Services. The limitations on liability in Section 12 of the General Terms will not apply with respect to Stripe’s liability for Merchant Losses under this Section 5.2.
5.3 Changes in Risk Profile.
Stripe determines the Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees based on the risk profile Stripe associates with your Connected Accounts. If Stripe determines that the risk profile of your SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts changes significantly, then Stripe may revise the Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees. Stripe will notify you at least 30 days (or a longer period if Law requires) before the revised Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees apply to you.
5.4 Transitioning Off Stripe Managed Risk Services.
To transition off Stripe Managed Risk Services, you must either permanently stop using Stripe Connect Services with respect to all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts, or migrate all payments volume from SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts to Connected Account types that do not enable Stripe Managed Risk Services within a reasonable time period. Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees will continue to apply for all Transactions on SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts during and after the Post-SMR Transition Period.
5.5 Liability for Merchant Losses During Post-SMR Transition Period.
You and the relevant Platform User become jointly and severally liable to Stripe for all Merchant Losses on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts associated with a Platform User from when you initiate the first Transaction for that Platform User on a Connected Account type that does not enable Stripe Managed Risk Services. Stripe may collect these amounts according to the Agreement and the Connected Account Agreement, as applicable, including Merchant Losses that arise during the Post-SMR Transition Period resulting from Activity that occurred before the Post-SMR Transition Period. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, Stripe’s aggregate liability for Merchant Losses on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts during the Post-SMR Transition Period will not exceed the amount of the General Damages cap stated in Section 12 of the General Terms. Stripe’s liability for Merchant Losses on SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts ends at the end of the Post-SMR Transition Period.
6. Tax Reporting; Tax Invoicing.
6.1 Filing of Tax Information Reports.
Unless Stripe notifies you otherwise, Stripe will not file any, and you assume sole responsibility and liability for filing all, Tax Information Reports required to be filed as a result of Services Stripe provides to you under this Agreement or to Connected Accounts under their Connected Account Agreement. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, if applicable, Stripe will file Tax Information Reports with respect to payments made to Standard Accounts, and for Transactions on Connected Accounts that do not have Platform Pricing Control.
6.2 Indemnity.
You will indemnify Stripe from all Taxes, and related interest, penalties and fees (excluding any income, franchise or similar taxes payable with respect to the Fees), if any, imposed on a Stripe Entity as a result of your failure to timely file any Tax Information Report under Section 6.1 of these Stripe Connect Terms.
6.3 Issuing Tax Forms.
When Stripe files Tax Information Reports as stated in Section 6.1, Stripe will issue Tax Information Reports (if applicable) directly to the Connected Accounts.

6.4 Tax Invoices.
(a)
Standard Accounts, Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.
For Standard Accounts, Stripe will issue Tax invoices, as applicable, to: (i) you under these Stripe Connect Terms; (ii) Standard Accounts under their Connected Account Agreement; or (iii) both you and the Standard Accounts.

All Other Connected Accounts.
For all other Connected Accounts, you and Stripe agree (i) for each Transaction on Connected Accounts that do not have Platform Pricing Control, Stripe is providing its Services to the Connected Accounts and will issue Tax invoices directly to the Connected Accounts only; and (ii) for each Transaction on Connected Accounts that have Platform Pricing Control, Stripe is providing its Services to you and will issue Tax invoices directly to you only, and you will be treated as making separate taxable supplies to your Connected Accounts for purposes of this section.
7. IRS Form 1099 Services.
7.1 IRS Form 1099 Services.
You may use the IRS Form 1099 Services to generate copies of IRS Form 1099 and deliver them to the applicable Governmental Authorities, as described in the Documentation.
7.2 Disclaimer.
When using IRS Form 1099 Services, you are responsible for, and Stripe disclaims all liability with respect to:
(a) your fulfillment of your obligations under Law, including with respect to Taxes;
(b) the accuracy of the Tax calculations, and your obligation to pay any fine, penalty, or other sanction imposed by a Governmental Authority as a result of the use of the IRS Form 1099 Services; and
(c) your action, or failure to act, as a result of any directions or recommendations you receive related to the use of the IRS Form 1099 Services.

Stripe will not validate, and is not responsible for, the accuracy of the information you or your Connected Accounts provide to Stripe. The IRS Form 1099 Services do not constitute tax advice, or tax filing or reporting assistance.
8. Data Use.
Each party may use Connected Account Data in accordance with this Agreement and any consent or agreement it obtains from each Connected Account, which, as to Stripe, includes the Connected Account Agreement. You must provide all notices and obtain all necessary rights and consents for Stripe to lawfully process Connected Account Data as you instruct. Stripe may refuse to process Connected Account Data as you instruct if Stripe reasonably believes complying with your instructions would require Stripe to violate Law or the Connected Account Agreement.
9. Your Liability for Connected Accounts.
Except with respect to Standard Accounts and except to the extent covered by Stripe Managed Risk Services if applicable, your liability for all Connected Accounts as described in these Stripe Connect Terms, including liability arising out of or relating to your failure to ensure that each Connected Account agreed to the Connected Account Agreement in a legally binding way, is not limited or excluded in any way, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement.

The currency exchange rates the Stripe Adaptive Pricing Services display or apply to your Transactions may differ from the currency exchange rates Stripe obtains from its service providers or publicly available resources.
3.2 Effect of your use of Stripe Payment Services.
How you elect to set up your Stripe Payment Services may affect the application of currency exchange rates the Stripe Adaptive Pricing Services provides to your Customers.

Stripe Climate
Last modified: November 20, 2023
These Stripe Climate Commitment terms (“
Climate Commitment Terms
”) and Stripe Climate Orders terms (“
Climate Orders Terms
”) (collectively, the “
Terms
”) supplement the General Terms, and govern your use of Stripe Climate Commitment and Stripe Climate Orders. Frontier Climate Operations, LLC (“
Frontier
”), Stripe’s Affiliate, provides Stripe Climate Orders. For purposes of Stripe Climate Orders, each reference to "
Stripe
" in the General Terms will be read as a reference to Frontier.
1. Overview.
Stripe conducts research into Climate Projects and purchases carbon removal services.  You may make voluntary contributions to Climate Projects through Stripe Climate Commitment. Frontier uses Offtake Agreements to acquire Carbon Removal Units. You may verify the availability of, and purchase Retirement Services through Stripe Climate Orders.
2. Stripe Climate Commitment Terms.
2.1 Opting In and Out, and Changes.
You must opt in to make a contribution during onboarding or via the Stripe Climate Commitment page of your Stripe Dashboard You may opt out of, change, or pause your contribution to Stripe Climate Commitment at any time in your Stripe Dashboard.
2.2 Climate Commitment Funds.
(a)
Climate Commitment Funds Allocation
. Once you opt in, Stripe or its Affiliate may deduct the Climate Commitment Funds from your Stripe Account balance or User Bank Account on a per-Transaction basis, or as an amount aggregated over a period of time, as described in your Stripe Dashboard. Stripe will allocate all Climate Commitment Funds to advance the field of carbon removal, through activities such as purchasing metric tons of carbon removal, or funding research and development for new carbon removal technologies. Climate Commitment Funds are not refundable.
(b)
Stripe Climate Commitment Goals
. The goal of Stripe Climate Commitment is to help advance the field of carbon removal and Climate Commitment Funds will be used in support of that goal. While Stripe will use reasonable efforts to fund impactful Climate Projects, companies receiving Climate Commitment Funds are developing new technology in an evolving industry and their survival and success in addressing climate issues are not guaranteed. Development timelines of many new technologies are long, the resulting impact may not be immediate, and there is always a risk that the chosen technologies fail to deliver any carbon removal. Even if they are eventually successful in obtaining results, Climate Projects may take years to produce those results.
(c)
Use of Climate Commitment Funds
. You decide voluntarily whether to, and in what amount, to allocate Climate Commitment Funds. Stripe may choose not to use your Climate Commitment Funds immediately after deducting them from your Stripe Account; rather, Stripe may allocate them after Stripe identifies a Climate Project. Stripe will inform you regularly about how Climate Commitment Funds were allocated. Stripe will not apply Climate Commitment Funds toward its own corporate or administrative costs.
(d)
No Carbon Credits
. The carbon removal services Stripe purchases are not certified by any governmental or non-governmental body. They are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Stripe disclaims all warranties regarding (i) the status under applicable governmental or non-governmental programs or pursuant to standards set by governmental or non-governmental bodies, whether implemented now or in the future, (ii) the availability of any current or future tax credit, benefit, or treatment, or (iii) any other financial benefits, associated with  the carbon removal services that Stripe purchases.
(e)
Taxes
. The Climate Commitment Funds you allocate may not be eligible for a tax deduction. You should consult with your tax or legal advisor on the local tax treatment of allocated Climate Commitment Funds. Climate Commitment Funds exclude all Taxes, except as the Documentation states to the contrary.
3. Stripe Climate Orders Terms.
3.1 Your Use of Stripe Climate Orders.
You must only use Stripe Climate Orders in compliance with these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. You must use the Stripe Climate Orders for business purposes only, which must be consistent with the business purpose descriptions you provided to Stripe at the time of onboarding and updated at any time thereafter. You may not use the Stripe Climate Orders for personal, family, or household use.
3.2 CRUs.
(a) Frontier uses Offtake Agreements to acquire CRUs, as further described on the Frontier Webpage. To the extent commercially reasonable, Frontier will review (i) the sources of CRUs; and (ii) the terms governing the generation of those CRUs.
(b) Frontier will make Retirement Services available to you for purchase subject to: (i) the availability of CRUs in carbon markets; (ii) Frontier’s ability to secure all necessary rights (including contractual rights) for the future delivery of the CRUs; and (iii) Frontier’s receipt of those CRUs. You may verify the availability of CRUs for Retirement, and purchase Retirement Services using the Climate API or the Dashboard.  While Frontier will provide you with information about the CRUs available for Retirement, it is your responsibility to verify that the CRUs meet your needs or the needs of a Beneficiary.
(c) Frontier may be unable to acquire sufficient quantities of CRUs to fulfill orders for Retirement Services. The CRU(s) that Frontier ultimately Retires on your behalf may have been generated from an Offtake Agreement that Frontier executed after your initial purchase. In order to provide Retirement Services, Frontier reserves the right to: (i) substitute CRUs from any one carbon removal supplier with a CRU from a different carbon removal supplier; or (ii) allocate then-current inventory of CRUs among Purchasers.
(d) The CRUs are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Frontier disclaims all warranties regarding (i) the status of CRUs under applicable governmental or non-governmental programs or pursuant to standards set by governmental or non-governmental bodies, whether implemented now or in the future, (ii) the availability of any current or future tax credit, benefit, or treatment, or (iii) any other financial benefits, associated with your purchase of Retirement Services or the associated CRU(s).
3.3 Retirement.
(a) On or before the last day of the Retirement Year, Frontier: (i) on your behalf, will Retire the CRU; or (ii) if applicable, will transfer title to the CRU to you. If you have designated a Beneficiary, Frontier will Retire the CRU on that Beneficiary’s behalf and include the Beneficiary’s name in the Registry, if permitted. Frontier will Retire and record the CRU in the applicable Registry in accordance with and subject to the rules of that Registry.
(b) Frontier may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, Retire and record partial CRUs (i.e., partial tons) with a Registry. Frontier may combine partial CRUs and record them in Frontier’s name.
(c) If Frontier Retires a CRU on your behalf or on behalf of a Beneficiary, Frontier will notify you of the Retirement via the Climate API, the Dashboard, or, if applicable, by other means you elect in the Dashboard, and deliver a certificate to you evidencing Retirement. Certificates will be digital.
(d) In the event Frontier does not receive sufficient CRUs to fulfill all orders for Retirement Services, Frontier reserves the right, in its sole discretion: (i) to allocate CRUs among Purchasers; or (ii) refund the Fees.
(e) If Frontier determines that it is unable to Retire a CRU in your name or in the Beneficiary’s name on or prior to the last day of the Retirement Year of the CRU, Frontier will notify you and, in its sole discretion: (i) may refund the applicable Fees; (ii) may transfer title to the CRU to you; (iii) may record the Retirement of the CRU in Frontier’s name and provide certification to you that Frontier completed the Retirement in Frontier’s name; or (iv) take other reasonable remedial measures. Neither Frontier nor Stripe will pay you any interest on Fees, and Frontier will have no further obligation to you regarding that Retirement and the associated CRU(s) nor any other obligation to complete any additional Retirements. Frontier will not be liable to you for any other losses, damages, or costs that you or others may suffer arising out of or relating to Frontier’s inability to perform the Retirement Services or the associated CRU.
(f) If Frontier is unable to contact you, or is unable to provide a refund of Fees, for any reason (e.g., you have closed your Stripe Account), Frontier will contribute any amounts due to you to carbon removal programs of its choosing.
(g) Frontier will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a CRU can be Retired on your behalf or on behalf of your designated Beneficiary. Frontier does not guarantee that Frontier will be able to Retire a CRU on behalf of a Beneficiary.
3.4 Beneficiaries.
You may designate a Beneficiary when you purchase Retirement Services. If permitted by the applicable Registry, Frontier will include the Beneficiary’s name when retiring CRUs. You are responsible for notifying a Beneficiary of a CRU’s Retirement. Frontier will not notify a Beneficiary of a CRU’s Retirement.  These Stripe Climate Orders Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties to these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. Frontier has no obligation to any Beneficiary under these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. When you designate a Beneficiary, you will not provide Frontier with a Beneficiary’s Personal Data.
3.5 Power of Attorney.
To the extent necessary, you grant to Frontier a power of attorney to act on your behalf or on behalf of a Beneficiary to provide Stripe Climate Orders.

You must resubmit the modified Card design to Stripe for approval using the same process.
4.2 Card Orders.
You may order Cards through your Stripe Dashboard (or, if applicable, through your Platform Provider).

Risk of loss for Cards passes to the recipient (you or your Platform Provider) when Stripe ships the Card to the address specified in the order.
4.3 Card Ownership; Limitations.

If Stripe requests that you or an Issuing Authorized User return a Card, then you must return, or ensure that the Issuing Authorized User returns, that Card promptly to Stripe or the Issuing Bank as Stripe instructs.

You represent as of the date you submit User Materials for a Card to Stripe for review, and warrant at all times during the Term, that you have the necessary rights in the User Materials to use (and grant Stripe the rights to use) the User Materials on the Cards or for the purposes of the Stripe Issuing Program. You grant to Stripe and its Affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the User Materials on Cards and applicable Stripe Issuing Program materials. You also grant to Stripe and its Affiliates the right to sublicense these rights to third parties that Stripe engages to create Cards and applicable Stripe Issuing Program materials. If you terminate or revoke the license to the User Materials, then (a) Stripe will stop producing new Cards carrying the User Materials and stop using the User Materials for the purposes of the Stripe Issuing Program; (b) Stripe will not be obligated to recall, destroy or replace any existing Cards carrying the User Materials; and (c) Stripe will not be liable for any delay or failure in performing its obligations to the extent they are adversely affected by the termination or revocation.
5. Activation and Limitations on Cards.
5.1 Activation.
You must activate a Card through your Stripe Dashboard (or, if applicable, through your Platform Provider) before you or an Issuing Authorized User uses that Card.

5.2 Limits and Available Spend.
The Issuing Bank will establish restrictions on the use of your Stripe Issuing Account and Cards as described in the applicable Issuing Bank Terms.

You may establish additional restrictions related to the Cards in accordance with the Issuing Bank Terms (e.g., on the dollar amount of individual Card Transactions, and the types of merchants with which your Cards may be used). Each of the Issuing Bank and Stripe may prevent Cards from functioning outside of the Territory. You must communicate all applicable restrictions to your Issuing Authorized Users. If at any time the amount of a Card Transaction exceeds Available Spend and Issuing Bank (or Stripe on Issuing Bank’s behalf) does not receive payment from another Payment Source, then, in addition to all other remedies described in Section 11.2 of these Stripe Issuing Accountholder Terms, Stripe may limit your ability to make Card Transactions.

You are solely responsible for disclosing to Issuing Authorized Users that Stripe may receive Personal Data from you. Stripe may delete or disconnect an Issuing Authorized User’s Personal Data from your Stripe Issuing Account when Law or the Card Network Rules require. If Stripe becomes aware of an unauthorized acquisition, disclosure or loss of Personal Data on Stripe’s systems, Stripe will notify you if Law allows.
10.2 Your Use of Personal Data and Stripe Data.
You must only use Personal Data related to your Stripe Issuing Account for your internal business purposes and to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement.

Credit given to the recipient by the recipient’s financial institution for any such credit Entry will be provisional until the recipient’s financial institution has received final settlement through a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise has received payment as provided for in Section 4A-403(a) of Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the State of New York. If the recipient’s financial institution does not receive such payment for the credit Entry, the recipient’s financial institution is entitled to a refund from the recipient in the amount of the credit to the recipient’s account, and you will not be considered to have paid the amount of the credit Entry to the recipient.
4. Custodial Account; FDIC Insurance.
SPC will hold the funds represented in the Financial Accounts in Custodial Accounts and will have control over those funds. Despite Section 5.2 of the General Terms, SPC and its Affiliates will not invest funds held in the Custodial Accounts, except as contemplated under Section 8.6 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms. Funds in the Custodial Accounts are expected to be eligible for pass-through FDIC Insurance, up to the then-current per depositor limit. FDIC Insurance coverage is contingent on determinations FDIC makes at the time the Treasury Bank goes into receivership or other form of insolvency. The FDIC Insurance per depositor limit applies to the aggregate of all funds that you have on deposit with the relevant Treasury Bank as beneficial owner, including all funds in another account with the Treasury Bank. FDIC Insurance applies only to funds that have settled in a Financial Account and does not apply to funds that are provisionally credited to a Financial Account or that are pending but not yet settled.
5. Set Up and Operation of the Financial Account
5.1 Identity Verification.
You must provide all information that SPC, your Stripe Connect Platform and the Treasury Bank require to open a Financial Account or add a Treasury Authorized User to a Financial Account, including:
(a) your full name and address;
(b) a government-issued identification number, such as a social security number (SSN) or taxpayer identification number (TIN); and
(c) if you are an individual, your date of birth.
5.2 Representation and Warranty.
You represent as of the date you provide the information, and warrant at all times during the Term, that all information that you provide or make available to SPC and your Stripe Connect Platform in connection with your Financial Account (including all information pertaining to your country of citizenship, residence, principal place of business, and legal and tax status) is accurate and complete. You must promptly notify your Stripe Connect Platform of each change to that information. You represent as of the date you request to open a Financial Account, and warrant at all times during the Term, that, if you are an individual opening the Financial Account for a business that is a sole proprietorship, you are the sole owner of that business.
5.3 Authority to Conduct Checks.
You authorize SPC, your Stripe Connect Platform and the Treasury Bank to obtain information about you from their service providers and other third parties, including credit reporting agencies and information bureaus. If required, you must authorize and direct these third parties to compile and provide this information to SPC or the Treasury Bank, as applicable. You agree that this information may include your name, addresses, credit history and other data (including Personal Data) about you, your representatives and your owners.
5.4 Remedies for SPC.
SPC may restrict or close your Financial Account if it or your Stripe Connect Platform is unable to obtain information about or related to you to satisfy Know Your Customer (KYC) and customer identification requirements.
5.5 Not Subject to Sanctions.
By opening a Financial Account, you represent as of the date you request the Stripe Treasury Services, and warrant at all times during the Term, that neither you nor any beneficial owner of your Financial Account is designated under or covered by any sanctions program administered or enforced by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
6. Tax Reporting.
6.1 Obligation to Provide Form W-9.
You must provide a Form W-9 certifying your tax identification number to SPC when interest starts accruing (or if Stripe requests, upon opening the Financial Account), to enable SPC to report any interest income paid on your funds held in the Custodial Account and allocated to your Financial Account. SPC will not accept a Form W-8 in lieu of a Form W-9.
6.2 Withholding by SPC.
If you are subject to backup withholding or if the IRS notifies SPC or a Treasury Bank that the Treasury Bank does not have a correct tax identification number for you, then SPC may cooperate with the Treasury Bank and withhold and remit to the IRS a percentage of any interest paid and allocated to your Financial Account. Amounts withheld are reported to the IRS as federal tax withheld and will be noted on your IRS Form 1099.
6.3 Responsibility for Tax Reporting.
You are responsible for (a) determining your tax liability related to your Financial Account; and (b) reporting and remitting in a timely manner all taxes due to the appropriate tax authority. SPC or the Treasury Bank will disclose to the relevant tax authorities all income derived from the funds held on your behalf in the Custodial Account (if any) if the Treasury Regulatory Requirements require.
6.4 Obligation to Inform.
You must promptly notify your Stripe Connect Platform of all changes related to your tax affairs, and provide all information that it or SPC requests to comply with the Treasury Regulatory Requirements.
6.5 Obligation to Provide Information.
You must assist SPC and your Stripe Connect Platform by providing records and other information as the Treasury Bank may request.
7. Treasury Authorized Users.
7.1 Instructions from Stripe Connect Platform.
You authorize SPC to accept instructions from your Stripe Connect Platform with respect to Financial Account Transactions, manage your Financial Account and take other action on your Financial Account. You must provide your Stripe Connect Platform with all information regarding your Treasury Authorized Users, any agent appointed under an applicable power of attorney, and the electronic credentials (such as logins) for your Financial Account, and you must immediately provide your Stripe Connect Platform with updated information if that information changes. You must notify your Stripe Connect Platform at least 5 business days before making any change to (a) your form of ownership (such as changing from a sole proprietor to a limited liability company or corporation); or (b) your Treasury Authorized Users.
7.2 Agents.
If you choose to appoint an agent under a power of attorney to manage the Financial Account, the power of attorney must be in a form acceptable to your Stripe Connect Platform and SPC. SPC and your Stripe Connect Platform may rely on a copy of the power of attorney and are not required to confirm its validity.
7.3 Instructions.
If SPC chooses to comply with an instruction that your Stripe Connect Platform transmits, SPC may impose any condition, including requiring that you provide SPC with a surety bond or put in place an indemnity agreement in a form that is satisfactory to SPC. SPC may refuse to comply with an instruction from your Stripe Connect Platform if SPC believes that:
(a) the instruction is fraudulent or you did not authorize it;
(b) there are multiple or conflicting instructions;
(c) your Treasury Authorized User or agent is exceeding their authority in giving the instruction; or
(d) complying with the instruction may expose SPC or its Affiliates to liability.
8. Operating Your Financial Account.
8.1 Denomination.
Your Financial Account is denominated in U.S. Dollars only. Financial Account Transactions in other currencies are not permitted.
8.2 Accessing Your Financial Account.
You may access your Financial Account and the Stripe Treasury Services through the Stripe Treasury Dashboard, and by any other means your Stripe Connect Platform makes available to you. You may use the Stripe Treasury Dashboard to view your Stripe Treasury Account Information and conduct Financial Account Transactions, including adding funds to your Financial Account, transferring funds, and making payments from your Financial Account to third parties. If you use other Services made available to you in connection with your Financial Account or the Stripe Treasury Dashboard, as applicable, additional terms may apply to those Services. You must use the Stripe Treasury Dashboard only in compliance with the documentation that your Stripe Connect Platform makes available to you.
8.3 Account Security.
You must keep your account credentials and the devices on which you access your Financial Account secure and confidential at all times. You must notify SPC immediately at treasury-support@stripe.com if there has been any actual or suspected unauthorized access to your credentials. In addition to being responsible for Financial Account Transactions conducted on your Financial Account, you are responsible for all losses, damages and costs that SPC and its Affiliates suffer as a result of your delay in notifying SPC of the unauthorized access.
8.4  Representations and Warranties.
You represent on the date you first use the Stripe Treasury Services, and warrant at all times during the Term, that:
(a) you are engaged in a commercial business enterprise organized and operating in the Stripe Treasury Territory;
(b) you reside in the Stripe Treasury Territory;
(c) you do not use the Financial Account to send or receive a payment to or from any bank account or any wire transfer provider located outside the Stripe Treasury Territory;
(d) you comply with all Treasury Regulatory Requirements in connection with your use of the Stripe Treasury Services;
(e) no funds transferred into your Financial Account are proceeds from any criminal activity; and
(f) you do not use the Stripe Treasury Services to enable any individual or entity (including you) to benefit from any Prohibited or Restricted Business.
8.5 Authorization to Share Information.
Unless the Treasury Regulatory Requirements or Stripe’s
Privacy Policy
prohibits SPC from doing so, you authorize SPC and its Affiliates to share information about you, your Financial Account, and Financial Account Transactions, with your Stripe Connect Platform and other third parties, including the Treasury Bank:
(a) to open the Financial Account and complete Financial Account Transactions;
(b) in connection with investigating any claim you initiate;
(c) to comply with Law applicable to Stripe, the Treasury Bank or your Stripe Connect Platform; and
(d) to comply with an arbitration order.
8.6 Interest.
(a)
No Interest Unless Advised
. Unless your Stripe Connect Platform advises you otherwise, you will not earn interest on funds in your Financial Account.
(b)
Allocation of Interest
. If SPC establishes an interest-bearing Custodial Account and your Stripe Connect Platform informs you that your Financial Account will bear interest, then SPC will allocate accrued interest under that Custodial Account in the proportion that your average daily balance during the preceding month bears to the average daily balance of all funds that are held in that Custodial Account over the same time period and calculated on the same basis. SPC will allocate interest to your Financial Account only in whole cents. Any fractional amount of the interest amount that would otherwise be credited to your Financial Account that is less than half of one cent will be rounded down and that fractional amount will be carried over to the following month. Any fractional amount of the funds equal to half of one cent or more will be rounded up and that fractional amount will be carried forward as negative accrual to the following month.
8.7 Legal Process.
You authorize SPC to comply with each Legal Process relating to you or your Financial Account that SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform receives, without needing to determine whether that Legal Process was validly issued or is enforceable. If a Hold is in effect, SPC will continue to charge all applicable fees, even though your Financial Account cannot be closed. SPC may charge you a fee for, and recover SPC’s costs incurred in, complying with each Legal Process. If the Treasury Regulatory Requirements permit, SPC will deduct those fees and costs from your Available Treasury Balance.
8.8 Abandoned Property.
If the Treasury Regulatory Requirements presume you have abandoned your Financial Account, then SPC will turn over the Available Treasury Balance (excluding funds subject to pending debit Financial Account Transactions or Holds) to the appropriate Governmental Authority in the Stripe Treasury Territory according to the Treasury Regulatory Requirements. You must follow the procedures that the Governmental Authority specifies to obtain your funds.
9. Transactions on Your Financial Account.
9.1 Available Treasury Balance.
Solely for the purpose of determining whether funds are available to be transferred or paid out of your Financial Account, the Available Treasury Balance is (a) increased by the amount of any pending provisionally credited Financial Account Transactions (excluding pending returns) in your Financial Account; and (b) decreased by the amount of Holds on funds in your Financial Account. You can view your Available Treasury Balance on the Stripe Treasury Dashboard.
9.2 Adding Funds to Your Financial Account.
(a)
How to Add Funds
. You may add funds to your Financial Account by a Financial Account Transaction (such as a direct deposit or an electronic transfer from an external account you own), wire transfer, or from another account at a Treasury Bank.
(b)
Agency
. You authorize SPC to act as your agent with regard to processing and collecting your Financial Account Transactions. SPC may endorse any credit Financial Account Transaction you present to be added to your Financial Account. If there is a qualified endorsement on a credit Financial Account Transaction, SPC may place your unqualified endorsement on the credit Financial Account Transaction.
(c)
No Obligation to Notify
. SPC is not obligated to notify you promptly after funds are added into your Financial Account. You can confirm via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard whether SPC has received a Financial Account Transaction that adds funds to your Financial Account.
9.3 Transfers from your Financial Account.
By initiating a transfer from your Financial Account via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard, you authorize your Stripe Connect Platform to instruct SPC to make the Financial Account Transaction you specify. SPC may deduct the amount of each transfer that your Stripe Connect Platform initiates or approves from your Available Treasury Balance, even if the transfer has not yet been completed. SPC may refuse any transfer (a) by any method that SPC does not specifically permit for your Financial Account; or (b) that does not include all information SPC or the Treasury Bank requires.
9.4 Funds Availability.
(a)
Cut-Off Times
. SPC establishes Cut-Off Times for various Financial Account Transactions and SPC will provide those Cut-Off Times to you through the Stripe Treasury Dashboard or otherwise in writing. SPC may change the Cut-Off Time from time to time. Any change to the Cut-Off Time will be effective immediately and without notice to you. You may contact SPC at any time to verify the Cut-Off Time.
(b)
Relevance of Cut-Off Times
. Subject to Section 9.4(c) of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, funds from ACH, wire transfer or a transfer from an account with the Treasury Bank that SPC receives from your Stripe Connect Platform before the Cut-Off Time will be available in your Financial Account on that business day. SPC must receive requests that you make via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard to transfer funds from your Financial Account before the Cut-Off Time in order to initiate the transfer on the same business day. If SPC receives a transfer request on or after the Cut-Off Time or on a day that is not a business day, SPC will generally initiate the transfer on the next business day.
(c)
Right to Hold Transfers
. SPC may Hold funds transferred to your Financial Account by ACH, wire transfer or a transfer from a Financial Account with the Treasury Bank if SPC has reasonable cause to doubt collectability, is concerned about potential fraud, including for new Financial Accounts or large transfers of funds, or is concerned about compliance with the Treasury Regulatory Requirements. SPC may place a Hold for more than your Available Treasury Balance.
9.5 Account Numbers.
SPC and any other person involved in the Financial Account Transaction may rely on the routing number and account number that you provide when giving a transfer instruction. If the transfer instruction gives both a routing number or account number and a name, and the name identifies a different person from the account owner identified by the number, SPC and any other person that handles the instruction may still rely exclusively on the number.
9.6 Processing Order.
SPC will process your Financial Account Transactions on each business day in the following order:
(a) first, transfers to your Financial Account that SPC receives from your Stripe Connect Platform before the Cut-Off Time will be processed in the order in which SPC receives them, but any amounts credited to your Financial Account are provisionally credited until those funds clear; and
(b) second, transfers from your Financial Account (e.g., other Financial Account Transactions resulting in deducting funds from your Financial Account) that SPC receives by the Cut-Off Time will be processed in the order in which SPC receives them.
Reversals of provisional credits may occur at any time during this process. SPC may use a different processing order if the Treasury Regulatory Requirements require.
9.7 No Overdrafts.
There is no overdraft feature associated with your Financial Account. If your Available Treasury Balance is not sufficient to pay for each Financial Account Transaction in the order in which it is processed, SPC may return or reject the Financial Account Transaction, or SPC may permit the Financial Account Transaction to proceed, in which case your Financial Account may become overdrawn. SPC does not impose a fee when it returns or rejects a Financial Account Transaction for which there are insufficient funds. However, third parties may impose a fee or other charge (such as penalty interest) for dishonored or late payments, and you are solely responsible for those fees and charges.
9.8 Use of Provisional Funds.
All Financial Account Transactions credited to your Financial Account are provisionally credited subject to final settlement. If SPC permits you to transfer funds from your Financial Account before final settlement has been made for any provisionally credited Financial Account Transaction, and final settlement is not made, then you will be liable to SPC for the amount of the drawn provisional credit, collection costs, attorneys’ fees, and all other losses, damages or costs that SPC incurs in allowing the Financial Account Transaction to proceed. SPC has the right to (a) charge your Financial Account; (b) obtain a refund from you; and (c) charge back any provisionally credited Financial Account Transaction. Except to the extent caused by SPC’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, SPC will not be liable for any losses, damages or costs resulting from any reversal of credit or return of any Financial Account Transactions.
9.9 Your Right to Stop Payment.
If you wish to stop any scheduled or preauthorized transfer from your Financial Account, then you must give your Stripe Connect Platform instructions to do so in time for the Stripe Connect Platform to instruct SPC at least 3 business days before the day on which the Financial Account Transaction is scheduled to be made. If you scheduled or preauthorized the transfer via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard, then you may change or cancel the transfer via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard at least 3 business days before the day on which the Financial Account Transaction is scheduled to be made.
9.10 SPC’s Right to Refuse.
To the extent the Treasury Regulatory Requirements do not prohibit the actions listed in this Section 9.10, SPC may refuse to complete any Financial Account Transaction, including:
(a) if your Financial Account has insufficient funds to cover a Financial Account Transaction;
(b) if SPC is unable to verify ownership of or other information about your Financial Account, or the individual or entity to or from whom the funds will be transferred;
(c) to protect the security of your Financial Account and SPC’s systems; or
(d) if the Financial Account Transaction would violate these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms or the Treasury Regulatory Requirements.
9.11 Financial Account Transaction Limitations.
There are limits on the number and value of Financial Account Transactions that you may make from your Financial Account, which are described on the Stripe Treasury Dashboard or otherwise disclosed by SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform. SPC may allow Financial Account Transactions that exceed applicable limits, or temporarily reduce your limits from time to time without notice (unless the Treasury Regulatory Requirements require otherwise). SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform may change the limits at any time.
9.12   Reviewing Your Financial Account Transactions.
(a)
Obligation to Review
. You must review your Financial Account history and each Financial Account Transaction as soon as possible. If you believe that there is an error or discrepancy in a Financial Account Transaction, you must notify your Stripe Connect Platform promptly, and no later than 30 days after your Stripe Connect Platform makes the Financial Account history available to you (or, if applicable, a longer period stated in the Treasury Regulatory Requirements). If you believe an unauthorized Financial Account Transaction has been made on your Financial Account, then you must immediately notify your Stripe Connect Platform, and in any case within 1 day after you become aware. If SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform requests, you must submit a written statement with details about the unauthorized Financial Account Transaction. If you fail to notify your Stripe Connect Platform as required under this Section 9.12(a), or your Stripe Connect Platform does not notify SPC in a timely manner, then losses, damages, or costs you suffer as a result of the unauthorized Financial Account Transaction may not be recoverable, or recovery may be more time consuming or difficult.
(b)
Assistance in Investigations
. You must assist SPC and your Stripe Connect Platform in the investigation and related prosecution of claims for unauthorized Financial Account Transactions by completing the appropriate statements and reports that SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform reasonably requests.
9.13 Withholding Financial Account Transactions.
If after final settlement of any Financial Account Transaction, you or any third party asserts a claim to your Stripe Connect Platform alleging that the Financial Account Transaction was altered, contained a forged or unauthorized signature or endorsement, or was not properly payable for any reason, then SPC may withhold the amount of the Financial Account Transaction from your Financial Account until the claim is finally investigated and resolved.
9.14   Liability Related to Financial Account Transactions.
You are responsible for all Financial Account Transactions on your Financial Account, whether or not they are authorized. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, the Stripe Parties will not be liable to you, your Affiliates or any third party for any losses, damages or costs arising out of or relating to:
(a) a failed Financial Account Transaction on your Financial Account, including if SPC decides to refuse to pay or decline any Financial Account Transaction or if a Financial Account Transaction fails due to circumstances outside of SPC’s control;
(b) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform completing a Financial Account Transaction or otherwise acting in reliance upon any incorrect or incomplete information provided or made available to SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform;
(c) SPC’s refusal to comply with your Stripe Connect Platform’s instructions under Section 7.3 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms; or
(d) any correspondent bank’s negligence or failure, or funds lost in transit.
9.15   Compliance with ERISA.
You represent on the date you first use the Stripe Treasury Services, and warrant at all times during the Term, that you do not loan funds to your Financial Account or otherwise deliver property to SPC on behalf of:
(a) an “employee benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA;
(b) a “plan” within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the IRS Code;
(c) an entity whose underlying assets constitute “plan assets” subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4974 of the IRS Code by reason of Section 3(42) of ERISA, U.S. Department of Labor Regulation 29 C.F.R. Section 25.10.3-101 or otherwise; or
(d) a “governmental plan” (as defined in ERISA or the IRS Code) or another type of plan (or an entity whose assets are considered to include the assets of a governmental plan or other plan) that is subject to any Law or restriction that is substantively similar or of similar effect to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRS Code.
You must promptly notify your Stripe Connect Platform if you breach this Section 9.15.
10. Fees and Security.
10.1 Fees.
(a)
Fee Disclosure
. Your Stripe Connect Platform is responsible for disclosing to you all applicable fees (if any) that apply to your use of the Stripe Treasury Services. Your Stripe Connect Platform will disclose those fees at the time you request access to the Stripe Treasury Services and will disclose any changes before they take effect.
(b)
Your Responsibility for Disputes
. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, you are liable to SPC for all losses, damages and costs that SPC incurs as a result of any dispute involving your Financial Account, including as a result of relying on your Stripe Connect Platform’s representations or instructions. You authorize SPC to (i) deduct these losses, damages and costs from funds in your Financial Account; or (ii) set them off in accordance with Section 10.1(c) of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms with or without prior notice to you.
(c)
Setoff
. SPC may deduct, recoup or setoff all fees you owe SPC (if any) from funds in your Financial Account, even if this would cause an overdraft. Alternatively, SPC may invoice you for some or all of those fees on a monthly basis in arrears, and you must pay the fees within 30 days after the date of the invoice.
10.2   Security Interest.
(a)
Grant of Security to SPC
. To secure debt that you owe to SPC, its Affiliates, or the respective service providers of each (if any, and including amounts owed to SPC that arose from overdrafts or drawn provisional credit under Section 9.7 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms), you grant SPC a first-priority security interest in, lien on and right of setoff against, all of your rights in (i) your Financial Account; (ii) the funds SPC holds on your behalf in the Custodial Account (if any); (iii) the interest or income (if any) arising from the Financial Account or the funds in that account, the property acquired with the Financial Account or those funds (if any), and all rights related to the Financial Account and those funds; and (iv) the funds in your Stripe Account (if any).  The debts that are secured by this security interest, lien and right of setoff include overdrafts and fees that you may owe in relation to your Financial Account, as well as amounts owed to SPC by another individual or entity if you have guaranteed that you will pay their debts. If a debt like this is due or overdue, SPC may use the funds in your Financial Account to pay all or part of that debt. The Law of the state in which the Treasury Bank is headquartered applies to the funds SPC holds on your behalf in the Custodial Account. SPC may file financing statements under the California Uniform Commercial Code to perfect this security interest in the places, in the form and to the extent it considers necessary or appropriate. SPC will have all the rights of a secured party under the California Uniform Commercial Code with respect to this security interest.
(b)
No Other Securities
. You must not grant a security interest in, lien on or right of setoff against, any collateral described in Section 10.2(a) of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms to any other individual or entity.
11. Restricting or Closing Your Financial Account.
11.1   Restricting Your Financial Account.
SPC may decline, delay, freeze or reverse a Financial Account Transaction or part of a Financial Account Transaction, restrict access to your Financial Account or information on your Financial Account, or remove funds from your Financial Account to hold them pending investigation to protect you, SPC or SPC’s Affiliates, or to comply with the Treasury Regulatory Requirements or other legal obligations. Examples of circumstances where SPC may exercise these rights include where:
(a) you maintain your Financial Account at $0 for at least 90 consecutive days;
(b) your Financial Account has been inactive for at least 12 months;
(c) you breach Section 8.4 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms;
(d) your Financial Account is involved in any Legal Process;
(e) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform receives conflicting information or instructions regarding ownership, control or activity of your Financial Account;
(f) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform suspects that you may be the victim of a fraud, scam or financial exploitation; and
(g) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform suspects that a Financial Account Transaction involving you or your Financial Account may involve illegal activity or may be fraudulent.
11.2 Replacement Financial Account.
SPC may transfer your Stripe Treasury Account Information and documentation to a replacement Financial Account and account number, including if your Financial Account is reported as compromised, or if SPC reasonably believes it is necessary to protect your Financial Account’s security. SPC may move SPC’s Custodial Accounts (and therefore your Financial Account) to a different financial institution.
11.3 Closing Your Financial Account.
(a)
By SPC
. SPC may close your Financial Account at any time for any reason upon notice to you or your Stripe Connect Platform.
(b)
By You
. You may close your Financial Account at any time by giving 30 days’ notice to your Stripe Connect Platform. During this 30-day period, you may transfer funds from your Financial Account in compliance with these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms.
(c)
SPC Can Keep Financial Account Open
. SPC is not required to close your Financial Account at your Stripe Connect Platform’s request if (i) you have pending Financial Account Transactions; (ii) there is an overdraft on your Financial Account; or (iii) your Financial Account is subject to Legal Process. In those cases, SPC may restrict your Financial Account against all future withdrawals, other than those made under Legal Process, until pending Financial Account Transactions are paid or returned, the account balance is no longer negative, and any legal restriction has been released. If your account balance is greater than $0, after SPC deducts fees, expenses, claims and other deductions that SPC has the right to make, SPC may require you to withdraw the remaining balance before SPC closes your Financial Account.
(d)
Consequences of Closing Financial Account
. After your Financial Account is closed, SPC has no obligation to accept funds into your Financial Account, process Financial Account Transactions through the Financial Account on your behalf, or satisfy any outstanding demands for payment. But, SPC may reopen your Financial Account if SPC receives funds payable to your Financial Account.
(e)
Access to Account History
. After your Financial Account is closed, SPC will enable your Stripe Connect Platform to provide you access to your Financial Account history for 60 days.
11.4 Adverse Claims.
If there are conflicting instructions with respect to your Financial Account or if there is any dispute regarding your Financial Account, then without limiting SPC’s rights under these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, SPC may refer the conflict or dispute to a court for resolution. If any person notifies SPC of a dispute, SPC does not need to decide if the dispute has merit before SPC takes further action. SPC may exercise any of these rights without notice to you.
12. Limitation of Liability.
To the extent that the Treasury Regulatory Requirements invalidate or render unenforceable any limitations or exclusions of liability of SPC and its Affiliates under this Agreement with respect to failing to stop payment on a Financial Account Transaction, or paying a Financial Account Transaction bearing an unauthorized or forged signature or endorsement, then the Stripe Parties’ aggregate liability with respect to those circumstances will be limited to the face value of the Financial Account Transaction.
13. Interpretation.
In these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, references to “business days” are to business days in the City of New York on which the Treasury Bank is open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its banking functions.

At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that the Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms are binding on the Connected Account. If Stripe believes that your existing acceptance process does not create a binding agreement between Stripe and the Connected Account, then, upon Stripe’s request, you must modify that process as Stripe requires;

“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.

To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

• sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
• affiliates from using your information to market to you
• sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See the Other Important Information section below for more information on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.

Cloudflare Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 28, 2024.
We have updated our July 18, 2024 Privacy Policy to update the contact email of our Data Protection Officer.
This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the personal information that Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.
CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE
Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.
We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information. We will only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
1. POLICY APPLICATION
This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:
Attendees
: Those who visit our offices or provide their information to Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, as well as those who participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Website Visitors
: Those who visit our Websites, including those who may opt to provide an email address or other contact information to receive communications from Cloudflare, fill out a survey, or provide feedback. For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites” refer collectively to
www.cloudflare.com
as well as any other websites Cloudflare operates for its own behalf and that link to this Policy. For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we serve as Registrar.
Customers
: Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Cloudflare (or its authorized partner) and to whom Cloudflare provides Services pursuant to such agreement. For purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall refer to all of the cloud-based solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Cloudflare or its authorized partners that are designed to increase the performance, security, and availability of Internet properties, applications, devices, and networks, along with any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made available in connection with the foregoing.
Administrative Users
: Those with login credentials for a Cloudflare account and/or those who administer any of the Services for a Customer. In some cases, an Administrative User and Customer may be the same individual. In other cases, an Administrative User may be an agent acting on behalf of a Customer.
Public DNS Resolver Users
: Those who use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 public recursive Domain Name System (“DNS”) resolver service, including 1.1.1.1 for Families ("1.1.1.1 resolver"). Learn more about the 1.1.1.1 resolver
here
.
End Users
: Those who (i) access or use our Customers’ domains, networks, websites, application programming interfaces, and applications, or (ii) Customers’ employees, agents, or contractors, who access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust end users.
Registrants:
Users of Cloudflare’s domain registrar services. Cloudflare is an
ICANN
-accredited registrar and complies with the
2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement
(“RAA”).
This Policy does not apply to “Application Users”—those individuals who use Cloudflare’s consumer-facing 1.1.1.1 Application. See the
1.1.1.1 Application Privacy Policy
for more information about the data collection and use practices for Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Application and the associated 1.1.1.1 Application Services.
This Policy also does not apply to our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.
Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen. Cloudflare does not knowingly collect or share personal information from any person under the age of eighteen. To the extent we become aware that we have the personal information of a person under the age of eighteen, we will delete that information.
When Cloudflare is a reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS records for websites using our Services. We are a conduit for information controlled by others. It is our Customers and their users who are responsible for the content transmitted across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics, etc.).
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT (Categories of Data Subjects)
Attendees
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We may ask for and collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you visit our offices, register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, or participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Image and voice
: When you participate in a Cloudflare study, we may ask for your permission to record your voice and/or image during your participation in the study.
Website Visitors
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We ask for and—at your option—collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from us. We may ask you to submit such personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Websites, including participation in surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, or studies, requesting customer support, submitting feedback, or otherwise communicating with us. We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.
Log files
: Just as when you visit and interact with most websites and services delivered via the Internet, when you visit our Websites, including the Cloudflare Community Forum, we gather certain information and store it in log files. This information may include but is not limited to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information, URLs of referring pages, and locale and language preferences.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
: We may use cookies and other information-gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such as providing us with information about how you interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing efforts. You may view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) in the footer of the Cloudflare homepage at cloudflare.com or in the banner displayed when you visit our Websites from certain countries (such as the European Economic Area and the UK). Note that if you disable cookies entirely, Cloudflare’s Websites may not function properly. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing activities and interests. In addition to exercising cookie choices through our “Cookie Preferences” or “Your Privacy Choices” links, if you do not want to have cookies and similar technologies used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking
here
(or if located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, click
here
). For more information about the cookies Cloudflare uses and your privacy choices, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Material contributed in Interactive Areas
: The Websites may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). If you choose to participate in any of these Interactive Areas, please be aware that any information that you post in an Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others who access it. If you wish to remove your personal information from any of our Interactive Areas, please see the Section 8, below.
Customers and Administrative Users
Customer Account Information
: When you register for an account, we collect contact information. Depending on subscription level, this contact information may include your Customer name, the email address(es) of your account administrator(s), telephone number, and addresses necessary to process payment and delivery of Services. In addition, when you use the Services, we collect information about how you configure your account and the Services (e.g., firewall settings for the domains you administer). We refer to all of this information collectively as “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. Customer Account Information is required to enable your access to your Cloudflare account and Services. By providing us with any personal information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us. We also maintain logs of Administrative Users’ activity (e.g., actions taken to configure settings in Customers’ account).
Payment information
: We do not require our Customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide payment and billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which payment method you choose. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or personal account numbers.
Crash Reports
: When our Services encounter an unexpected error, you may be asked to submit a crash report, which may contain personal information. You will have an opportunity to review the content of the report prior to submitting the report to us.
Public DNS Resolver Users
Limited DNS query data
: We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Our 1.1.1.1 resolver service does not log personal information, and the bulk of the limited non-personally identifiable query data is only stored for 25 hours. You can learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to privacy
here
.
Please note that our data handling practices for our 1.1.1.1 Application, which is not covered by this Policy, are somewhat different than our 1.1.1.1 resolver data handling practices and are described
here
.
End Users
Cloudflare processes End Users’ interactions with Customer’s Internet Properties and the Services. This information is processed when End Users access or use our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, devices, end points, and networks that use one or more of our Services, and when End Users access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust. The information processed may include but is not limited to IP addresses, traffic routing data, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from Customers’ websites, devices, applications, and/or networks.
The End User data that we make available to our Customers via the Service dashboard or other online interface are specifically defined as “Customer Logs”.
Registrants
Contact and domain information: We collect data such as domain name and status, contact information (such as name, organization, address, phone number and email address), name server, DNSSEC, and Form of Approval (i.e., full WHOIS capture at time of transfer into our system, including the IP address that initiated the transfer).
Network Data.
Cloudflare collects and stores Network Data, which are models, observations, reports, analyses, statistics, databases and other information created, compiled, analyzed, generated or derived by Cloudflare from server, network or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing the Service, including information required to help Cloudflare identify, analyze, mitigate, prevent, and block malicious activities on Cloudflare’s network. Examples of Network Data include service uptime and service availability metrics, request volumes, error rates, cache rates, origin and nature of malware, and IP threat scores.
3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Cloudflare only processes personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or authorized. As a general matter, for the categories of data described in Section 2 above, except 1.1.1.1 resolver user data as explained below, we may use your personal information to:
Provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote the Websites and Services for all users of the Websites and Services;
Enable you to access and use the Websites and Services;
Process and complete transactions, and send you related information, including purchase confirmations and invoices;
Send transactional messages, including responses to your comments, questions, and requests; provide customer service and support; and send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
Comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to the Services, and other illegal activities;
For other purposes for which we obtain your consent.
In addition, we may use the information we collect from Attendees, Websites Visitors, and Registrants, as well as Customer Account Information for the following purposes:

Public DNS Resolver Users
. We use information we collect from 1.1.1.1 resolver users to operate and improve the 1.1.1.1 resolver, such as to assist us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. Our 1.1.1.1 resolver service does not store 1.1.1.1 resolver users’ personal information. We will not combine any information collected from DNS queries to our 1.1.1.1 resolver with any other Cloudflare or third party data in any way that can be used to identify individual end users. Cloudflare may store aggregated data, as outlined within our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitments to privacy, indefinitely in order to power Cloudflare Radar and assist Cloudflare in improving Cloudflare services, such as, enhancing the overall performance of the Cloudflare Resolver and identifying security threats. Learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to privacy
here
.
Information from Third Party Services
. We may combine information we collect as described in Section 2 above with personal information we obtain from third parties. For example, we may combine information entered on a Cloudflare sales submission form with information we receive from a third-party sales intelligence platform vendor to enhance our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential Customers.
4. DATA AGGREGATION
Cloudflare may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers, Administrators, and End Users. For example, we may assemble data to determine how Web crawlers index the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity or to compile web traffic reports and statistics. Non-personally identifiable, aggregated data may be shared with third parties.
5. INFORMATION SHARING
We work with other companies who provide us with services that help run our business and the Cloudflare Service (“Service Providers”). These companies provide services to help us deliver customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact our existing Customers and Administrators as well as sales leads, provide marketing support, and otherwise operate and improve our Services. These Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to our instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy, the contracts we have in place with such Service Providers, and other applicable confidentiality, data protection, and security measures and regulations.
Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with them or to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to us.
In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we also may share your information with others in the following circumstances:
Within the Cloudflare Group (defined for the purposes of this Policy as Cloudflare, Inc. (United States) and its subsidiaries listed Section 15);
With our resellers and other sales partners who may help us distribute the Services to Customers;
With an app developer when you install an app from our App Marketplace;
In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business;
When we are required to disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. (Learn more about how we handle law enforcement requests
here
);
Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Website Terms of Use, Self-Serve Subscription Agreement, and/or Enterprise Subscription Terms of Service; or as otherwise required to comply with our legal obligations; or
As you may otherwise consent from time to time.

If you purchase a domain name from Cloudflare’s registrar service, ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and the relevant registry operators overseeing the domain’s top-level domain require us to collect registrant data for the purposes of domain registration and via the WHOIS protocol. We may also be required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant registry operators and other such providers with whom we contract in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon the legitimate request of third parties. Registrant data may include the domain name, registrant name and other contact information, and domain name server information. See our Domain Registration Agreement

6. NOTICE TO EU, UK, AND SWISS RESIDENTS
“Personal information” as referenced in this Privacy Policy means “personal data” as that term is defined under the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) and its United Kingdom (“UK”) GDPR counterpart. Cloudflare is a data controller for the personal information collected from all categories of data subjects listed above, with the following exceptions: Cloudflare is a data processor of Customer Logs, Administrative User logs, and some account settings information. In addition, Cloudflare is a data processor for any of the content provided by Customers and End Users through the Services that transits, or in some cases, is stored on, the Cloudflare network. Where Cloudflare is a data processor, Cloudflare processes data on behalf of its Customers pursuant to their data processing instructions.
If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK or Switzerland, please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Cloudflare Services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our legitimate interests. Please note that in most cases, if you do not provide the requested information, Cloudflare will not be able to provide the requested service to you.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object by emailing us at sar@cloudflare.com.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
7. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS
Cloudflare is a U.S. based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United States and the European Economic Area. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.
Whenever a Cloudflare company transfers personal information originating from one country to another Cloudflare group company or a third party service provider or partner in a different country, we will implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the territory from which the data is exported. We describe the safeguards we implement
here
. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to the United States, we rely on our certifications under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Should these certifications lapse or become otherwise invalidated, Cloudflare relies on the standard contractual clauses, including supplementary measures as necessary for transfers to the United States. We also use standard contractual clauses for other international transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.
Self-certification to the Data Privacy Framework
Cloudflare complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Cloudflare has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Cloudflare has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together, the “DPFs”), Cloudflare commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPFs should first contact us by emailing sar@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.
In compliance with the DPFs, Cloudflare commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPFs to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of TRUSTe, LLC are provided at no cost to you. You have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other mechanisms set out in this DPF Notice or our Privacy Notice.  For more information, please see Annex 1 of the DPF Principles, available
here
.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Cloudflare’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Cloudflare is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Cloudflare shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Cloudflare proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
8. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
Cloudflare  recognizes individuals’ data protection rights. You have the right to access, correct, update, port, or delete your personal information, and to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information (each of these a “Rights Request”). You may email us at sar@cloudflare.com with any Rights Request, and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers and Administrative Users also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at Cloudflare.com.
Please note that before we can complete your Rights Request, we will need to verify that your identity matches that of the data in which you are requesting to exercise your rights. You can expect a verification email under separate cover, to the email address associated with your personal information on file. If you are making a Rights Request on behalf of another individual as an authorized agent, we require that either (a) the data subject must verify their identity and directly confirm with Cloudflare they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the Rights Request, (b) the authorized agent must be provided power of attorney by the data subject in accordance with the law of the data subject’s jurisdiction, or (c) the Rights Request must otherwise be submitted in accordance with applicable privacy law.
For any Rights Request, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist. Where a Rights Request may implicate the personal information of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with Rights Requests to the extent required by applicable law or the Swiss-U.S. or EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. In the event that your Rights Request is denied, residents of the U.S. states Virginia and Colorado may appeal our decision by responding to the email informing them of the denial or by submitting a Rights Request to appeal to sar@cloudflare.com, and we will respond within sixty (60) days. In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Please note that we do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the Rights Requests described above. In addition, Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users. Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domain’s content. Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for Rights Requests in accordance with their obligations under applicable data protection laws. If an End User requests that we fulfill a Rights Request, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.
9. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
Cloudflare will send you commercial communications based on the communication preferences in your account settings. Cloudflare also will send you service-related communications. You may manage your receipt of commercial communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of such emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com.
10. DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS
We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access. We have put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
11. DATA RETENTION
We store your personal information for a period of time that is consistent with the business purposes set forth in Section 3 of this policy or as long as needed to fulfill and comply with legal obligations. The criteria we used to determine how long we store your personal information will vary depending on several different factors. We typically consider the following when determining data retention:
The purpose for collecting the personal information in the first place. For example, if you have an active account with us, we need to keep your contact information during the entirety of that time in order to provide you with support or contact you regarding your account;
The volume, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information we are processing;
The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information;

16. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA. It does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.
How We Collect, Use, and Share Your Personal Information under the CCPA
We may collect, use, and disclose for our business and commercial purposes, the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers for the categories of individuals/users defined in Section 1 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy (e.g., email address of Customers and Administrative Users, name and contact information of Attendees);
Payment and customer records information of our Customers;
Protected classification characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, race, languages spoken, or gender) to the extent these characteristics are voluntarily disclosed to us or contained in any  content transmitted across or stored on our network;
Commercial information (e.g., records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or usage histories);
Professional or employment information;
Internet or other electronic network activity information; and
Inferences (e.g., information about your interests or preferences).
The sources from which we collect information are described in Section 2 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The business and commercial purposes for which we collect and use this information are described in Section 3 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The categories of third parties to whom we “disclose” the information for a business purpose are described in Section 5 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
Your California Privacy Rights
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.
Knowledge
. You can request information about what personal information we have collected about you, including:
the categories of personal information;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.
Access
. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
Deletion
. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
Correction
. You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal information and, taking into account the purpose of processing the personal information, ensure it is complete;
Opt-out of sales or sharing
. You can ask that we do not “sell” or “share” your Personal Information as “sell” and “share” are explicitly defined under the CCPA. For more information, please refer to the section titled “Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information” below.
Nondiscrimination
. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you the Services; increasing the price/rate of the Services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.
In order to submit a request to exercise your right of information, access, or deletion pursuant to the CCPA, please follow the instructions for the submitting a Rights Request detailed in Section 8, above. Please note, we reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and may need to confirm your identity to process certain requests using the verification methods described in Section 8. For example, we take reasonable precautions to verify the identities of those California residents submitting requests to delete or access Personal Information.
Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information
Cloudflare does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use. Making Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information under the CCPA.
You can request to opt out of such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information using the “
Your Privacy Choices”
link in the footer below
.
In addition, some internet browsers offer the option to enable opt-out signals such as Global Privacy Control that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Cloudflare responds to these signals by processing them as a request to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information as discussed above.
Please note that you will still see some advertising, regardless of your selection. We do not impose verification protocols for processing opt out requests unless we have reason to question the authenticity of a requester’s identity, in which case we may request evidence of identity and California residency.
