Hey there! Welcome to Match’s Privacy Policy.
We know reading a privacy policy might not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but hear us out. We put a lot of effort into making this policy as clear and engaging as possible, because we actually want you to read it! Think of us as your digital wingmate, here to guide you through the ins and outs of what data we collect, and why and how we use it. So get cozy, grab your beverage of choice, and let’s dive into the world of personal data together.
This Privacy Policy applies from 09/08/2024. The previous version, available
here
, applies until then.

1. Who We Are
The company responsible for your data (the “data controller”) is:
Match.com International Limited
MATCH, DPO Office
27 Old Gloucester Street, London, United Kingdom, WC1N 3AX
Our Representative in the European Union is:
MTCH Technology Services Limited

2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies
This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the Match brand. Whether you’re searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our “service” in this Privacy Policy.
If for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy — not this Privacy Policy — will apply.
3. Data We Collect
It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service. We may also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Google or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you’re interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.
Data you give us

Description
Account Data
When you create an account, you give us basic information for your account to be set up such as email address, date of birth, password.
Profile Data
When you complete your profile, you share additional details about you, such as your gender, interests, preferences, approximate location, etc. Some of this data may be considered sensitive or special in certain countries, such as details about sexual orientation, health, racial or ethnic origins. If you choose to provide this data, you consent to us using it as laid out in this Privacy Policy.
Content
When you use our service, you may post photos, videos, audio, text and other types of content, such as your chats with other members.
Purchase Data
When you make a purchase, we keep the details of the transaction (e.g., what you purchased, the date of the transaction, and the price). The exact data depends on the payment method you choose. When you pay directly with us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide your debit or credit card number or other financial info.
Marketing, Survey and Research Data
We sometimes run (i) surveys, focus groups, or market studies for research purposes and (ii) promotions, events or contests for marketing purposes. When you choose to participate, you give us information to process your entry and participation, as well as your responses to our questions and your feedback.
Third-Party Data
When you choose to share with us information about other people (for example, if you use the contact details of someone you know for a given feature or if you submit a query or report involving a member), we process this data on your behalf to complete your request.
Customer Support Data
When you contact us, you provide us with information that may be necessary to help address your inquiry. Other people may also submit queries or reports involving you. Finally, our moderation tools and teams can collect additional data as part of their investigations. Further, we are part of the
Match Group family of businesses
. Match Group considers the safety and security of members a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your data may be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our service.
Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our members’ safety and security.
Social Media Data
You may decide to share data with us through your accounts on other platforms (e.g., Spotify, Google or Apple), for instance if you decide to create and log into your account via these platforms or if you decide to upload data such as playlists onto our service from these platforms.

When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries whose data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental bodies, we typically rely on what are called
standard contract clauses
. These standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data.

Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another member, such as a copy of any messages you received from them, the other member will have to make a request themselves.

9. How Long We Retain Your Data
We want the connections you make through our service to last forever, but we keep your personal data only as long as necessary for legitimate business reasons (as laid out in
Section 4
) and as permitted by applicable law.
If you decide to stop using our service, you can close your account and your profile will no longer be visible to other members. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for two years.
Following account closure, we delete your data as laid out below:
To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure. During this period, we keep your data to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of data during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.
We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data and imprecise location of purchase for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user may challenge the transaction, and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents members give us for five years to comply and evidence our compliance with applicable law.
We maintain limited data on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data 6 years from the date of the report in support of our safety efforts, to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data and imprecise location of download for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.
Finally, we maintain data on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep data in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.
Where and as legally permitted, we may maintain and use data that, by itself, cannot identify or be attributed specifically to you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to improve our service, create new features, technologies and services, and keep Match Group services safe.

11. Privacy Policy Changes
This policy may change over time. We’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations of our data practices remain up-to-date.
