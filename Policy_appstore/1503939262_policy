International Data Transfers
We may send the personal data of individuals in the EEA/UK/CH to third countries, including the United States, where it may be stored or processed, for example on our service providers’ cloud servers. When we transfer personal data, we rely either on Adequacy Decisions as adopted by the European Commission (EC), the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) on the basis of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, UK-US Data Bridge, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework agreements, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) issued by the EC or the FDPIC, or International Data Transfer Agreements (IDTAs) approved by the ICO. Data protection authorities have determined that the SCCs and IDTAs provide sufficient safeguards to protect personal data transferred outside the EEA/UK/CH.
