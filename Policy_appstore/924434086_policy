5. The Personal Data We Process

We do not knowingly process any other data relating to children.
We also collect, use and share
Aggregated Data
such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.
Aggregated Data
may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your
Usage Data
to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect
Aggregated Data
with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with products or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
6. Sensitive Data
In certain situations we have to collect Sensitive Data about you. Under data protection law this is known as "special category" data and includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, and information about your health and genetic and biometric data.
When do we process Sensitive Data?
We only collect and process Sensitive Data where you provide such information to us in the following situations:
As part of any feedback and/or complaints which you raise with us, for example where you believe you have suffered a
health issue
following a visit to one of our venues (for example, suspected food poisoning or another health and safety incident), or where you believe we have been
discriminatory
against you (for example, discrimination based on race or sexual orientation). When you provide details of what happened, this may include giving us Sensitive Data. We are allowed to process this Sensitive Data (together with any other relevant information), to investigate, address and resolve your issue and to administer any possible legal claims or out-of-court procedures. We may process Sensitive Data relating to children in the situations set out in Section 7.
Where you are
applying for a job
with us. In this situation, we can process your Sensitive Data because it is necessary for carrying out our obligations and rights related to employment law and your working capacity; this is covered in a separate Candidate Privacy Policy which is displayed when you apply for job, and a copy of it can be provided by emailing data.protection@mbplc.com. We do not routinely collect and process Sensitive Data in any other situations. If we do, we will obtain your explicit consent.
7. Children's Data
Children need particular protection where their data is collected and processed. We may collect and process Children's Data in certain situations as described below.
When do we process Children's Data?
We only collect and process Children's Data in the following situations:
for enquiring about, and booking,
children's parties and events
. When you fill out forms relating to the event you may choose to provide us with children's names, ages and dietary requirements
where you believe you have suffered a
health issue
following a visit to one of our venues (for example, suspected food poisoning or another health and safety incident), or where you believe we have been
discriminatory
against you (for example, discrimination based on race or sexual orientation) where children have been involved in these situations. Again, you might provide us with children's names, ages and health information;
where a child aged 13 or above
logs into our WiFi network
, we collect Identify Data, Contact Data, Technical Data, and Usage Data (however, only customers aged 18+ can register for a customer account with us).
We are allowed to process Children's Data where it is required for our legitimate interests (offering and hosting children's parties and other events in our venues, dealing with feedback and complaints, understanding how customers interact with our mobile apps and websites, providing safe and secure use of our online facilities) or whenever required to comply with a legal obligation; and, in any of these situations, where the processing is necessary.
Alternatively, or in addition, we may process Children's Data on the basis of
consent, given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility
(and in these circumstances we will always make reasonable efforts to verify such consent).
8. Profiling
We do, from time to time, process personal data about you in an automated way to evaluate certain personal aspects about you, including to enable us to analyse and make predictions about your interests and how you are likely to interact with our Group. This is commonly referred to as profiling and it is our way of providing you with a more bespoke customer experience based on how we think you engage with us and our Group.
The personal data about you that we process for profiling purposes includes your Identity Data, your Contact Data and your Profile Data. We do not process personal data about you for profiling purposes that consists of Special Category Personal Data. We process your personal data for profiling purposes for our legitimate interests as set out below. Click
here
if you would like to learn more about exactly the kind of profiling we do and what profiling means to you. You also have the right to object to us processing your personal data for profiling; to learn more about your right to object, click
here.
How We Profile and the Logic We Use
We collect your personal data from several sources, including directly from you, which we then combine in order to create a view of your interactions with our group of companies. Once we have this record, we match multiple variables that are unique to you (such as name, email, postcode and/or mobile number) to create an overall matched record. We then clean the record by comparing it with certain third-party reference files (such as the Post Office Address File, the Bereavement Register and email validation) to try to ensure that the record is as accurate as possible.
Once the record is cleaned, we add the record to our customer database and we start to build a behavioural profile about you, which details the brands that you do, or do not, engage with. We also infer a visit to a particular brand location so that we can gain a better understanding of how far you might travel to visit a particular brand of ours. In addition, we apply our algorithms or scoring models to the record to indicate how likely it will be that you will visit a particular brand in the future. We then segment our overall database to create a customer base for each brand to determine those customers with a high likelihood to visit a brand and those who are unlikely to visit a brand. Your record may be in more than one segmented element of the database, for example, you may be high likelihood for 3 of our brands and low likelihood for 2 of our brands within your catchment area.
As well as looking at how you interact with our brands, we also apply demographic profiles (provided to us by a third party supplier of demographic data) to your record using your postcode. These profiles are trends based on a nationally representative sample. This enables us to understand your likely profile such as age, home and financial situation as well as your attitudes to family, home life, matters such as dining, media consumption or your purchasing behaviour.
Finally, to ensure that you get the most relevant communications from us, we may use the above variables (if you have agreed to us sending you certain communications) to select an appropriate communication for you to receive, as well as ensuring the you receive the right content or offer. For example, our profiling will help us determine whether you may be more interested in a family message and offer as opposed to a champagne promotion. We enhance this information with data we have regarding the communications and promotions that you have (or have not) engaged with in the past.
Significance and Consequence of the Profiling
The profiling we do enables us to better understand how you interact, or may interact, with our brands. It enables us to provide you with the most relevant information (such as vouchers and offers where you have agreed to receive these) and to determine whether a particular brand or outlet should be more tailored to those people who do, or who are likely to, visit it. The profiling also helps us to improve our services and the offerings of our brands depending on the demographic of existing or future visitors.
9. How We Collect Your Personal Data

We cannot run our business or provide many of the services and benefits you expect to receive without involving other people and businesses. We only share your information in accordance with the laws applicable to us and for the purposes set out above.
We share your personal data with:
All of our
Group
including new companies, brands or outlets we might acquire in the future (acting as controllers or processors) who are all based in the EEA and who provide IT, HR, system administration services and for whom you may have agreed can provide you with marketing communications.

In the case of food delivery services, we will share personal data with suppliers of delivery services, including Roofoods Limited (trading as Deliveroo), which includes details relating to your identity, contact details, order details including billing details, and delivery location and instructions. Delivery partners also act as a data controller of your personal data. In respect of Roofoods Limited (trading as Deliveroo), you can access their privacy policy at

We also may share the information we collect with
other third parties
where we are legally obliged to do so; for example, to comply with a court order.
12. International Transfers
Some of our external third parties are based outside of the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

We only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
We will use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in the EEA.
Where we use third parties based in the US, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection for personal data shared between the EEA and the US.

14. Our Retention of Your Personal Data
We can only keep your personal data for as long as necessary for the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
The precise length of time we hold your personal data for varies depending on the individual circumstances, but in determining the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
We regularly review our retention periods to ensure that we are not keeping your data for longer than necessary. Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available by contacting us.
15. Your Rights
In certain circumstances, you may have the right to request access, transfer, rectification and/or erasure of the personal data that we process about you. You may also have the right to object to and/or restrict our processing of your personal data. Details of the rights are set out below.
Human intervention:
you may request human intervention where a decision has been made about you based solely on automated processing, and/or you may challenge that decision (this may happen in the context of our recruitment process where we collect information relating to whether or not a candidate has unspent criminal convictions).
Access:
you may request access to your personal data, which enables you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and to check to see if we are processing it lawfully.
Transfer:
you may request that we transfer your personal data to you or a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Rectification:
you may request rectification of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Erasure:
you may request erasure of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object:
you may object to how we are processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Restriction:
you may request that we restrict how we process your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Withdrawal of Consent:
where we have relied on your consent to process your personal data you will have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
