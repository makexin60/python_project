Australia & New Zealand Privacy Supplement
Effective April 14, 2023
In addition to Deere's global Enterprise Privacy Statement, the following terms apply to personal information that a Deere Group Member, including John Deere Limited, John Deere Financial, Chamberlain Holdings Limited, Wirtgen Australia Limited, Waratah New Zealand Limited, Waratah Forestry Equipment Pty. Ltd., Waratah Forestry Services Ltd, and Wirtgen New Zealand Limited, collects in New Zealand or Australia. "Deere Group Members" or "Deere" means John Deere and its controlled affiliates. "We" means the Deere Group Member that actually collects your personal information. If we intend to refer to a particular Deere Group Member, we mention that company's full name. For the purposes of the Privacy Supplement we note that “personal information” as referred to herein is “Personal Data” for the purposes of our Enterprise Privacy Statement and has the meaning given to it in the Australian
Privacy Act 1988
(Cth) or New Zealand
Privacy Act 2020
(as applicable).
Data Collection, Use and Disclosure
Information regarding how we collect personal information, the kinds of personal information that we collect and hold and the purpose for which we collect, hold and use personal information is described in sections 1 through 4 of our Enterprise Privacy Statement. These sections apply equally to personal information collected, held, used and disclosed in Australia or New Zealand. We only use your personal information as described therein, or in any collection statement provided to you at the time of collection, and for related secondary purposes permitted under Applicable Law.
From time to time and in accordance with our obligations under Applicable Law in Australia and New Zealand you may be provided specific collection notices regarding personal information collected from you. These notices supplement our Enterprise Privacy Statement and this Supplement and provide further information specific to the particular circumstance or context of collection.
You may limit the personal information you provide to us. You should be aware, however, that if you choose not to provide certain personal information, this may affect our ability to process your application, fulfil your request, or provide you a service or product.
When you provide the personal information of third parties to us (for example when providing the contact details of proposed guarantors, references or joint owners), you confirm that you are authorised to provide all such information to us and that you have provided that third person with notice of the matters prescribed in this Supplement and our Enterprise Privacy Statement.
Overseas Data Disclosure
We may disclose your personal information to a Deere Group Member, or to a John Deere dealer and other third-party data processors or service providers, which may be located in jurisdictions outside of Australia and New Zealand (as applicable), including the United States of America, Canada, the European Union (particularly Germany), India or Singapore. Further, as and where applicable, your personal information may be disclosed by a Deere Group Member between Australia and New Zealand. As set out in our Enterprise Privacy Statement, John Deere takes all appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information is made in accordance with Applicable Law. This includes, as and when necessary and applicable, taking reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient complies with the Australian Privacy Principles or New Zealand Information Privacy Principles.
Data Security
Personal information, other than personal information collected by John Deere Financial ("JDF") is held by Deere at 400 19th Street, Moline, Illinois 61265, USA. Personal information JDF collects is held by JDF at 166-170 Magnesium Drive, Crestmead, Queensland 4132, Australia. All personal information collected from Australia and New Zealand is subject to technical and organizational security measures more fully described in section 7 of our Enterprise Privacy Statement.
Direct Marketing
Where we use your personal information to send you marketing and promotional information you will be provided with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such information. Unless you exercise your right to opt-out of such communication, you will be taken to have consented to receive similar information and communications in the future.
Your rights under Applicable Law
Under Australian and New Zealand privacy law, you are entitled to access personal information that we hold about you and may request that we correct any errors in the information we hold. If you would like to access or correct your personal information held by us, please contact us at the contact details below.
We will take steps to allow you to access your personal information unless reasonable circumstances exist that would prohibit us from doing so. We will correct your personal information where we are satisfied that the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. As set out in our Enterprise Privacy Statement, when permitting access or correction of your personal information we will need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity and that the personal information we hold relates to you, which may include confirmation with third parties.
If you wish to complain about a failure by a Deere Group Member in Australia or New Zealand to comply with the Australian Privacy Act 1988 or New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and applicable privacy and information principles, please contact:

California Privacy Statement
Last updated: December 2023
In addition to your rights in the
John Deere Enterprise Privacy Statement
, California law provides for additional rights for California consumers, employees, and job applicants. You have the right to request a description of the categories and specific pieces of Personal Data about you we have collected and the categories of Personal Data about you that we may disclose for a business purpose to third parties, along with a description of the categories of third parties that may receive that Personal Data. We do not sell your Personal Data.
You also have the right to request that we correct or delete Personal Data about you that we have collected from you. Personal Data that is needed to complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, perform our contract(s) with you, or that was reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or that we can otherwise retain under applicable law, may not be deleted. You have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data in a portable format. The Personal Data we collect, use and share is further explained in our
Enterprise Privacy Statement
.
Certain Personal Data we collect may be considered "sensitive information" under California privacy laws. Examples may include Social Security number, driver's license number, financial account number, routing number, citizenship or immigration status, and precise geolocation. We use this sensitive information for the purposes set forth in the How We Use Personal Data (the "Purposes") section of our Enterprise Privacy Statement. We do not sell your sensitive information. You have the right to request that we limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive information.
You may exercise your rights by calling us at 1-844-972-2272 (CCPA), through our
Data Subject Rights Request Form
or by mailing your request to Privacy Manager, Center for Global Business Conduct, Deere & Company, One John Deere Place, Moline, Illinois 61265-8089. We will ask you to verify your identity to fulfill these requests.
If you wish to use an authorized agent to submit a request, we will need to verify the authorized agent by confirming that the original requestor has given written permission. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on their behalf.
Please be advised that any California consumer, employee, or job applicant that exercises a right under the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act will not be treated differently or discriminated against for exercising these rights.
This notice is not an agreement. This notice may be amended by us from time to time by updating this notice.
