EE Privacy Centre
Privacy Policy
Welcome
As a communications provider, using personal information is fundamental to what we do – from connecting calls to developing and promoting our services. We believe that it is very important that our customers trust us with their personal information.
This privacy notice explains what personal information we collect about you and how we use it during our relationship with you. You can also find details of what rights you have (including the right to object to some of the data handling we carry out), as well as how to exercise those rights in the
Your Rights
section below.
Technology is a fast-changing area and can be complicated. We’ve included a
Glossary
which explains the meaning of any technical terms we use.
Where we use the words “We” or “Our” we mean either British Telecommunications plc or EE Limited – both part of the BT Group.
This privacy notice explains how we use the personal information collected from or about you when you are one of our customers or when you contact us or use our services.
The company that is responsible for your personal information will be the company that is named in any terms and conditions or messages sent to you.
In some circumstances BT plc and EE Ltd are jointly responsible for deciding what personal information is collected, used and stored.  This happens where we work together to give you the best customer experience and to be more efficient across our businesses to:
Provide assistance through our customer service teams;
Understand how people interact with us;
Understand how people use our products and services; and
Carry out checks for fraud and credit risk.
We will also share your personal information with other companies in the BT Group. You can find out more details about this in the
Sharing Your Information
section below.
This notice applies to the products and services we provide you (such as mobile, TV and broadband), your use of our apps and our websites and where we pass your details on to insurance or finance providers as part of your payment for our products or services.
It also applies even if you’re not one of our customers, but you interact with us as part of us running our business, for example by:
Using one of our products or services – paid for by someone else
acting with authorisation on behalf of one of our customers
taking part in a survey or trial
entering a prize promotion
calling our helpdesk
generally enquiring about our services
If you need to give us personal information about someone else in relation to our products and services, this privacy notice will also apply to their information. If we need the permission of the other person to use that information, we’ll ask you to check they are OK with this.
We have separate privacy notices in the BT Group that apply if you buy products or services directly with other companies in the group or if you are a business customer (which applies if you are a sole trader, partnership, or company). You can find links to our other BT Group privacy notices below:
Plusnet PLC
Openreach
Business customers -
BT plc
and
EE Limited
This notice doesn’t cover other third-party companies or organisations collecting and using your personal information to provide you with products and services, including those who use cookies, tags and other technologies to offer relevant online advertisements to you. You can find more details about how those third parties use your data by visiting their privacy notices on their own websites. You should review their privacy notices before giving them your information.
In a nutshell
We’ve also created a
short version of the entire policy
, so you can get all the facts at a glance.
Your Rights
You can ask us to provide you with a copy of your personal data at any time. If you have given us your personal information because you have a contract with us or because you have consented to us handling it, you are entitled to ask us for a copy of this information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format so that you can reuse it or share it with other organisations.
In some circumstances (including where we rely on ‘legitimate interests’), you have the right to object to our processing of your data and can ask us to restrict our use of your data and to delete it.  You also have the right to ask us to correct your information if it’s inaccurate and, as described below, to object to automated decision making.
We aim to provide our products and services in a way that protects information and respects your request. Because of this, when you delete or change (or ask us to delete or change) your information from our systems, we might not do so straight away from our back-up systems or copies on our active servers. And we may need to keep some information to fulfil your request (for example, keeping your email address to make sure it’s not on our marketing list).
Where we can, we’ll confirm any changes. For example, we’ll check a change of address against the Postal Address File, or we might ask you to confirm it.
There are some exceptions to these rights, for example we might not be able to delete your data if we need it to fulfil your contract or we are required to keep it by law. We also might not be able to provide you with information if it would infringe someone else’s rights. We’ll always try to help you with your request and if we believe we are unable to fulfil your request we will always explain why.
Where you have given consent for us to handle your personal information or permission to provide a service, you can change your mind and withdraw this consent at any time. It only applies to how we use your personal information in the future, not what we’ve done in the past (for example if we’ve run a credit check at the start of your contract).
You can exercise any of your rights by using the
online forms here
.
Once we’ve looked at your request, we’ll let you know when you can expect to hear from us. It will normally take us up to one month to complete your request, but it could take longer (up to a further two months) if it’s a complicated request or you send us a lot of requests at once.
If you want a copy of your
billing information
, the quickest way to access this information is by logging into your EE account or, for your mobile billing information, by calling 150 from your mobile and we’ll send it to you (you must be the account holder to ask for this information.) If you want to see what contact information we hold about you, you can also log in to your account. It’s quick and simple to access it this way.  If you would like to request any other personal information you can do this by clicking the link above.
If you want us to stop using personal information we’ve collected via
cookies
on our website or apps, you should either
change your cookie settings
or change the settings for your app.
You can change your
marketing preferences
by following the
unsubscribe link
in any email or text marketing that we send you.
Alternatively, you can also
unsubscribe by completing our web form
or by giving us a call. Please contact us on
0330 1234 150
to let us know whether you’re happy to hear from us by email, text, post or telephone.
You can use the same contact details to let us know whether you want us to stop using information about how you use our products and services (including your
call, browser
and
TV records
) for marketing purposes or profiling you for marketing purposes.
Children
We only enter into contracts with customers who are over the age of 18. Although the account holder will always be an adult, we recognise that some of our products and services, like mobile devices, will be purchased on behalf of children and so we cannot guarantee that every mobile number or service is held by an adult.
Where you have purchased a product or service on behalf of a child we will collect and use the child’s data as part of providing our services to the end user in line with this privacy notice. We have developed safety features for devices that belong to a child as well as educational material to help keep your child safe online. You can find
more information on these features here
and some
guidance to help you stay safe online
.
Information we collect about you and how we use it
The personal information we collect, store and use will depend on the products and services you have with us and how you use them. In most cases we have this information because we collect it directly from you, or because it has been derived from your use of our products and services. In some circumstances we will obtain this information from a third party.
Some of the personal information we collect, store and use is considered more sensitive (for example data about health or biometric data).  We will only collect, store and use this more sensitive information to support you and your use of our products and services, and only where we put additional measures in place to protect this personal information.
Below you can find details of how and why we use your information and our permitted reason in law (known as ‘legal basis’) to use it. For some products and services, we handle additional information. You can find specific details by looking at the section for the product or service you’ve bought and see an overview in the ways in which we collect and use your personal information during our relationship.
When you create an account, we will collect details about you so we can identify you and contact you about your account. As you buy different products and services or contact us these details will be linked to your account so we have a clear record of your relationship with us.

We use the advertising tools of online platforms to advertise our products (e.g. Facebook custom audiences).  For that purpose, we may provide your email address to the online platform in hashed form for them to present sponsored adverts.
When you submit information on our website and have accepted cookies, or when you buy a product in an EE store, we’ll also share your details in hashed form with our online platforms partners to match and compare sales records, optimise campaigns and target other users with similar profiles to yours. They can only match your details to help us if you already have an account with them. See our

When we use the advertising tools of these online platforms, we are both responsible for your information and sometimes act jointly in making decisions about your data while using these tools. You can ask these companies directly about their use of your data.  See their privacy notices for more details.
Sometimes, we use supplier tools to find likely matches of customers on our database (at an aggregated level) with those of our trusted publisher partners. Sharing the results from this process allows our partners to identify customers we may have in common so we can show more relevant advertising when you're using their platforms, sites or apps. These partners may also use their own techniques to identify additional customers of theirs who share similar characteristics to any group we are targeting to help extend the reach of our personalised advertising.

We understand that some customers may need additional help and support from us. We want to ensure that we are here for you and so have in place processes to support those customers who may have additional needs.
Where you have told us that you have additional needs when you purchase a product or service from us, through your interactions with us during our relationship with you (for example if you tell an advisor of your change of circumstances), or if a family member, or carer provides this information on your behalf, we record this to tailor our services to those needs.

Before we provide you with a product or service (including upgrades or renewals), or sometimes when you use our products and services, we’ll use the personal information you have given us together with information we have collected from credit reference agencies (such as Experian or Equifax), and fraud prevention agencies (such as TransUnion) to carry out credit and fraud checks.
If we, a credit reference or fraud prevention agency (such as TransUnion), decide that you are a credit, fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have asked for, or we may stop providing existing services to you.
If you give us false or inaccurate information which we identify as fraudulent, we’ll pass that on to fraud prevention agencies. We might also share it with law enforcement agencies, as may the agencies we have shared the information with.

Substantial public interest
Where we process details that are considered to be sensitive, we do this under the lawful basis of substantial public interest
How credit reference and fraud prevention agencies use your information:
There are different credit reference agencies in the UK (for example, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian). Each one might hold different information about you. If you want to find out what information they have on you, they may charge you a small fee.
Whenever credit reference and fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal information outside of the UK, they place contractual responsibilities on the organisation receiving it to protect your information to the standard required in the UK. They may also make the organisation receiving the information subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ aimed at sharing information securely.You can find more information on how they use your personal information by reading their privacy notices. Here are the links for each of the three main Credit Reference Agencies.
TransUnion
Equifax
Experian
When credit reference agencies receive a search from us, a 'footprint' goes on your file which other organisations might see when they carry out a credit check.
The credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will keep a record of any fraud or money laundering risk and this may result in other organisations refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us using the details below.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your information can be held by us and the organisations we share it with for up to six years.
Linked accounts
If you tell us you’re associated with someone else financially (for example, by marriage or civil partnership), we’ll link your records together. You must make sure you have their agreement to share information about them. The agencies we share the information with also link your records together and these links will stay on your and their files – unless you or your partner successfully asks the agency to break that link.
If you don’t become one of our customers, we’ll still keep the result of our credits checks about you if we have a legal obligation and it’s in our legitimate interests to help prevent or detect fraud.
We might also share the information with other organisations. We do this because it’s in our, and the organisations’, legitimate interests to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to check identities, to protect our business and to keep to laws that apply to us.
We use your information to prevent and detect attacks on our network or against your equipment.  This helps protect our business, our customers and the wider public.

Sharing your information
We share your personal information with other companies within the BT Group for administrative purposes. We have a group-wide arrangement, known as binding corporate rules, to make sure your personal information is protected, no matter which company in the BT Group holds that information.
We share your personal information with other organisations for the following reasons:
With our insurance providers, for example if there is a claim made against us
With credit reference agencies and collection companies to carry out fraud and credit checks and collect debts
With third parties whose products and services we market to you (where you have given consent to receive such messages)
With third parties whose products you have bought from us as an add-on to your broadband or mobile service, or by setting up a subscription in our subscription manager
With our third party finance provider if you purchase EE Finance
With the insurance underwriter, Chubb European Group SE, if you purchase insurance products from us
With other communications companies (for example where you switch provider)
With local authorities and alarm providers to identify vulnerable customers affected by the
All-IP Programme
and the switch to
Digital Voice
With the Department of Work and Pensions to check if you’re eligible for our social tariffs
With other organisations, such as spam detection or operating system providers, for the purposes of fraud prevention
If you enter into a handset and airtime agreement or consumer credit agreement with us, we may need to share details of that agreement and its administration with our third-party finance provider for reporting purposes
We may also share your information:
With any public authority or law enforcement agency (if they ask for it)
To comply with law or regulations, or for possible legal proceedings
If there's an emergency and we think you or other people are at risk (including for example with the Environment Agency for flood warnings or if you call the emergency services we’re required to give them information about where you are)
If there’s a change in who owns us or any of our assets, we might share personal information to the new (or prospective) owner and our advisors.
When we share your information with other organisations we’ll make sure it’s protected, as far as is reasonably possible.
We use other providers to carry out services on our behalf or to help us provide services to you.
We also use them to:
provide customer-service, marketing, infrastructure and information-technology services;
personalise our service and make it work better;
process payment transactions;
analyse and improve the information we hold (including about your interactions with our service);
assist with fraud prevention and detection; and
run surveys
Where we use another organisation, we still control your personal information. And we have strict controls in place to make sure it’s properly protected.
BT Group
is a large multinational organisation. Our
binding corporate rules
reflect how we operate and make sure we respect your rights and keep your information safe no matter which company in the BT Group is handling that data.
After the UK and wider EU, India and the Philippines are where most of our processing of personal information takes place. Your personal information is used for customer or IT support or operations purposes in these countries.
If we use third party service providers to assist us in handling your data, we may need to transfer your personal information to a country that doesn’t have the same protections as the UK.  We make sure we have approved contracts in place with our suppliers who are operating outside the UK so that they are required to keep your data safe.
Automated decision making and profiling
We want to make sure decisions we make about you such as credit approval or which product or service to offer you are quick, fair and correct based on what we know about you. We use technology to make decisions automatically and to build profiles about you. This technology uses logic that analyses your preferences and how you use our products and services, which helps us to improve your customer experience, making it more relevant for you and allowing you to get the most out of our products and services. This means you’ll regularly receive from us personalised content whether in our marketing emails or when you browse our app or website or watch TV.
We also use technology to make decisions automatically based on your credit score analysis, which allows us to guarantee your regular payments for our products and services. This means we’ll decide your eligibility for our products and services based on your credit history.
You have the right to object to our use of automated decision making in some circumstances. Please remember that if you object to certain types of automated decision making, it may affect our ability to provide you with the optimum level of customer service and our ability to provide you with certain products, financing and services.
Please see
Your Rights
section above for more information on how to object.
Protecting your information and how long we keep it

Otherwise, we delete it. You can ask us for specific information on retention periods using the details below.

Who we are
This Policy applies to all companies in the BT group that provide services to businesses and explains what personal information EE collect, use, share and otherwise process (as a data controller), about you. Where we say “BT group” we mean all our brands, including EE in the UK.
The company that is the controller of your personal information, that is, that decides the purposes for which it is processed and how, will generally be the company that you deal with as named in any terms and conditions or messages sent to you. The other companies in the BT group who are the potential controllers of your personal information under this Policy are set out in our
BT Controllers List
.
In some circumstances, more than one controller may be responsible for processing your personal information, such as when personal information is shared with other BT group companies as set out in this Policy. If you are unsure who the controller is for the processing of your personal information, please contact us using the details set out in the “
How to contact us and further details
” section.
Additionally in the UK, there may be instances where BT plc and EE Ltd are jointly responsible for deciding what personal information is collected, used and stored about our UK business customers.  This happens where we work together to give you the best customer experience and to be more efficient across our businesses to:
Provide assistance through our customer service teams;
Understand how  business customers interact with us; and
Understand what products and services business customers purchase and how they use our products and services
This privacy notice has been written in line with our obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 as they apply in the UK. Depending on where you are based there may be local law requirements within and outside the UK which apply instead.
What is covered by this policy?
This Policy applies to personal information we hold about you:
where the BT group of companies (“
we
” or “

where you obtain products and services from one of our Business Customers as their customer
where we resell third-party products or services to you
where you work for or provide services to a Business Customer, and
where you work for or provide services to a business or organisation which we do business with, for example, where we engage your business as a supplier.
This Policy explains what personal information we collect about you, how we use it and when we may share your personal information. It also describes your data protection rights, including a right to object to some of the processing which we carry out. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in the “
Your rights to see your personal information and limit our use of it?
” section. Please note this Policy doesn’t apply to the information we hold about companies or organisations (except for sole traders).

How we use personal information, and our legal grounds for doing so
We use your personal information for a variety of purposes related to the products and services that we provide to you or procure from you. We have set out an explanation of this below.
Where required by local law in relation to any particular type of data, EE will rely on consent for data collection, cross border transfers and sharing data with third parties as applicable.
Provision of the services
For the purposes set out below, generally, the legal basis that we rely on is that the processing is necessary to take steps at your request before entering into a contract or to perform a contract or to comply with our legal obligations. Otherwise, the legal basis is that it is in our legitimate interests to process the personal information because we have a legitimate interest in providing our products and services, contacting our customers with important notices or updates, responding to our customer queries and complaints, running, improving, and preventing harm to our business, enforcing contracts, and operating as an efficient and effective business.
Purpose

Relevant categories of personal information
Provision of products and services
We use personal information to provide you with our products and services, send you product or service-information messages (e.g. confirm your order and tell you about any changes that might affect your service), manage your account and respond to your queries and complaints (including troubleshooting).
In relation to our suppliers, we use personal information to receive and monitor anything you supply to us and administer our contract.
We may also share your personal information with providers of products and services where we resell their products or services to you, or to another communications provider if you’re buying some services from them and us.
Where you use our mobile network, we use your personal information to enable you to send and receive Rich Communication Services (“RCS”) messages from a compatible Apple device. We will share your personal information with our partner, Google, who provides the RCS service to you.  See Google’s privacy notice for more information about how they handle your data.

To run credit and fraud prevention checks on Business Customers and suppliers
For the purposes below, the legal basis that we rely on is that it is our legitimate interests to process the personal information in order to prevent harm to our business and to operate as an efficient and effective business.
Before we provide you with a product or service (including upgrades or renewals), or sometimes when you use our products and services, we’ll use the personal information you have given us together with information we have collected from credit reference agencies (such as Experian or Equifax in the UK) to carry out credit and fraud checks.
If we or a credit reference decide that you are a credit, fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have asked for, or we may stop providing existing services to you.
If you give us false or inaccurate information which we identify as fraudulent, we’ll pass that on to fraud prevention agencies. We might also share it with law enforcement agencies, as may the agencies we have shared the information with.
You can find more information on how credit reference agencies use your personal information by reading their privacy notices. Here are the links for the main Credit Reference Agencies:
Equifax
Experian
When credit reference agencies receive a search from us, a 'footprint' goes on your file which other organisations might see when they carry out a credit check.
The credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will keep a record of any fraud or money laundering risk and this may result in other organisations refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us using the details below.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your information can be held by us and the organisations we share it with for up to six years.
As part of running credit and fraud prevention checks using your personal information, decisions may be made by automated means.  This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct, or is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. You have rights in relation to automated decision making, if you have any questions about this please contact us using the details below.

When we use the advertising tools of these online platforms, we are both responsible for your information and sometimes act jointly in making decisions about your data while using these tools. You can ask these companies directly about their use of your data.  See their privacy notices for more details.
Sometimes we use supplier tools to find likely matches of customers on our database (at an aggregated level) with those of our trusted publisher partners. Sharing the results from this process allows our partners to identify customers we may have in common so we can show more relevant advertising when you’re using their platforms, sites or apps. These partners may also use their own techniques to identify additional customers of theirs who share similar characteristics to any group we are targeting to help extend the reach of our personalised advertising.
To fulfil legal obligations
In some cases, we will need to use your personal Information to fulfil a legal obligation.
We might have to release personal information about you to meet our legal and regulatory obligations, including to data protection authorities. For example, if you are in the UK and you call the emergency services using our services, we are required to give them information about where you are.
Under investigatory powers legislation, we might have to share personal information about you with government and law-enforcement agencies, such as the police, to help detect and stop crime, prosecute offenders, and protect national security. You can
read more about our approach to investigatory powers on our website
We might have to process call data records to comply with local electronic communications legislation.
For regulatory reasons
We’ll also use your call records and IP address to find the best way of routing your communications through the various parts of our network, equipment and systems as required by our regulator and to provide the service.
Automated decision making
For our UK customers, we use technology to make decisions automatically and to build profiles about you. This technology uses logic that analyses your preferences and how you use our products and services, which helps us to improve your customer experience, making it more relevant for you and allowing you to get the most out of our products and services. This means you’ll regularly receive from us personalised content whether in our marketing emails or when you browse our website.
You have the right to object to our use of automated decision making in some circumstances.  Please remember that if you object to certain types of automated decision making, it may affect our ability to provide you with the optimum level of customer service and our ability to provide you with certain products and services.
Sharing your personal information
We may share personal information with others as follows. Where required by local law in relation to any particular type of data, EE will rely on consent for sharing data with third parties.
The BT group
We may share your personal information with other companies within the BT group
for the purposes described in the
Business privacy policy
and where there is a legal basis to do so.
We will ensure that the personal information shared will be consistent with any permissions you have given (e.g. whether or not you wish to receive marketing communications) and any other controls you exercise with regard to our processing of your personal information (e.g. where you have chosen to opt-out of certain processing).
In relation to how we protect this personal information when we transfer it to another country, please see the section below on International transfers.
Other third party service providers
We use other providers to carry out services on our behalf or to help us provide services to you. These include to provide customer-service, infrastructure and information technology services, process payment transactions, conduct marketing and sales, administer promotions and competitions, conduct research, measurement and analytics, and derive insights.
Where we use another organisation, we still control your personal information. And we have strict controls in place to make sure it’s properly protected. In relation to how we protect this information when we transfer it to another organisation for processing in another country, please see the international transfers section below.
AdTech Providers

Change of ownership
If there’s a change (or expected change) in who owns us or any of our assets, we might share personal information with the new (or prospective) owner. If we do, they’ll have to keep it confidential.
Law enforcement bodies, the authorities, and courts
Where necessary, we disclose personal information for the prevention, investigation or prosecution of criminal activities, and in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a regulator, government authority or law enforcement body’s request.
International transfers
The BT group is a large multinational group of companies which operates internationally. Some of the processes involved in our use of your personal information will require your personal information to be stored or processed in countries outside the country where you are located. This may include countries where the level of legal protection is different to where you are based and where you may have fewer legal rights. Where this happens, we will take the following steps to comply with the law and ensure adequate protection of your data whether transferred to a BT or non-BT company. Where required by local law in relation to any particular type of data, BT will rely on consent for cross border transfers.
Transfers of UK/EEA personal data to BT group companies
To make sure your personal information is protected no matter which company in the BT group holds that personal information, we have a group-wide arrangement, known as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). Our BCRs cover any transfers of personal information intra-group within the BT group, and any transfers from our customers to a BT entity (which is protected by the UK/EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)). There is one set of BCRs for transfers of data out of
the UK
and another for transfers out of
the European Economic Area (EEA)
.
Transfers to a non-BT company
If we transfer personal information to a company that is not in the BT group, we will put in place an appropriate transfer mechanism as required by local law, such as, in the case of a transfer out of the EEA or the UK, the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses.
If you’d like information about the documents we use to protect your personal information when it’s transferred outside your region or country, please contact us.
Protecting your information and how long we keep it
How do we protect your personal information?
We have strict security measures to protect your personal information, and standards for how we classify and handle personal information. We check your identity when you get in touch with us, and we follow our security procedures and apply suitable technical measures, such as encryption, to protect your Information.
How long do we keep your personal information?
In broad terms, we will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Policy. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of information and the reason that we have collected the information. For example, some information related to the provision to you of our products will be kept for a number of years in order to comply with various telecommunications, finance and tax related legal obligations.
We have detailed internal retention policies that set out the various retention periods for different categories of information, depending on our legal obligations and whether there is a commercial need to retain it. After a retention period has lapsed, the personal information is securely deleted, unless it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
For further information regarding applicable retention periods, please contact us using the details set out below.
Your rights to see your personal information and limit our use of it
Subject to local data privacy laws, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, as set out below.
Right
Description
Right to access data
You can request confirmation as to whether or not we are processing personal information concerning you and (where this is the case) access to the personal information and certain other information about the processing.
Right to correct data
You can request that we correct any errors in any personal information we hold about you.
Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)
You can ask for your personal information to be deleted. In some cases, we might keep information that you have asked us to delete. This could be for legal or regulatory reasons, so that we can keep providing our products and services where these are still required, or for another legitimate reason. For example, we keep certain billing information to show we have charged correctly. But we’ll always tell you why we keep the information.
If you want us to stop using personal information we’ve collected via cookies on our website or apps, please refer to the relevant cookie policy on the site you are visiting.
Right to portability
The right in some cases to receive your personal information in a digital format or to have it transmitted directly to another controller (where technically feasible).
Right to object to processing, including marketing
The right to object (on grounds relating to your particular situation) to the processing of your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests, including for direct marketing purposes. You can opt out of receiving marketing from us using the unsubscribe link in the email or opt-out code in the SMS we send you.
Alternatively, if you are a UK customer, you can give us a call on 0800 956 6100 to let us know whether you’re happy to hear from us by email, text, post, or telephone.
You may also let us know if you want us to stop using information about how you use our products and services for marketing purposes or profiling you for marketing purposes.  For more information about how we use your information for marketing purposes, please see above.
Right to withdraw consent
You can withdraw your consent at any time in respect of any processing which is based upon your consent.
To exercise these rights, you can do the following:
If you want a copy of your billing information, the number to call as business customer is 0800 956 6100 or call 150 from your EE phone.
If you want to see what contact information we hold about you, you can also log in to your account. It’s quick and simple to access it this way.
If you want a copy of the information we hold about you, or you would like to ask us to correct, complete, delete or stop using any personal information we hold about you, you can contact us
here
.
If you work for one of our corporate customers, where possible, please ask your employer – they’ll ask for this on your behalf.
Please contact us
here
or see
our list of controllers
for further ways to contact us in some specific territories
.
We will assess any request to exercise these rights on a case-by-case basis and we may ask you for proof of identity or other information before doing so.
There may be circumstances in which we are not legally required to comply with a request because of relevant exemptions. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain your information even if you withdraw your consent.
We aim to provide our products and services in a way that protects personal information and respects your request.  Because of this, when you delete or change your information from our systems (or ask us to), we might not do so straight away from our back-up systems or copies on our active servers. And we may need to keep some information to fulfil your request, for example, keeping your email address to make sure it’s not on our marketing list.
Where we can, we’ll confirm any changes. For example, we’ll check a change of address against any authoritative postal address file, or we might ask you to confirm it.
We’ll always try to help you with your request. But we may refuse all or part of your request if sharing the information would have a negative effect on others, for example because it includes personal information about someone else, or the law prevents us from doing so.
It will normally take us up to one month to get back to you but could take longer (up to a further two months) if it’s a complicated request or we receive a lot of requests at once.
How will we tell you about changes to this policy?
Our Policy might change from time to time. We will take reasonable measures to communicate any substantial changes we make to this Policy, for example, by posting an update on our websites, or sending you an updated version of the Policy.
How to contact us and further details
