Walabok LLC developed this app as a free service. This service is provided by Walabok LLC at no charge and is intended for use as is.
This page is intended to inform users about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for those who choose to use our service.
By using our service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information we collect is used to provide and improve the service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible via our service, unless otherwise defined here.
Information Collection and Use
To enhance your experience while using our service, we may request certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to device type, operating system version and type, unique identifiers (such as iOS Advertising ID or Android ID), carrier, and other related information (collected through methods such as mobile "SDKs") for that device. We may collect and share this information through methods like mobile "SDKs." This information may be used independently, aggregated, or combined with mobile identifiers and shared with third parties for purposes related to advertising, attribution (measuring ad performance), analytics, and research (e.g., Google AdMob, Google Firebase). The information we request is stored on your device and is not directly collected by us.
The app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from websites you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory.
This service does not explicitly use "cookies." However, the app may incorporate third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to accept or refuse these cookies and to be notified when a cookie is sent to your device. Refusing cookies may limit your ability to use certain parts of this service.
