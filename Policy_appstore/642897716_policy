Preliminary section: Main amendments
As a trusted companion, the protection of your personal data is important to the BNP Paribas Group. We have enhanced this Privacy Notice by being more transparent on the following information on:
processing activities relating to commercial prospection
processing activities relating to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, and international sanctions (freezing of assets)
Introduction
We take the protection of your personal data very seriously; accordingly, the BNP Paribas Group has adopted strong principles in its Personal Data Protection Charter available at
BNP Paribas - Personal Data Privacy Charter (group.bnpparibas) .
.
BNP Paribas Fortis SA ("We"), as controller, through our brands (BNP Paribas Fortis, Fintro and Hello Bank!) are responsible for collecting and processing your personal data in relation to its activities.
Our business is to help all our customers – individuals, entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized enterprises, large companies and institutional investors – in their day-to-day banking activities and in achieving their projects thanks
                to our financing, investment, savings and insurance solutions.
As a member of an integrated banking-insurance Group in collaboration with the various entities of the Group, we provide our customers with a complete range of financial and insurance products and services.
The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to explain how we process your personal data and how you can control and manage them.
Further information may be provided where necessary at the time of collection of your personal data.
1. Are you subject to this Privacy Notice?
This Privacy Notice applies to you if you are ("You"):
one of our customers or in a contractual relationship with us (e.g., as a guarantor or co-borrower);
a member of our customer’s family and/or household. Indeed, our customers may occasionally share with us information about their family when it is necessary to provide them with a product or service or to get to know them better;
a person interested in our products or services when you provide us with your personal data (in an agency, on our websites and applications, during events or sponsorship operations) so that we can contact you.

2. How can you control the processing activities we do on your personal data?
You have rights which allow you to exercise real control over your personal data and how we process them. We draw your attention to the fact that these rights may be limited where regulations so provide. This is the case with the regulations
                relating to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, which prohibit us from allowing you to exercise your various rights with regard to your personal data processed for this purpose.
If you wish to exercise the rights listed below, please submit a request by post addressed to BNP Paribas Fortis SA – Data Privacy Office – 1GA2W, Montagne du Parc/Warandeberg 3, 1000 Brussels or via Easy Banking Web or App

In this context, we are joint controllers with BNP Paribas SA, the parent company of the BNP Paribas Group (the term "We" in this section also includes BNP Paribas SA).

.

respond to your requests and assist you;
assist you in the management of your budget by the automatic categorization of your transaction data;

3.3. Your personal data are processed to fulfil our legitimate interest or that of a third party

                legitimate interest pursued by a processing activity, please contact us using the contact details provided under section 2 "HOW CAN YOU CONTROL THE PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE DO ON YOUR PERSONAL DATA?” above.

                    interactions with you such as phone recordings, e-mails or chats, using these interactions to train our staff).
Carry out financial operations such as debt portfolio sales, securitizations, financing or refinancing of the BNP Paribas Group.
Conduct statistical studies and develop predictive and descriptive models for:
commercial purposes: to identify the products and services that could best meet your needs, to create new offers or identify new trends among our customers, similarities in behaviour, to develop our commercial policy taking into
                            account our customers’ preferences, to derive observations (e.g. aggregated consumption patterns) that we can offer in the market;
scientific and related purposes : to contribute to academic projects as well as to private and public projects including micro- or macro-economic analysis for the benefit of the Society in particular;

3.3.2. We use your personal data to send you commercial offers by electronic means, post and phone
As part of the BNP Paribas Group, we want to be able to offer you access to the full range of products and services that best meet your needs.
Once you are a customer and unless you object, we may send you these offers electronically for our products and services and those of the Group if they are similar to those you have already subscribed to.
We will ensure that these commercial offers relate to products or services that are relevant to your needs and complementary to those you already have to ensure that our respective interests are balanced.
We may also send you, by phone and post, unless you object, offers concerning our products and services as well as those of the Group and our trusted partners.
3.3.3. We analyse your personal data to perform standard profiling to personalize our products and offers
To enhance your experience and satisfaction, we need to determine to which customer group you belong. For this purpose, we build a standard profile from relevant data that we select from the following information:
what you have directly communicated to us during our interactions with you or when you subscribe to a product or service;
resulting from your use of our products or services such as those related to your accounts including the balance of the accounts, regular or atypical movements, the use of your card abroad as well as the automatic categorization of your
                    transaction data (e.g., the distribution of your expenses and your receipts by category as is visible in your customer area);
from your use of our various channels: our websites, applications and social networks (e.g., if you are digitally savvy, if you prefer a customer journey to subscribe to a product, or service with more autonomy (selfcare));
Unless you object, we will perform this customization based on standard profiling. We may go further to better meet your needs, if you consent, by performing a tailor-made customization as described below.
3.3.4. We record electronic communications data
In addition to recordings of electronic communications permitted or required by law or to which you have consented, we may record electronic communications to which you are a party, including traffic data, in the course of lawful business

train and monitor our employees and improve the quality of our services;
provide evidence of business transactions or dealings that have taken place in the course of those electronic communications, including the content of those communications (including any advice we give).
We retain records of electronic communications for as long as required or permitted by law, including for the period in which a dispute relating to those communications may arise.
This applies to both telephone conversations and electronic communications (such as e-mails, SMS, instant messaging or other similar technology) that you have with our call centre, (independent) branches, private banking and business centres,
                dealing rooms or one of our representatives.
3.4. Your personal data are processed if you have given your consent
For some processing of personal data, we will give you specific information and ask for your consent. Of course, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
In particular, we ask for your consent for:

any electronic offer for products and services not similar to those you have subscribed to or for products and services from our trusted partners;

processors which perform services on our behalf e.g., IT services, logistics, printing services, telecommunication, debt collection, advisory and distribution and marketing.
banking and commercial partners, independent agents, intermediaries or brokers, financial institutions, counterparties, public services, trade repositories with which we have a relationship if such transmission is required to allow us
                    to provide you with the services and products or execute our contractual obligations or transaction (e.g., banks, correspondent banks, depositaries, custodians, issuers of securities, paying agents, exchange platforms, insurance companies,

For transfers to non-EEA countries where the level of protection has not been recognized as adequate by the European Commission, we will either rely on a derogation applicable to the specific situation (e.g., if the transfer is necessary to
                perform our contract with you, such as when making an international payment) or implement one of the following safeguards to ensure the protection of your personal data:
Standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission;
Binding corporate rules.
To obtain a copy of these safeguards or details on where they are available, you can send us a request using the contact details provided under section 2 “HOW CAN YOU CONTROL THE PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE DO ON YOUR PERSONAL DATA?”.
