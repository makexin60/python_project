(“JAMS”) pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”) and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The seat of arbitration shall be in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California.
For Australian residents the arbitration will be administered by the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (“ACICA”) in accordance with the ACICA Arbitration Rules. The seat of arbitration shall be the State of Queensland, Australia. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the applicable rule-making authority or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow these Terms of Use and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms of Use, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
GOVERNING LAW
You agree that, unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute that may arise between you and Princess Polly or our affiliates.  The parties agree and hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the appropriate state and federal courts located in the state of California, with respect to such matters.
If you are a resident of Australia, these Terms of Use will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Queensland, Australia, without regard to conflicts of law principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that jurisdiction.
Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Website must be filed or otherwise commenced within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS
You may use the Website only for lawful purposes. The Website and use of our services is subject to, and you agree that you will at all times comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances and the like applicable to the use of the Website.

WAIVER & SEVERABILITY
The failure of Princess Polly to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of this Terms of Use by Princess Polly must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Princess Polly. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
TERMINATION
Princess Polly may terminate this Terms of Use agreement or access to the Website at any time, or any portion thereof, with or without notice, for any reason.

Termination of these Terms of Use shall not limit Princess Polly from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor shall such termination relieve your obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by you under these Terms of Use. Any provision of these Terms of Use which expressly or by its nature survives termination or expiration, or which contemplates performance or observance subsequent to termination or expiration of these Terms of Use, will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms of Use and continue in full force and effect thereafter. We may retain and use the information about your use of the Website as set forth in our Privacy Policy and our other policies.
ASSIGNMENT

FORCE MAJEURE
Princess Polly shall not be liable to you for any delay or failure to perform obligations hereunder or under the Terms of Sale if such delay or failure arises from any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of Princess Polly. Such causes shall include, but are not limited to, acts of God, acts of governmental authority, floods, fires, loss of electricity or other utilities, or delays by you in providing required resources or support or performing any other requirements.

HOW WE STORE AND SECURE YOUR INFORMATION
In Short
:
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure, however, no system can be completely secure and transmissions over the internet are never entirely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we cannot guarantee your information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Any such transmission of information by you is at your own risk.
We do our best to provide you with a safe and convenient shopping experience. We have put in place a wide variety of technical and organizational security measures to help protect you and the personal information we collect about you.
We use reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your information from unauthorized use, access, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. We endeavor to protect the personal information we receive, gather and store, by such means as password protection, firewalls and other means. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to access it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We also require that third party service providers acting on our behalf or with whom we share your information also provide appropriate security measures in accordance with industry standards. We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
Please note that we will never email you asking for account information like your username, date of birth, credit card information, or other personal information. Finally, we will never email you with attachments that can be opened. If you received a suspicious email that appears to be from us, please contact us

WHERE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS HELD
Princess Polly is a global company with a global footprint, but the majority of the Personal Information that we collect is stored in the United States.  Your personal information may be subject to the laws of the countries in which it is stored or used. By providing us with any personal information, you understand that your information may be transferred, processed, or stored outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have a different data protection regime from the country in which you reside, as further described in the Data Transfers Outside the United States Section below. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal information. Non-United States based customers can read more about this topic below.
DATA TRANSFERS OUTSIDE OF THE United States
Princess Polly is headquartered in the United States and operates globally and utilizes service providers both in the United States and throughout the world. As such, Princess Polly and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. To bring you our Website, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the country where we originally collected your personal information, for example:
●
With our offices outside the country where such personal information is collected;
●
With you and our service providers located throughout the world; or
●
Where there is an international dimension to the services we are providing to you.
These transfers may be subject to special rules under local data protection law.
These outside countries do not have the same data protection laws as the country where we originally collected the personal information. In particular, you are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. We will, however, ensure the transfer complies with data protection law and all personal information will be secure. If you are located outside the United States, we will only transfer your personal information if:
●
you provide your explicit consent;
●
the country to which the personal information will be transferred has been granted an appropriate adequacy decision by your local supervisory authority; or
●
we have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the transfer, for example we have entered into the appropriate standard contractual clauses and required additional safeguards with the recipient, or the recipient is a party to binding corporate rules approved by a supervisory authority.
Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, by using the Website or our products or services, you consent and authorize Princess Polly and its service providers to transfer, store, and use all such information in the United States and any other country where we operate which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the country where you reside and to the processing of that information by us and our service providers on our and their servers located in the United States and any other country where we operate as described in this
Privacy Policy. If you do not want your personal information transferred to the United States or any other country where we operate, please do not submit any information to us or use our Website or our products or services.
If you would like further information, please contact us (see the “Contact Information” Section below).
Information Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as needed to provide the service to you (for example, as long as you have an online account with us) or as needed to fulfill our own obligations, such as preventing fraud, meeting legal or other regulatory requirements, resolving disputes, improving our services or maintaining security, and in each case, as consistent with applicable law.
Different retention periods apply for different types of personal information. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of personal information; the potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information; the purpose(s) for which we use or may use the personal information; whether we can achieve the purpose(s) through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.
When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete it or we may anonymize it.
If we anonymize or de-identify information, we will maintain and use the information in anonymized or de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the information except as required or permitted by law.
We may retain non-personal information that has been sufficiently aggregated or anonymized for a longer period.

We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not address, the privacy practices of other third parties, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, or any other app developers, social media platforms, operating system providers, wireless or telecommunications service providers, or device manufacturers.

We have no control over, and are not responsible for this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.

The right to be provided with a copy of your personal data (the right of access).
Right to Rectification
The right to require us to correct any mistakes in your personal data.
Right to be Forgotten
The right to require us to delete your personal data —in certain situations.
At your request, we will delete your personal data promptly if:
it is no longer necessary to retain your personal data;
you withdraw the consent which formed the basis of your personal data processing;
you object to the processing of your personal data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for such processing;
the personal data was processed illegally; or
the personal data must be deleted for us to comply with our legal obligations.
We will decline your request for deletion if processing of your European Personal Data is necessary:
to comply with our legal obligations;
in pursuit of a legal action;
to detect, predict and monitor fraud; or
for the performance of a task in the public interest.
Right to Restriction of Processing
The right to require us to restrict processing of your personal data —in certain circumstances, e.g. if you contest the accuracy of the data, if your personal data was processed unlawfully and you request a limitation on processing, rather than the deletion of your personal data, we no longer need to process your persona data, but you require your personal data in connection with a legal claim, or you object to the processing pending verification as to whether an overriding legitimate ground for such processing exists.
We may continue to store your European Personal Data to the extent required to ensure that your request to limit the processing is respected in the future.
Right to Data Portability
The right to receive the personal data you provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or transmit that data to a third party—in certain situations. At your request, we will provide you free of charge with your European Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if:
you provided us with personal data;
the processing of your personal data is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract; or
the processing is carried out by automated means.
Right to Object
The right to object:
at any time to your personal data being processed for direct marketing (including profiling);
in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal data, e.g. processing carried out for the purpose of our legitimate interests.
We will comply with your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your rights and freedoms, or where the processing is in connection with the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Please note that even if we stop all marketing communications, you may still receive administrative communications from us.
Right Not to be Subject to Automated Individual Decision-Making
The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, unless you have given us your explicit consent or where they are necessary for a contract with us.
Right to withdraw consent
You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time.
For further information on each of those rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on individual rights under the General Data Protection Regulation.
While we hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information, the GDPR also gives you right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred. The current list of supervisory authorities who may be contacted are provided

CANADA’S PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) provides consumers who are Canadian residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your rights under PIPEDA and explains how to exercise those rights.
●
You have a right to know how your personal information will be used. We will explain why we need your personal information before or when we collect it, if the purpose is not already clear.
●
We will collect Personal Data only for the purposes we’ve identified or for the primary uses described in our Privacy Policy. We shall collect information by fair and lawful means only.
●
We will not use or disclose your Personal Data other than for the purposes for which it was collected unless we receive your consent or unless we are required or permitted to by law.
●
We will keep your personal information only for as long as we need it for the purposes identified in our Privacy Policy, as required by law, or as necessary to resolve any disputes you may have concerning our Website or services. We will follow internally set guidelines and use care in the disposal, destruction, or de-identification of personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to such personal information.
●
We will maintain accurate, complete and up-to-date personal information as required for the identified purposes associated with its collection. Please let us know if your contact or other personal information changes.
●
Upon your written request, and subject to exceptions as permitted or mandated by law, we will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information and will give you access to that personal information. You may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and have it amended as appropriate.
We maintain procedures for addressing and responding to all inquiries or complaints from you about our handling of personal information. We will inform individuals who make inquiries or lodge complaints of the existence of relevant complaint procedures. We may seek external advice where appropriate before providing a final response to individual complaints. We shall investigate all complaints. If a complaint is found to be justified, we will take appropriate measures, including, if necessary, amending our policies and procedures.
HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS.
If you would like to exercise any of your rights as described in the Privacy Policy or this Notice, please:
●
Complete a data subject request form available on our Website
HERE
;
●
Email us at
privacy@princespolly.com.
Please note that you may be restricted on the number of data access or data portability disclosures you may make within a 12-month period.
If you choose to contact us to exercise any of your rights as described in the Privacy Policy or this Notice, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. In order to help protect your privacy and maintain security, you will need to provide us with:
●
Enough information to identify you (e.g., your full name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date, or customer or matter reference number);
●
Proof of your identity and address (e.g., a copy of your driving license or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill); and
●
A description of what right you want to exercise and the information to which your request relates.
In addition, if you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request.
You may use a representative, called an "authorized agent," to submit a request to us.
In some states, an authorized agent must be a natural person, or a business entity registered with the appropriate Secretary of State, that you have authorized to act on your behalf.
In order to protect your privacy, Princess Polly requires you to confirm that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request and you must provide the authorized agent with signed permission. "Signed" means that the written attestation, declaration, or permission has either been physically signed or provided electronically pursuant to the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. In California, an authorized agent that has power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code section 4121 to 4130 must submit proof of statutory power of attorney, but in such cases, consumer verification will not be required.
Princess Polly may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized to act on your behalf. Requests submitted by an authorized agent will still require verification of the person who is the subject of the request in accordance with the process described above.
We are not obligated to make a data access or data portability disclosure if we cannot verify that the person making the request is the person about whom we collected information or is someone authorized to act on such person’s behalf.
Any personal information we collect from you to verify your identity in connection with your request will be used solely for the purposes of verification.

They prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensure that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases select advertisements that are based on your interests.

HOW WE STORE AND SECURE YOUR INFORMATION
In Short
:
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure, however, no system can be completely secure and transmissions over the internet are never entirely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we cannot guarantee your information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Any such transmission of information by you is at your own risk.
We do our best to provide you with a safe and convenient shopping experience. We have put in place a wide variety of technical and organizational security measures to help protect you and the personal information we collect about you.
We use reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your information from unauthorized use, access, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. We endeavor to protect the personal information we receive, gather and store, by such means as password protection, firewalls and other means. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to access it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We also require that third party service providers acting on our behalf or with whom we share your information also provide appropriate security measures in accordance with industry standards. We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
Please note that we will never email you asking for account information like your username, date of birth, credit card information, or other personal information. Finally, we will never email you with attachments that can be opened. If you received a suspicious email that appears to be from us, please contact us
.
WHERE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS HELD
Princess Polly is a global company with a global footprint, but the majority of the Personal Information that we collect is stored in the United States.  Your personal information may be subject to the laws of the countries in which it is stored or used. By providing us with any personal information, you understand that your information may be transferred, processed, or stored outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have a different data protection regime from the country in which you reside, as further described in the Data Transfers Outside the United States Section below. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal information. Non-United States based customers can read more about this topic below.
DATA TRANSFERS OUTSIDE OF THE United States
Princess Polly is headquartered in the United States and operates globally and utilizes service providers both in the United States and throughout the world. As such, Princess Polly and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. To bring you our Website, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the country where we originally collected your personal information, for example:
●
With our offices outside the country where such personal information is collected;
●
With you and our service providers located throughout the world; or
●
Where there is an international dimension to the services we are providing to you.
These transfers may be subject to special rules under local data protection law.
These outside countries do not have the same data protection laws as the country where we originally collected the personal information. In particular, you are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. We will, however, ensure the transfer complies with data protection law and all personal information will be secure. If you are located outside the United States, we will only transfer your personal information if:
●
you provide your explicit consent;
●
the country to which the personal information will be transferred has been granted an appropriate adequacy decision by your local supervisory authority; or
●
we have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the transfer, for example we have entered into the appropriate standard contractual clauses and required additional safeguards with the recipient, or the recipient is a party to binding corporate rules approved by a supervisory authority.
Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, by using the Website or our products or services, you consent and authorize Princess Polly and its service providers to transfer, store, and use all such information in the United States and any other country where we operate which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the country where you reside and to the processing of that information by us and our service providers on our and their servers located in the United States and any other country where we operate as described in this
Privacy Policy. If you do not want your personal information transferred to the United States or any other country where we operate, please do not submit any information to us or use our Website or our products or services.
If you would like further information, please contact us (see the “Contact Information” Section below).
Information Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as needed to provide the service to you (for example, as long as you have an online account with us) or as needed to fulfill our own obligations, such as preventing fraud, meeting legal or other regulatory requirements, resolving disputes, improving our services or maintaining security, and in each case, as consistent with applicable law.
Different retention periods apply for different types of personal information. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of personal information; the potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information; the purpose(s) for which we use or may use the personal information; whether we can achieve the purpose(s) through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.
When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete it or we may anonymize it.
If we anonymize or de-identify information, we will maintain and use the information in anonymized or de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the information except as required or permitted by law.
We may retain non-personal information that has been sufficiently aggregated or anonymized for a longer period.

We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not address, the privacy practices of other third parties, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, or any other app developers, social media platforms, operating system providers, wireless or telecommunications service providers, or device manufacturers.

website if you have any complaints, claims, concerns or questions regarding such third party
website or its privacy practices.

We have no control over, and are not responsible for this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
CHILDREN AND OUR SITE
Our Website is not directed to children, and you may not use our Website if you are under the age of 16.

The right to be provided with a copy of your personal data (the right of access).
Right to Rectification
The right to require us to correct any mistakes in your personal data.

Please note that even if we stop all marketing communications, you may still receive administrative communications from us.
Right Not to be Subject to Automated Individual Decision-Making
The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, unless you have given us your explicit consent or where they are necessary for a contract with us.
Right to withdraw consent
You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time.
For further information on each of those rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on individual rights under the General Data Protection Regulation.
While we hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information, the GDPR also gives you right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred. The current list of supervisory authorities who may be contacted are provided

CANADA’S PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) provides consumers who are Canadian residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your rights under PIPEDA and explains how to exercise those rights.
●
You have a right to know how your personal information will be used. We will explain why we need your personal information before or when we collect it, if the purpose is not already clear.
●
We will collect Personal Data only for the purposes we’ve identified or for the primary uses described in our Privacy Policy. We shall collect information by fair and lawful means only.
●
We will not use or disclose your Personal Data other than for the purposes for which it was collected unless we receive your consent or unless we are required or permitted to by law.
●
We will keep your personal information only for as long as we need it for the purposes identified in our Privacy Policy, as required by law, or as necessary to resolve any disputes you may have concerning our Website or services. We will follow internally set guidelines and use care in the disposal, destruction, or de-identification of personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to such personal information.
●
We will maintain accurate, complete and up-to-date personal information as required for the identified purposes associated with its collection. Please let us know if your contact or other personal information changes.
●
Upon your written request, and subject to exceptions as permitted or mandated by law, we will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information and will give you access to that personal information. You may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and have it amended as appropriate.
We maintain procedures for addressing and responding to all inquiries or complaints from you about our handling of personal information. We will inform individuals who make inquiries or lodge complaints of the existence of relevant complaint procedures. We may seek external advice where appropriate before providing a final response to individual complaints. We shall investigate all complaints. If a complaint is found to be justified, we will take appropriate measures, including, if necessary, amending our policies and procedures.
HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS.
If you would like to exercise any of your rights as described in the Privacy Policy or this Notice, please:
●
Complete a data subject request form available on our Website
HERE
;
●
Email us at
privacy@princespolly.com.
Please note that you may be restricted on the number of data access or data portability disclosures you may make within a 12-month period.
If you choose to contact us to exercise any of your rights as described in the Privacy Policy or this Notice, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. In order to help protect your privacy and maintain security, you will need to provide us with:
●
Enough information to identify you (e.g., your full name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date, or customer or matter reference number);
●
Proof of your identity and address (e.g., a copy of your driving license or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill); and
●
A description of what right you want to exercise and the information to which your request relates.
In addition, if you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request.
You may use a representative, called an "authorized agent," to submit a request to us.
In some states, an authorized agent must be a natural person, or a business entity registered with the appropriate Secretary of State, that you have authorized to act on your behalf.
In order to protect your privacy, Princess Polly requires you to confirm that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request and you must provide the authorized agent with signed permission. "Signed" means that the written attestation, declaration, or permission has either been physically signed or provided electronically pursuant to the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. In California, an authorized agent that has power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code section 4121 to 4130 must submit proof of statutory power of attorney, but in such cases, consumer verification will not be required.
Princess Polly may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized to act on your behalf. Requests submitted by an authorized agent will still require verification of the person who is the subject of the request in accordance with the process described above.
We are not obligated to make a data access or data portability disclosure if we cannot verify that the person making the request is the person about whom we collected information or is someone authorized to act on such person’s behalf.
Any personal information we collect from you to verify your identity in connection with your request will be used solely for the purposes of verification.
