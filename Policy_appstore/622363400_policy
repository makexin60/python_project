Right to withdraw consent
- Where the processing is based on your consent you have a right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before such withdrawal. Please however note that in case such processing is also pursuant to other legal basis like our legitimate interest or legal obligation or contractual performance or a necessity for entering into contract, and such legal basis continues to hold good, the processing will be continued despite such withdrawal of the consent. Subject to the above, consequences of withdrawal will be communicated to you on contacting us and on your agreement, your request for withdrawal will be processed.
AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
If you apply to us for a product, your application may be processed by an automated decision-making process which may carry out credit and affordability assessment checks to determine whether your application will be accepted. Where these automated processes suggest that your application should be rejected, we may manually review your application before making a final decision.
We may also use automated processes to decide credit limits. We may also carry out automated anti-money laundering and sanctions checks. This means that we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if the processing reveals your behavior to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers, is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk: (i) we may refuse to provide the services you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you; and (ii) a record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services or employment to you.
You expressly acknowledge that the automated decision is necessary for entering into or performance of contract and/or you explicitly consent to such automated decision making, hence you subject yourself to the decisions which are solely based on automated processing. You have rights in relation to automated decision making: if you want to know more please contact us using the details set out in the Contact Us section.
Additionally, under the provisions of the GDPR, you also have the right to request from the controller, the access to, rectification and erasure of personal data, right to restriction of processing concerning your personal data, right to data portability, and right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory Authority as per the provisions thereof.
We will verify your identity when you exercise these rights. For exercising your rights and getting information about any limitations which apply on them, you can reach out to us at the contact details given below.
