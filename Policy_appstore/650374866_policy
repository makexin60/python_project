        needed to Antonio Ferraioli''s app to work, and to provide leaderboards
        and online games (data stored on this database is private, encrypted and
        never shared with anyone).
Antonio Ferraioli’s website
Our website
www.onmadesoft.com
contains the landing pages introducing Antonio Ferraioli's apps.
Our website does not track information at all—no cookies, no analytics,
        no personal or non-personal information are collected there.
The website is hosted by a
Service Partner
named
Heroku
(see the
Service Partners
section for details about
Heroku
).
Antonio Ferraioli's apps – Scala40, Ramino, Machiavelli, Pinnacola
(and all future card games developed by Antonio Ferraioli)
Upon activation of the apps, as a technical requirement to run the
        service, the following Non-personal Information will be collected:
model and version of the device used
iOS version
app version
language used
date and time of activation
This information is collected using the
Firebase
Service Provider
        (see the
Service Partners
section for details about
Firebase
).
When playing the app web services (hosted on onmadesoft.com), the
        following are collected:
your Apple Game Center Player ID and alias (nickname)
your iOS Vendor ID (an Apple identifier used to allow us to uniquely
                identify your device when used with our apps)
the type of played game (score or single)
the mode of played game (online or offline)
the start/end date and time of the game
the Apple Game Center Player IDs of players involved in an online game
the played game results (won/lost/exited)
the points collected or lost at the end of the game (those are
                collected to update the game leaderboards)
when playing an online game, the full game model and the points earned
                or lost at the end of the game (which are collected to update the game
                leaderboards)
when showing your Geo Leaderboards (only if you agreed in sharing your current location) we collect your latitude and longitude, this information will never shared and it is only used to build the Geo Leaderboards database
This information is collected in our database (none allows us to know
        your identity or your geographical location), and is stored on a secured
Game
            Database
. Upon request, we can provide an export (and even remove)
        your information from this
Game Database
(just write to
privacy@onmadesoft.com)
When using the free version of the apps, advertisements will be shown to
        you. Advertisements are displayed using the AdMob Mediation Services
        provided by Google.
(See the
Service Partner
section for more details about Google
        AdMob.) Your Personal Information aren't shared with Google (or other
        Mediated Ad providers), but we just ask them to provide ads without
        passing additional information.
By contacting us directly from the app
or by using the Feedback/Contact Us feature from the Help menu
or by sending a crash report after an app crash occurs
you will send us an email, which contains your email address, any
        personal information you will directly add to the email (i.e. your name
        and family name), and a few attachments:
a file containing your app settings
a file containing the model of the latest played game
a file containing the model of the current game in progress
a file containing a screenshot of the current game in progress
a file containing any completed game that has not yet been published
                on the leaderboards
From this email attachment we will be able to know your Apple Game Center
        Player ID and your Apple Game Center Alias (included in the setting
        attachment). With this information, we will be able to export and even
        delete your information from the
Game Database.
All emails and attachments are stored on our office (secured) computer
        and kept just for two months, after which they are deleted. On some cases,
        if your support request requires longer processing times, We will have to
        keep you emails and attachments for longer. You can always ask us to
        delete all your emails and to provide a copy of all emails you sent, and
        we’ll delete or provide a copy if we still have one.
Remember
!
By asking to delete your information
            from the Game Database, you will no longer be able to see you
            leaderboards and play online games.
In case you purchased the apps, or digital goods, or services directly
        from the apps, you will use the Apple App Store payment system, and all
        your personal data, credit cards and transaction information will be known
        by Apple only. Our server and Game Database neither receive nor track any
        information about your purchases, transactions, credit cards or any other
        payment system provided by the Apple App Store. (See the
Service
            Partners
section for details about Apple.)

Heroku
uses a logging system that keeps track of URL requests
        received from web browsers and apps. Those logs are just kept for a few
        minutes and do not contain personal information.
The following is an example of a log row collected by
Heroku
2018-08-15T16:15:52.254724+00:00 heroku[router]: at=info method=GET
            path="/" host=www.onmadesoft.com
            request_id=dc175598-b089-44b5-9cdc-1d737dc69a2c fwd="81.53.214.222”
            dyno=web.2 connect=1ms service=8ms status=200 bytes=4690 protocol=http
In this case, a web browser requested to see the URL of the home page of
www.onmadesoft.com
. As you can see,
        the only non-personal information is the IP address of the URL requester (in
        this example, the fwd field containing the 81.53.214.222 IP address)
