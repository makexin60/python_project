This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected by V Shred, V Shred Subsidiaries, V Shred Brands, Sculptnation, V Shred Threads, and any affiliated or subsidiary companies (“V Shred,” “we” or “us”), offline or online, including, but not limited to, through all of our websites or apps that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, “the Services”).For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services, whether you are a customer, website visitor, job applicant, representative of a company with whom we do business, or another individual whose information we have collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal information we collect, how we use and process personal information, the legal basis for processing, and to whom we disclose personal information. We also tell you how you can reach us to update your contact information, remove your name from our mailing lists, or get answers to questions you may have about our privacy practices. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By continuing to interact with our Services or providing personal information to us after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Policy, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
V Shred is located in the United States. Information collected on our website and applications is stored in the United States; therefore, your information may become subject to U.S. law. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of your data overseas and across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. The laws governing data in your home country may differ from those in the countries to which data is transferred.
1. UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, in which case we will update the “Policy last updated on” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (such as by emailing you at the last email address you provided us, by posting notice of such changes on the Services, or by other means consistent with applicable law) and will take additional steps as required by applicable law. If you do not agree to any updates to this Privacy Policy, please do not continue using or accessing the Services.
2. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When we use the terms “personal information” or “personal data” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of being associated, directly or indirectly, with an individual. It does not include information that has been modified in a substantial way so that it no longer can reasonably identify or be linked to an individual, which we may use for any purpose. To the extent we possess or process any deidentified information, we will maintain and use such information in deidentified/anonymized form and not attempt to re-identify the information, except solely for the purpose of determining whether our deidentification/anonymization process satisfies legal requirements.
When you use the Services, we collect the following categories of personal information from the following sources:
Information You Provide
When Using the Services.
We collect certain personal information directly from you, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, site password, demographic information, user set objective of your workout(s), user set macro nutrition goals, user inputted weight, user inputted height, user submitted activity level, birthday, purchase history, profile photos, completion status of workout(s), health information or financial information when you visit the Services, create an account with us, or register a product or purchase with the Services. Some of our Services also offer you the option to interact with, capture, or save information through the Services. This may include the upload of photos or personal information in a freely distributed form.
Precise Geolocation Information.
We may offer products and services that require us to collect your precise geolocation. In such instances, you may be asked to allow V Shred to collect your precise geolocation, with your knowledge and consent, to provide you with that product or service. If you choose not to provide us with your precise geolocation information, these products and services will not function properly, and we will not be able to provide them to you.
We may also use this precise geolocation information for analytics purposes and will share your precise geolocation information with certain third parties, including, but not limited to, dealers and parties who provide targeted advertising and analytics services.

We may offer online or offline newsletters and other communications or reoccurring emails, about our products, services and promotions.

Information we request includes contact information (such as your e-mail address), photos, health status, weight loss, demographic information, videos, and diet/workout plans. Participation in social media, surveys, solicitations, or contests is completely voluntary. Therefore, you have a choice as to whether to disclose any information. We, our business partners, or the authorized dealer in your area, will use the information provided to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor or improve the use of one or more websites or advertising, and to provide aggregated information for marketing analyses. By submitting information to us via contests, social media, or directly, you grant V Shred an unlimited non-exclusive license to utilize your photo and success story in a variety of marketing mechanisms without attribution or royalty. We may utilize said data, except for your name and contact information, to create new intellectual property and or programs without attribution or royalty. You recognize that social media supported fitness is a key and fundamental part of our program, to which you consent.  We hope that you and your peers get healthy together.
That being said, upon request we will remove any identifiable information, photos, or plans from any digital distribution mechanism within 30 days.  We will agree to stop utilizing said identifiable information from any print or semi-permanent publications on any future publications or prints that require a revision.

Information We Collect Using Cookies and Other Technologies
We collect certain information by automated means when you visit our Services, such as how many users visited our websites and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Services to our visitors. We collect this information through various means such as “cookies” and “web beacons.”
Cookies.
Like many companies, we use “cookies” on some of our Services. Cookies are pieces of code placed on your devices when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify features of the Services in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular website.
Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all the features and functionality of the Services.
Web Beacons.
As described in our separate Cookie Policy, certain pages on our website contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears; the URL of the page on which the beacon appears; the time the page containing the beacon was viewed; the type of browser used to view the page; and the information in cookies set by the third party.
IP Addresses.
An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our website and/or app, we view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We then use this information to determine the general physical location of the device and understand the general locations of our website visitors. We also use this information to enhance our website and/or app.
[Our website recognizes the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, which enables you to opt-out of certain uses or disclosures of your information. If you notify us of your preference through GPC, we will honor your request only for the browser or device that sends the GPC signal. [When you log into your account, the opt-out will extent to your account as well. If you do not have an account or are not logged into your account, your request to opt out through the GPC will not apply to any account information.] To learn more about “do not track” signals, you can visit

Any information we obtain from you in connection with any mobile service, including SMS services, may include your name, address, mobile phone number, your mobile service provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your messages. In addition to any fee we may charge, your mobile service provider's standard messaging rates apply to our confirmation and all subsequent SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. You may opt out or change your information for mobile services via email to Privacy@vshred.com or by sending "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. However, such opting out will not apply to any communications from our other website offerings you have registered for or from the Network sites to whom we may have already provided your information. You must opt out directly with each respective affiliate and follow their individual opt out policy.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We may collect personal information about you from outside sources, including information that we collect directly from third parties and information from third parties that you choose to share with us. For example, we may collect analytics data from providers such as Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel and other tracking cookies,  information we receive from career websites which we use to process your application for employment, information we receive from consumer marketing databases or other data enrichment companies, and information we receive when you choose to link any social media platforms to your account.

To protect the security of your user name and password, we recommend that you use a complex password that is different from passwords you use for other activities, keep all your passwords in a safe place, and do not share your passwords with others.

GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

CA Attorney General

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter

As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at

.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
