International transfers of data
In some cases the personal data we collect from you might be processed outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), such as the United States, the Philippines and the countries in which Laundryheap operates (which are set out on www.laundryheap.com). These countries may not have the same protections for your personal data as the EEA has. However, we are obliged to ensure that the personal data that is processed by us and our suppliers outside of the EEA is protected in the same ways as it would be if it was processed within the EEA. There are therefore certain safeguards in place when your data is processed outside of the EEA.
We ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
your personal data is transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
we use the EU approved Standard Contractual Clauses; and
where your personal data is transferred to third party providers based in the US, data may be transferred to them if they have self-certified under the Privacy Shield framework in relation to the type of data being transferred, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EU and the US.
Please contact us using the contact details above if you want further information on the countries to which personal data may be transferred and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
