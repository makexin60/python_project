Privacy notices
Updated: 23 January 2023
The BBC is a public service. Everything we do has to benefit you, our audience.
We can give you more of what you love when we understand you better. To do that, we ask you to sign in to some of our products and services. We also use your data to benefit you in two ways:
1. A more personal BBC for you
It helps us make the BBC more personal for you. It means we can:
Recommend things we think you’ll like
Show you content that’s relevant to where you live
Make sure you can use things that are appropriate for your age.
2. A better BBC for everyone
As a public service, we need to make something for everyone. As more of our content gets consumed online, it helps to understand who's consuming it so that we can:
Check we really are making something for everyone.
Learn more about what you love so that we can make better stuff in the future.
That's why we ask you to sign in and provide a bit of information.
But throughout all of this, we're committed to make sure your personal, private data stays safe and secure.
What our privacy promise says
Our privacy promise covers how we treat your data and put you in control of what happens to it. It’s based around three main areas…
Transparency
We will always explain clearly what data we’re collecting about you and why. We will only collect data we need to:
give you a better experience
improve our services
fulfil our responsibilities as a public service.
You can
find out more about your information and privacy here
.
Choice
It’s up to you how you use our services. And you can manage or delete your BBC account at any time.
There’s more info on managing your account here
.
Because we’re a public service, we will help you make informed decisions about your data, so everyone can get the best out of digital technologies and the BBC. You can
find out what we're doing with your data here
.
Trust
Your trust is very important to us. So we’re committed to keeping your data safe and secure.
We promise to never sell your personal details to anyone and to only use your data commercially if you're using a commercial BBC service.
You can
find out more about cookies here

Version 3.3
1. What's in this policy?
This policy is for when you're in the UK (
view policy for when you're outside the UK
). It tells you:
what information we might collect about you
how we might use that information
when we might use your details to contact you
what information of yours we might share with others
your choices about the personal information you give us
BACK TO TOP
2. What does this policy cover?
This policy covers
the services
that are offered by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
And sometimes it covers services offered by parts of our organisation that operate as separate companies. Such as:
BBC World Service
,
BBC Studios
,
BBC Studioworks
, BBC Global News, BBC Media Applications Technology, BBC World Service Trading and TV Licensing and BBC charities.
But only when those services link to this policy or tell you it applies.
It’s up to you to decide how much detail you want to know. We have just-in-time explanations that appear when we ask you to input your personal information. As well as what’s in this Policy, a service might have a short privacy notice. In that privacy notice you can find key information on what we do with your personal information when you use that service.
And if you’re after more detail have a look at these topics.
What's not covered in this policy?
Our services sometimes link to services run by other companies' services, like opening a track from BBC Sounds on another music service such as Spotify. Those companies have their own privacy and cookies policies, so remember that the information you give them will follow their rules and not ours.
Sometimes you can access our services from other places, like a BBC Radio 1 YouTube page or the BBC iPlayer app on your connected TV. Make sure to check their privacy policy so you know how they will use your information.
BACK TO TOP
3. How do you protect my personal information?
We're strongly committed to keeping you and your family's information safe. And to do this we design our services with your safety in mind. We also have dedicated teams to look after your information security and privacy.
At the same time, no service can be completely secure - if you have any concerns that your
BBC account
or personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please
get in touch
straight away.
Where we store your information
Some companies that provide services to us run their services from outside the UK and the European Economic Area. We only let that happen if we are satisfied with their levels of security. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be being transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the UK and the EEA.
BACK TO TOP
4. What types of personal information does the BBC collect about me?
We'll give you details about why we need your personal information and how we'll use it before you begin, unless it's obvious.
a. Information that you give us
We might ask for your name and contact details, your date of birth or financial details, depending on what you're doing. If you apply to take part in a programme on politics, for example, we might ask you about your political opinions. Information you give us might include information in a
creation
you share with us, such as people's names that appear in the creation.
When you
register for a BBC account
, or update your details or settings we ask for some personal information, like your email address and age.
b. Device information
Devices are lots of things like:
your computer
your mobile
your TV
your tablet
your voice-enabled device
We automatically collect some technical information from these devices and web browsers
even when you're not signed into to a
BBC account
. This might include:
IP (internet protocol) address
device ID
app ID
vendor ID
advertising ID
c. Location Information
We collect information about your location when you use our products and services. This helps us to determine whether you’re somewhere where are services are available, helps us to ensure we are fulfilling our Charter obligations and to offer additional features whilst using our products and services, such as a weather forecast for your location.
Your location can be determined at a town or city level by:
GPS
IP address
Information about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access point information
What type of location data (for example Country, Region, City or Town) is collected depends on the product or service your using, the device you're using (for example Apple or Android) and your devices settings (whether permissions are enabled or disabled). You can change your permissions on or off any time in your device’s settings. You can read more about
how our apps capture your data on our explainers
.
d. Information on your activities outside the BBC when you talk about us
Like if you've mentioned us in a Twitter post, we'll collect your Twitter handle.
e. Information on how you use our services
Like
the articles you read and the programmes you watch
.
BACK TO TOP
5. How long will the BBC keep my personal information?
When you give us any personal information
we'll let you know how long we'll hold it for
. And always stick to these principles:
we only hold your information for as long as we do the activities we told you about or have a
valid reason
to keep it
we think about what type of information it is, the amount collected, how sensitive it might be and any legal requirements
we design
our services
so that we don't hold your information any longer than we have to
we may close your BBC account if you haven't used it in the last year. We'll send you an email to tell you that we plan to do this before we delete anything, so please check to see if we've sent you any emails about this
BACK TO TOP
6. How can the BBC use my personal information?
We have to have a valid reason to use your personal information. It's called the "lawful basis for processing". Sometimes we might ask your permission to do things, like
when you subscribe to an email
. Other times, when you'd reasonably expect us to use your personal information, we don't ask your permission, but only when:
the law says it's fine to use it, and
it fits with the
rights you have
We use your information for these types of things:
a. to deliver our services and to provide you with information about them
b. to deal with your requests, complaints and enquiries
c. to check if you're using BBC iPlayer and to keep the licensing database accurate and up to date
d. to personalise services and give you things more tailored to your tastes
Your BBC account lets you personalise your BBC online experience. To do that, “Allow Personalisation” is set to on when you create an account. If you’re under 13 and create an account your personalisation is set to off. Information about
how you use our online services
is then connected with other
information you give us
to personalise your experience.
If you don’t want us to do this, you can always
turn personalisation off
in your account settings. If you’re under 13 you don’t need to do anything.
e. to show you relevant advertising on another company's site
Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?
f. to help us understand what kind of services you might use
And sometimes how you might share things with other people
g. to recommend things we think might interest you
What does recommended for you mean?
h. to show you advertising when you access a BBC service from outside the UK
Some of this advertising might be
tailored to you
.
i. to research and innovate
You're not a guinea-pig here, but
knowing how you use our services
could lead to the next big technology breakthrough.
j. to contact you about various things
When will the BBC use my information to contact me?
BACK TO TOP
7. When will the BBC use my information to contact me?
We might use your information to contact you about different things, like:
to update you on any changes to the BBC’s policies, practices and
Terms of Use
to check with you about any service or activity you’ve signed up for. For example, we might tell you if your
BBC account hasn't been used in a long time
. Or it might be about
creating a child account
to contact you about a
creation
you sent us, like things you’ve sent in to School Report news day
to answer you when you’ve contacted us, or to respond to a comment or complaint
to invite you to take part in surveys about BBC services, which are always voluntary
for
marketing purposes
to send you notifications on your device depending on
your settings
We’ll only contact you when we need to or when you’ve given us permission.
We’ll never contact you to ask for your
BBC account password
.
BACK TO TOP
8. Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?
We'll only send you
marketing emails
or contact you about BBC programmes, services and your views on issues about the BBC if you've agreed to this.
Keep in mind, even if you unsubscribe,
we may still contact you.
Will my personal information be used when the BBC advertises with other companies?
If you have a
BBC account
we might use information that we hold about you to show you relevant and
targeted advertising
for BBC services through other companies’ sites, like Facebook, Google, Snapchat or Twitter for example. This could be showing you a
BBC sponsored message
where we know you have a BBC account and have used BBC services.
Where we do this, we will share your data in a hashed format with these providers so that, where you have an account on the same platform, you will see adverts from the BBC. In these scenarios, we are joint controllers with these companies because we jointly determine the purposes and means of processing your personal data.
We also assess certain characteristics of our audience members in order to find others who are similar to them to provide advertising to those individuals.
If you don’t want to see our targeted advertising, you can set ad preferences in your social media companies’ settings. Also, you can visit your BBC account and
turn this off
.
BACK TO TOP
9. When does the BBC share my personal information with others?
We'll never sell your personal information. We do share it with others in these ways:
a. When you make something public
Like
post a comment
which the public can see.
b. When we use other companies to power our services
In order for us to give you quality experiences and to understand how you're using our services we often use other companies to process
your personal information
on our behalf. For example, sending you emails about things we think might interest you, to ask you what you think about our services, or to analyse data on how people use our digital services so we can improve them.
We make sure that your personal information is looked after as if we were handling it directly. We carefully select these companies, only share with them what they need to do the work and we make sure they
keep your information secure
.
c. When we share personal information with companies in the BBC family
What does this policy cover?
d. When you use another company's service that connects to us, like voice-enabled devices and connected TV
You can access our services through a voice-enabled device, like Amazon Alexa, or a connected TV. You’ll need to sign in to your BBC account to use
BBC services
on your connected TV. When you do this we’ll share an identifier for your
BBC account
with the company who runs the service you are using. Make sure to check that company’s privacy policy so you know how it will use your information. The BBC isn’t responsible when you access a BBC service through another company’s services. It’s up to you if you want to access the BBC in this way.
e. When we do collaborative research
We do research activities and sometimes collaborate with research partners. Every now and then we share our
content
and data with them. This might include information we’ve collected about you. But we’re careful about what we share and what our research partners can do with it.
f. TV Licensing
We share some personal information with
TV Licensing
, to check if you’re using BBC iPlayer and to keep the licensing database accurate and up to date.
g. Sometimes by law we have to pass on your information to other organisations
We might also share your information if we have to by law, or when we need to protect you or other people from harm.
BACK TO TOP
10. What's different for kids and teens?
The BBC has services that are kid-friendly and for teens.
Here's what happens when you use them.
a. Why do we collect information about you in the first place?
We keep information about you so that we can
get the right services for you
plan and improve our services
keep in touch with you
b. We'll always tell you why we're collecting your personal information
We’ll explain why and how we use it and for how long. It’s called a “privacy notice”. And if we need your parent or guardian's permission we'll give you clear details about what's needed at the time.
c. We can only use your personal information if we have a valid reason
How can the BBC use my personal information?
d. We share personal information about you to others but we follow some rules
The main rule is we will never sell your personal information to anyone.
When does the BBC share my personal information with others?
e. We might ask you to tell us your age
To make sure you use the parts of the BBC that are suitable for you. For example:
so that adults don't
post comments
on kid's message boards
when you want to
get a BBC account
When you're watching a programme, like on BBC iPlayer, and it's a bit edgy
f. Sometimes we'll ask to get your parent or guardian's consent
You'll see a notification. We might also ask for some details from them, so that we can contact them. Other times we may contact your parent or guardian:
so you can
get notifications
from us
so we can s
how you more things we think you'll like
, based on what you do
so you can post comments
so you can upload your contribution to us
g. Sometimes we'll tell your parents about your activities
For example, if you enter one of our competitions, we might contact your parent.
h. When we can contact you
Sometimes we need to get in touch with you but we'll always follow
these rules
.
i. It's safe to use us
It's our job to
keep your personal information safe and secure
. That's why we design our services with your safety in mind. And we're always looking for the best ways to improve this.
There are also
things that you can do to keep safe
, like
thinking about what information you share
and how to keep your devices secure.
j. Human beings and not robots will make the big decisions that affect you
How is my information being used to make decisions?
k. You might not be able to use our services if you're outside the UK
If you're outside the UK you might not be able to access some services. Like CBBC and CBeebies.
And you may not be able to get a BBC account. Sorry about that.
l. You're in control of how we use cookies and tracking
Cookies are small text files that transfer onto your device when you use a service.
We use cookies and tracking to get information about what type of device you’re using to access our services and we record things like what sites you visit, your IP address (a unique number your device creates every time you connect to the internet) and
to make things easier for you
, like remembering where you got to in a game or what emoji you selected.
You
can switch off some cookies
and similar tracking technologies. Or your parent or guardian can do this if you’re under 13.
But other cookies can’t be turned off
.
m. What we do when you post, upload or share a creation
When you share your
creation
with us we'll
try to tell you exactly what we're going to do with it
.
n. You've got privacy rights, the same as adults, so get to know what they are
You can:
ask us
what personal information we hold
about you
ask us
to correct
or
delete your personal information
tell us
to stop using your personal information
If you're 13 or older, you can do this yourself, but not always. Sometimes we'll be asking for your parent or guardian to do that.
If you're under 13 your parent or guardian probably has to do it for you.
What are my rights?
BACK TO TOP
11. Can I delete my information?
This depends on what information you're talking about.
a. If you're talking about BBC account
You can
delete your account
. Your account information is immediately deleted. Keep in mind:
we keep a record of how you've used our services, but this information can't be linked back to you
we also keep anything you've uploaded or commented on
b. What about other information I've shared with you?
We might have collected other personal information that you might
ask to be deleted
that has nothing to do with BBC account.
BACK TO TOP
12. What are my rights?
Remember, you're in control of your personal information.
You have the right to
:
request a copy of your information
not let robots make big decisions about you
to ask us to correct information that's wrong, to delete it or to request that we only use it for certain purposes
to change your mind, and ask us to stop using your information. For example,
unsubscribing from any marketing emails
or
turning off personalisation
Bear in mind, sometimes we might not be able to help. Like if the law tells us we can't or it forms part of our journalistic output.
BACK TO TOP
13. How does the BBC use cookies and similar tracking?
a. What are cookies and tracking technologies?
Cookies
are small text files which are transferred to your computer or mobile when you visit a website or app.
There are also similar
pieces of tracking information we collect
.
b. Why do we use cookies and other tracking?
To do a few different things:
to remember information about you, so you don't have to give it to us again. And again. And again
to keep you signed in, even on different devices
to help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better
to deliver advertising to websites outside of the UK
to help us personalise the BBC to you by remembering your preferences and settings. And your progress, so you can pause and pick up where you left off watching a programme even on a different device
to find out if our emails have been read and if you find them useful
c. What are the types of cookies?
Some cookies are always on when you visit us, and you can’t turn them off unless you change your browser settings. We call these
“strictly necessary cookies”
. We use them to make sure our digital services work correctly and are meeting audience needs and interests.
We also use
functional, performance and advertising cookies
to make your experience more enjoyable. You can switch these on or off at any time and you can always change your mind. We’ll only use them if you’ve agreed.
Bear in mind there are some other cookies out there from other companies. These
"third-party cookies"
might track how you use different websites, including ours. For example, you might get a social media company’s cookie when you see the option to share something.
You can turn them off
, but not through us.
d. How do cookies last?
Some are erased when you close the browser on your website or app.
Others stay longer
, sometimes forever, and are saved onto your device so that they’re there when you come back.
e. How do I control my cookies and tracking?
Strictly necessary cookies are always on when you visit us. On your first visit to us, we’ll tell you about our other types of cookies and ask you to choose which cookies we can use. You can always change your mind
by going to your settings
.
Stopping all cookies might mean you can’t access some BBC services, or that some of them might not work properly for you.
Another way to control some tracking is in the settings on your device.
BACK TO TOP
14. How will I find out about changes to this policy?
We update this policy sometimes. If we make important changes, like how we use your personal information, we'll let you know. It might be a notice, an email or a message in your app.
If you don't agree to the changes, then you can always stop using our services,
delete your account
and stop giving us any more personal information. We'd be sorry to see you go.
