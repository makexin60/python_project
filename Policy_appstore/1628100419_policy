Guavapay encompasses a range of companies who provide payments solutions and related services to individuals and legal entities. For the purposes of the applicable data protections laws, Guavapay is the data controller of your personal data unless otherwise specified. The Guavapay entity responsible for your data may depend on your location and the service you use with us.
2. The data we collect about you
We collect information about you in three ways: (i) when you provide it to us directly, (ii) when we gather information while you are using our services, and (iii) when we collect information from other sources. Please note that the personal data we collect, and process depend on the Service you use.
Below is a description of the types of information that we may receive directly from you.

We also need to check that you are eligible for the services you want to use, to assess your identity (“know your customer”) and confirm that you are allowed to use our services legally (“due diligence”), and to protect your data and our services from potentially fraudulent activities which may put you and your money at risk. To do this, we may collect data about you from companies that help us verify your identity, do a credit check, prevent fraud or assess risk, which we refer to as “External Data”.

In certain instances we also obtain information about your customers on your behalf as your service provider when they transact with you or otherwise when you request that we do so. We call this information “Customer Data”. We process Customer Data when they interact with you through your use of the Services, for instance when they make a payment at your establishment, or schedule an appointment, or receive an invoice from you.

We use Customer Data as part of our contractual obligation to provide the Services you request to you.
It is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permission for us to process Customer Data in the manner envisaged in this Policy so that we can provide you with the services requested by you.
3. Lawful basis for processing your personal data
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
where you've agreed to us collecting your personal data, or sensitive personal data, for example when you tick a box to indicate you’re happy for us to use your personal data in a certain way;
for the performance of a contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you;
in some cases, we have a legal responsibility to collect and store your personal data (for example, under anti-money laundering laws and financial reporting obligations we must hold certain information about our customers;
where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. We consider and try to balance the possible potential effects (positive or negative) and your rights before processing your personal data for our legitimate interests; and
where we process your personal data, or your sensitive personal data (sometimes known as special category personal data), to adhere to government regulations or guidance, such as our obligation to prevent fraud or support you if you are or become a vulnerable customer.
You have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
4. Purposes for which we will use your personal data
We have set out below, a description of all the purposes for which we will process your personal data.
If you are a legal entity, to register you as a new customer.

If you are a legal entity, to manage our arrangement with you, including: (a) managing payments, fees and charges; (b) collecting and recovering money owed to us.

We will only process your personal data for the purposes specified above unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason which is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain to you the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Our services are not directed to people under the age of 18 (eighteen), and we request that they do not provide personal data to seek services directly from Guavapay. In certain countries, we may impose higher age limits as required by applicable law.
5. Marketing
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We may use your Identity Data and Technical Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which Services and offers may be relevant for you (“Marketing and Communications Data”).
You would receive marketing communications if you purchased similar goods or services or have been in contact with us about similar goods or services. We would also send you marketing communications when you have given your consent for us to do so.
We also may contact you where we have obtained your details from ‘B2B’ business data and marketing solutions providers.
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages through the MyGuava app.
6. Disclosures of your personal data
We may share the personal information described in section 2 for the purposes set out in section 4 with the following service providers and third parties:
Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.
Credit card networks and payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard.
Professional advisers who legitimately need to have access to the personal data for a business need.
Fraud prevention agencies (see more on that below), regulators and other authorities who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Policy.
Your personal information may be shared with the companies within our group. We share information with them, so they can assist us in providing services to you and to understand more about you.
All Guavapay group companies have a legitimate business interest (i.e., to provide a complementary or related service for your business) in accessing the data and may do so for the purposes and in the way described in this Policy. Guavapay group companies shall be taken to include any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with from time to time, whether located in or outside of the United Kingdom. When we transmit data between our group entities located inside and outside of the EEA, this sharing is governed by our intra-group data sharing and processing agreement which is drafted in compliance with the GDPR and includes the relevant safeguards necessary for transfers outside the EEA.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and, unless otherwise notified to you, only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

7. International transfers
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA or the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA or the UK.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is kept secure, including where relevant, by entering into appropriate contractual terms with the receiving party outside the UK or EEA, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission or issued by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (as applicable) or any other approved mechanisms that may become available to us in the future. We will also carry out a risk assessment of the laws and practices of the destination country to identify any technical and organisational measures that need to be put in place to ensure that your personal information is fully protected when transferred to that country.
8. Data security
Data security is extremely important to us, and we have put in place appropriate security measures (such as encryption, confidentiality obligations of our personnel, log-in records, vulnerability testing etc,) to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
We have put in place procedures and incident management policies to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
9. How long we retain your information
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the relevant laws, amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes.
Even after we stop providing services directly to you, we may continue to retain your personal data to: (1) comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; (2) enable fraud monitoring, detection, and prevention activities; and (3) comply with our tax, accounting and financial reporting obligations.
