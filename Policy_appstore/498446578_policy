Cookies and other technology
We use cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacons and proprietary measurement software) on the Healthengine Network to analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems, improve the quality of our products and services, track users’ movements around the Healthengine Network, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
A cookie is a small text file that the Healthengine Network may place on your device to store information. We may use persistent cookies (which remain on your computer even after you close your browser) to store information that may speed up your use of the Healthengine Network for any of your future visits to the Healthengine Network. We may also use session cookies (which no longer remain after you end your browsing session) to help manage the display and presentation of information on the Healthengine Network. You may refuse to use cookies, web beacons or some of the proprietary measurement software features by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser or the settings section of your mobile or tablet device. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Healthengine Network.
Social network platforms
Healthengine uses social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to communicate with the public about its activities. Healthengine may collect your personal information when you communicate with us by using these social networking services, and the social networking services will also handle your personal information for their own activities. These social networking sites have their own privacy policies.
Data analytics
Healthengine uses both internally built survey software and third party vendors for the collection, aggregation and analysis of some survey data (such as Alchemer). The information you provide is stored in a secure data warehouse in either Australia or the United States and is accessed by Healthengine in accordance with a third party vendor’s privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information being stored offshore, you can decline to provide this information by not responding to these surveys.
Your choices
You do not have to use our services, and you may choose which of our services you wish to use. Some of our services, such as our online directory of health professionals and practices, do not require you to provide us with personal information. However, the majority of our services do, and when you use such services, we require you to provide accurate details and do not permit you to use a pseudonym or remain anonymous. For some services, certain information is designated as mandatory (which is required to use the service) and some is optional (which you may choose not to provide, but your failure to provide that information may limit your use of the service). If you do not provide personal information to Healthengine that is designated as mandatory, we will be unable to provide you with that service.

The protections that apply to such personal information will be described in the individual privacy policies of those health professionals, and not in this Privacy Policy.

Overseas disclosures
Some third party service providers used by Healthengine may store your personal information on servers located overseas, including the US. However, they must also meet our requirements for privacy and data security.
5. Data quality and security
Healthengine takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to-date.
Healthengine takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Healthengine implements security measures including:
physical security such as security procedures for access to our business premises; and
IT security procedures including password protection, network firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring.
We store your personal information on secure servers located in Australia in an encrypted, electronic format.
Before disclosing personal information to an entity or person located overseas, Healthengine takes steps to ensure that the recipients of such information do not breach the APPs in relation to the information, by including relevant contractual provisions.
We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or for legal purposes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
6. Access to, deletion of and correction of your personal information
You have a right to request:
access to your personal information;
that your personal information be deleted or de-identified; or
that we correct inaccuracies relating to your information.
In some circumstances, we may not be able to comply with a request that you make in respect of your personal information. For example, we may be required to retain certain information that you ask us to delete for various reasons, such as where there is a legal requirement to do so. Where these reasons to refuse a request in respect of your personal information exist, we will advise you of those reasons at the time you make your request.
If we do agree to your request for the deletion of your personal information, we will delete your data but will generally assume that you would prefer us to keep a note of your name on a register of individuals who would prefer not to be contacted. That way, we will minimise the chances of you being contacted in the future where your data is collected in unconnected circumstances. If you would prefer us not to do this, you are free to say so.
If you request that your personal information is changed, and if Healthengine does not agree to change your personal information, we will enclose your statement of the requested changes with your personal information.
If you would like to obtain access to, delete or request changes to your personal information you can ask our Privacy Officer (details below).
Healthengine can charge a reasonable fee for the time and cost of collating, preparing, and photocopying material for you if you request access to your personal information.
Where we have obtained your consent to handle your personal information, or consent to send you information, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to, unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued handling of your personal information for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition.
Where Healthengine provides services directly to health professionals, this may involve Healthengine receiving and handling information separately on behalf of the health professional, for the purpose of providing those services. In these circumstances, Healthengine will return, retain or destroy any personal information that we have collected in delivering our services to a health professional in accordance with our end user terms and conditions that we agree with that health professional and/or the Health Professional Agreement.

Cookies and other technology
We use cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacons and proprietary measurement software) on the Healthengine Network to analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems, improve the quality of our products and services, track users’ movements around the Healthengine Network, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
A cookie is a small text file that the Healthengine Network may place on your device to store information. We may use persistent cookies (which remain on your computer even after you close your browser) to store information that may speed up your use of the Healthengine Network for any of your future visits to the Healthengine Network. We may also use session cookies (which no longer remain after you end your browsing session) to help manage the display and presentation of information on the Healthengine Network. You may refuse to use cookies, web beacons or some of the proprietary measurement software features by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser or the settings section of your mobile or tablet device. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Healthengine Network.
Social network platforms
Healthengine uses social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to communicate with the public about its activities. Healthengine may collect your personal information when you communicate with us by using these social networking services, and the social networking services will also handle your personal information for their own activities. These social networking sites have their own privacy policies.
Data analytics
Healthengine uses both internally built survey software and third party vendors for the collection, aggregation and analysis of some survey data (such as Alchemer). The information you provide is stored in a secure data warehouse in either Australia or the United States and is accessed by Healthengine in accordance with a third party vendor’s privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information being stored offshore, you can decline to provide this information by not responding to these surveys.
Your choices
You do not have to use our services, and you may choose which of our services you wish to use. Some of our services, such as our online directory of health professionals and practices, do not require you to provide us with personal information. However, the majority of our services do, and when you use such services, we require you to provide accurate details and do not permit you to use a pseudonym or remain anonymous. For some services, certain information is designated as mandatory (which is required to use the service) and some is optional (which you may choose not to provide, but your failure to provide that information may limit your use of the service). If you do not provide personal information to Healthengine that is designated as mandatory, we will be unable to provide you with that service.

seek assurances from health professionals that use our services that they will handle information in accordance with applicable laws, but we have no control over and are not responsible for any health professional’s use of information (including information used by their affiliates and service providers) for which it has effective control.
The protections that apply to such personal information will be described in the individual privacy policies of those health professionals, and not in this Privacy Policy.

Overseas disclosures
Some third party service providers used by Healthengine may store your personal information on servers located overseas, including the US. However, they must also meet our requirements for privacy and data security.
5. Data quality and security
Healthengine takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to-date.
Healthengine takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Healthengine implements security measures including:
physical security such as security procedures for access to our business premises; and
IT security procedures including password protection, network firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring.
We store your personal information on secure servers located in Australia in an encrypted, electronic format.
Before disclosing personal information to an entity or person located overseas, Healthengine takes steps to ensure that the recipients of such information do not breach the APPs in relation to the information, by including relevant contractual provisions.
We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or for legal purposes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
6. Access to, deletion of and correction of your personal information
You have a right to request:
access to your personal information;
that your personal information be deleted or de-identified; or
that we correct inaccuracies relating to your information.
In some circumstances, we may not be able to comply with a request that you make in respect of your personal information. For example, we may be required to retain certain information that you ask us to delete for various reasons, such as where there is a legal requirement to do so. Where these reasons to refuse a request in respect of your personal information exist, we will advise you of those reasons at the time you make your request.
If we do agree to your request for the deletion of your personal information, we will delete your data but will generally assume that you would prefer us to keep a note of your name on a register of individuals who would prefer not to be contacted. That way, we will minimise the chances of you being contacted in the future where your data is collected in unconnected circumstances. If you would prefer us not to do this, you are free to say so.
If you request that your personal information is changed, and if Healthengine does not agree to change your personal information, we will enclose your statement of the requested changes with your personal information.
If you would like to obtain access to, delete or request changes to your personal information you can ask our Privacy Officer (details below).
Healthengine can charge a reasonable fee for the time and cost of collating, preparing, and photocopying material for you if you request access to your personal information.
Where we have obtained your consent to handle your personal information, or consent to send you information, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to, unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued handling of your personal information for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition.
Where Healthengine provides services directly to health professionals, this may involve Healthengine receiving and handling information separately on behalf of the health professional, for the purpose of providing those services. In these circumstances, Healthengine will return, retain or destroy any personal information that we have collected in delivering our services to a health professional in accordance with our end user terms and conditions that we agree with that health professional and/or the Health Professional Agreement.
