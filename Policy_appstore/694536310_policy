Summary
What's a Privacy Policy?
Privacy Policies are legally binding agreements you are
required
to post on your website if you're collecting any sort of personal information from your site's visitors or customers.
A Privacy Policy is an important legal document that lets users understand the various ways a website might be collecting personal information. The purpose of a Privacy Policy is to inform users of your data collection practices in order to protect the customer's privacy.
Your Privacy Policy should disclose how the website/app collects information, how the information is used, whether or not it is shared with third parties and how it is protected and stored.
There are 3 main reasons for having a Privacy Policy: (1) you're required by law, (2) you're required by third party services, (3) you want to be transparent.
A Privacy Policy is Required by Law
You're most likely required by the law to have one posted on your website. The
applicable laws
in your region or the region you're conducting business in may require you to include and abide by certain clauses in your Privacy Policy.
For instance, in the United States, the California Online Privacy Protection Act (
CalOPPA
) requires websites that collect personal information from the residents of the state of California to include a statement in their Privacy Policy that discloses how you handle their information. Since there isn't a way to filter out visitors from California, you're likely required to comply with CalOPPA even if your website is ran from a location nowhere near California.
The EU's
GDPR
also requires a Privacy Policy from most businesses around the world that collect any personal information - including simply an email address - from people located in the EU.
Forever 21's
Privacy Policy agreement has a separate section on
California Residents
that explains the rights of the residents of California in compliance with CalOPPA.
Similarly, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (
PIPEDA
), the Eu's General Data Protection Regulation (
GDPR
), and
Australia's
Privacy Act of 1988 also require you to post a Privacy Policy and include certain clauses in it if you're collecting any personal information from the residents of these regions.
A Privacy Policy is Required by Third Party Services
Most of the third party services you use to improve your website's user experience, monitor analytics or display advertisements require you to post a Privacy Policy on your website.
According to their requirements, you should include clauses that disclose how you use these third party services, APIs, SDKs, plugins, etc.
Some of the most popular third party services that require you to post a Privacy Policy on your website include:
Google Analytics
Google AdSense
Google AdWords
Amazon Affiliates
ClickBank
Twitter Lead Generation
Facebook Apps
Google Play Store
Apple's App Store
Analytics services work by placing cookies on your visitors' devices and then collecting information about them when they visit your website, such as which device(s) they use, browsing activities, etc.
This is why third party services (like Google Analytics) require you to post a Privacy Policy that discloses your usage of their services and cookies.
Google Analytics'
Terms of Service agreement states in its
Privacy
section that you must post a Privacy Policy on your website that discloses your use of cookies and your use of Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data.
Websites and web applications that use analytics services to improve the user experience they deliver must therefore abide by these rules.
If you're a Facebook app developer, you're required by
Facebook
to post a Privacy Policy on your website that's easily accessible and discloses the information you collect and how you will use that information.
Be Transparent in Your Privacy Policy
As more and more people online are becoming aware of privacy laws, having a Privacy Policy displayed on your website that discloses how you gather and handle your visitors' personal information is a great way to build trust and help your website users feel secure.
It's a good practice to follow even if you're not collecting any sort of personal information from your website's visitors. This is because Privacy Policies are increasingly prevalent. If a visitor sees that you don't have one published, she may be led to believe that you do, in fact, collect information from your visitors but aren't disclosing it. It's better to have one posted that states that you do not collect any information from your site's visitors. This is especially true for blogs.
DuckDuckGo
, for example, has a Privacy Policy posted on its website that simply states that it doesn't collect any personal information from visitors.
Recommended Clauses for Your Privacy Policy
The clauses you include in your Privacy Policy depend on a number of factors including the type of business you're running and the applicable law. However, there are some clauses that just about every website that collects personal information from visitors includes in a Privacy Policy.
A Privacy Policy should be organized in a way that helps the reader understand key categories of information. This is best done with well-structured and clearly written clauses, neatly identified with descriptive headlines.
Let's take a look at some examples of clauses that are useful to add in a Privacy Policy agreement:
Type of Information You Collect
Most Privacy Policies start out by disclosing
the type of information the business collects
from its visitors or customers. It lets the end user know which type of personal information they can expect to provide, whether required or optional.
Let's take a look at
MailChimp's
Privacy Policy agreement:
MailChimp has an incredibly detailed
Your Information
section which explains what information it collects from users. It's been divided into several sections -
Information you provide to us, Information we collect automatically, Information we collect from other sources, Information from the use of our mobile apps
.
It identifies the personal information you provide when you sign up with them and/or purchase their services such as name, address, email address, IP address, and credit card information.
Some web applications, like
GitHub
, collect information from their site's visitors in addition to their end users.
Here's a look at how GitHub explains this in its Privacy Policy agreement:
GitHub explains that it collects personally-identifying information from website's visitors and why it's collected. The type of information collected from users who have accounts on GitHub is also disclosed.
How the Collected Information is Processed and Shared
You're required to disclose
how you process and share
the personal information you collect from your site's visitors. It should explain what you do with the information after you've collected it.
For example, in its Privacy Policy,
LogMeIn
explains the different ways it uses the personal information it collects:
LogMeIn also has a section in its Privacy Policy that explains how it shares visitors' personal information with third parties:
Use of Cookies and Tracking
Websites that use cookies or other technologies to obtain personal information from their website's visitors or customers include a cookies clause in their Privacy Policies. Generally, the cookies clause states that
the website uses cookies
,
why
it uses them, and
how users can disable cookies
on their devices.
Canva's
Privacy Policy has a section on
Cookies information
that explains cookies usage.
It says that Canva uses cookies to improve your experience with their website by helping you log in faster and making their on-site navigation better. Cookies are also placed in order to track how you use the website. Canva discloses that its business partners also receive this information. Finally, it's noted that if you disable cookies, some features of Canva might not work properly.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
You will likely have to change the content of your Privacy Policy at some time. For this reason, most Privacy Policies have a clause that states how they will inform users about updates and revisions to the agreement.
Let's take a look at LogMeIn's Privacy Policy again:
This clause states that the Policy may be updated and discloses how notifications of material changes will be given. It also says that if you continue to use the services after the update then you automatically agree to the revised Privacy Policy.
Examples of Websites with Privacy Policies
Regardless of whether you're running a website, web app, mobile app or desktop app, if you're collecting personal information from your end users then you're required to post a Privacy Policy.
Most websites provide a link to their Privacy Policy in their homepage footer, main navigation, or an appropriate sub-menu.
Let's take a look at the Privacy Policy agreements of some popular websites.
Reddit
Reddit
links to its Privacy Policy from the fine print in the footer of the homepage:
The Privacy Policy itself follows the same format and theme as the rest of the website and includes anchor navigation links in the left sidebar.
It includes the following clauses:
What We Collect
How We Use Information About You
How Information About You is Shared
Ads and Analytics Partners
Your Choices
Other Information
Contact Us
Canva
Canva's Privacy Policy uses short summaries to the right of the clauses to help summarize information for readers. This helps make the Policy easier to understand and more user-friendly.
The New York Times
The New York Times
has a link to the Privacy Policy in the website's footer:
The Privacy Policy includes anchor navigation links, a search bar and a button to initiate chat. The benefit in this formatting is that it makes it easy for the site visitor to find information they need to fully understand their privacy rights.
FAQ on Privacy Policies
Yes, a Privacy Policy is required by law in multiple countries such as United States (California), Europe (all member states), Canada, UK, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and many other countries.
Generally, yes. Most third-party services such as Google Analytics or mobile apps App Store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store) will require a Privacy Policy.
Certain clauses or provisions should be present in your Privacy Policy:
The personal information you collect from visitors
How the collected personal information is processed and shared (and with whom)
If you use cookies or any other tracking methods
Summary
If you're collecting any sort of
personal information
from your website's visitors, end users, subscribers, customers, or clients then you're most likely
required by law or by third party services
to post a Privacy Policy on your website.
You need to be aware of:
The privacy laws and Privacy Policy requirements in the
jurisdiction
your business is based in and the jurisdiction(s) where your site visitors live.
The Terms of Service requirements of any
third party services
your website or app uses.
