establish and maintain your user profile on the Service;
enable security features of the Service, such as by sending you security codes via email, and remembering devices from which you have previously logged in;

Whether the retention period is sufficient to fulfill such purposes is the primary criteria for determining the duration of the retention period.

State law privacy rights notice
Scope.
Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to residents of states where they have privacy laws applicable to us that grant their residents the rights described below.
For purposes of this section, “personal information” has the meaning given to “personal data”, “personal information” or similar terms under the applicable privacy laws of the state in which you reside. Please note that not all rights listed below may be afforded to all users and that if you are not a resident of the relevant states, you may not be able to exercise these rights. In addition, we may not be able to process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to confirm your identity or understand and respond to it.
In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of residents of these states, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply with respect to the activities it describes instead of this section.
Your Privacy Rights.
You have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.
Information/know.
You can request whether we have collected your personal information, and in certain cases, information about how we use and share it. For example, if you are a California resident, you can request information for the past 12 months about:
the categories of personal information that we have collected; the categories of sources from which we collected personal information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing and/or selling personal information;
categories of any personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose. and;
the categories of any third parties with whom personal information was sold, shared or disclosed for a business purpose.

Correction
.  You can request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we have collected about you.

Opt-out
.
Opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes.
You can opt-out of certain tracking activities for targeted advertising (also known as interest-based advertising) purposes. The CCPA defines this as “sharing” your personal information with the advertising partners.
Opt-out of profiling and limit the use of your sensitive personal information.
If we process your personal information for profiling purposes as defined by applicable privacy laws, you can opt-out of such processing.
Nondiscrimination.
You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination as prohibited by applicable privacy laws.

https://themighty.com/privacy-request/

Opt-out
Opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes.

Global Privacy Control
website

You may follow a topic by clicking “follow” on the topic page, or we may enroll you into following topics that match your interests or profile data that you have chosen to share, such as your or others’ medical condition. Applicable privacy laws may classify sending such marketing emails based on your interests, profile data and the topics that you follow as “profiling”. You may limit this use of your sensitive personal information and opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email, or by completing the
Personal Data Rights Request Form
. Note, you may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.

We may require a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as by providing your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, the information we request to verify your identity, and confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

Your Privacy Choices
How to Exercise Your Rights.
Opt-out.
Opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes.
While we do not sell personal information for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you. Applicable privacy laws may classify our use of some of these services as “sharing” your personal information with the advertising partners that provide the services, from which you have the right to opt-out. You can submit requests to opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes by using our
cookie preference manager
.  Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request.  You can also broadcast the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt-out for each participating browser system that you use.  Learn more at the
Global Privacy Control website
.
Opt-out of profiling and limit the use of your sensitive personal information.
You may receive marketing-related emails based on the topics that you choose to follow. You may follow a topic by clicking “follow” on the topic page, or we may enroll you into following topics that match your interests or profile data that you have chosen to share, such as your or others’ medical condition. Applicable privacy laws may classify sending such marketing emails based on your interests, profile data and the topics that you follow as “profiling”. You may limit this use of your sensitive personal information and opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email, or by completing the
Personal Data Rights Request form
. Note, you may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.
You may request to exercise other rights offered by The Mighty, such as the right to information/know, access, correction, and deletion, by completing our
Personal Data Rights Request Form
or by mailing us at PO Box 12539, Glendale, CA 91224.

Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Your Inquiry
Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.
A quick summary of how your inquiry will be handled:
As you’re likely aware, the purpose of this form is to help make it easier for you to get in touch with non-EU and/or non-UK organizations that process your personal data. Given that, any data you submit on this form will be transferred to the foreign organization that you identify in the “Name of the organization that your inquiry relates to” field, above, with the aim of helping resolve your concern. Note that you likely won’t hear any response to your inquiry from VeraSafe directly. Unless the foreign organization specifically authorizes us to respond to you directly, the foreign organization will be fully responsible for handling your inquiry on their own, without any involvement from VeraSafe. In our role as a representative working on behalf of foreign organizations, we can facilitate communication between you and the foreign organization but we don’t have any way to resolve your inquiry ourselves. We want to help you, but we have no power to force any foreign organization to respond to your inquiry, even if we (you and us) both think they should.
Since VeraSafe has a legal obligation to relay your inquiry to the foreign organization you identify above, your rights to request that we not use your data for this purpose are quite limited. Likewise, please be aware that we have a legal obligation to document how we handle your inquiries, which may prevent us from erasing your personal data upon your request. If you do not want VeraSafe to process your personal data, you must not submit such personal data to us in any way. You can always direct your concern to the foreign organization directly (instead of VeraSafe), and you have no obligation to send your inquiry to VeraSafe.
Examples of inquiries that are not likely to be accepted using this form:
Customer service issues
Inquiries that don’t provide enough information or context
Complaints that involve any threats, abusive language, or delivering legal notices
Requests for legal advice
Issues un-related to data protection
Inquiries directed to organizations that have not appointed any VeraSafe entity or affiliate as their Data Protection Representative
Examples of inquiries that are likely to be accepted using this form:
Substantive privacy concerns
Inquiries from regulatory agencies
Requests to exercise privacy rights
