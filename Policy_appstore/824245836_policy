Any personal data you upload to publicly visible areas of the Platform (such as review sections), may be collected by third parties, and we have no control over this and are not responsible for how they may use this information. We recommend you are careful about the information you disclose in these areas.
What about third-party links on our Site?
The Platform might include links to third party websites, and often these links are solely there as pointers to information on topics that might be useful to you. Clicking on those links might allow third parties to collect or share data about you.
We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy standards. When you leave the Platform, please remember that this policy no longer applies, and we encourage you to read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
What happens to information you provide via social media?
Parts of the Platform may allow you to submit your own content, such as reviews and photos of your experience. It is important to remember that these submissions can be viewed by the public, and we are not responsible for any actions taken by other individuals if you post personal data on one of our social media platforms. We recommend you are cautious about providing certain information (e.g., card details or your address) and that you refer to the privacy and cookie policies of the social media platforms you use.
What information do you need to know about our key third parties?
Stripe
. We use a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process all payments made by you on our Website & App. Treatwell does not store credit card details and instead relies on Stripe for this. We obtain limited information from Stripe such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date. The processing of such data by Stripe is covered by their privacy policy which may be viewed here:
https://stripe.com/privacy.
Stripe’s services in Europe are provided by a Stripe affiliate, Stripe Payments Europe Limited, an entity located in Ireland.

Do we transfer data outside of the EEA?
The personal data that we hold about you will be held in the UK and the European Economic Area (
EEA
), but it might also be transferred to or stored outside the UK or EEA, including in the US and Israel.
When we transfer your data to third parties outside the EEA, we make sure your data is safe. We do this by putting one of the following safeguards in place:
only transferring it to a country the European Commission has decided has a suitable level of protection, or
by putting in place contracts (known as the Standard Contractual Clauses, and the International Data Transfer Agreement/Addendum) that make sure the third party outside of the EEA promises to protect your personal data. We also make sure any other necessary security measures are put in place.
If you are in the EEA, you can contact us at any time and we will let you know exactly what safeguards we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA. You can also contact us at any time at
support.treatwell.com/hc/en-gb
for a copy of the relevant mechanism.
Your rights
What are your rights and how do you exercise them?
Under the GDPR, you are entitled to the following rights:
Asking us for a copy of your data
: You can ask us for a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Asking us to delete or erase your data
: You can ask us to delete your personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
Sometimes we cannot meet your request because of legal reasons. But don’t worry, we will tell you if this applies when you make your request!
Asking us to correct your data
: You may be able to view or change the data we hold about you by logging in to your online account. If this does not work, you can ask us to correct the data - but we might need to check that the new data you give us is right.
Ask us to send your data to another organisation:
You can ask us to move, copy or transfer your personal data to a different organisation, where it is reasonable and fair.
Ask us how we are using your data:
We will tell you how we collect, use and share your personal data.
Asking us to restrict the processing of your data:
If you have a particular reason (for example the content or how we are using it), you can ask us to limit the ways in which we are using your data.
Objecting to our processing activities:
For certain types of activities, like direct marketing, you can ask us to stop at any time.
You can also object if we are making decisions that are automated or if we are using your data to profile you (this basically means we are using your data to guess what you are interested in or make decisions about you). If there are circumstances when it is really important for us to use your data, we may be unable to stop the processing. But don’t worry, we will let you know if this is the case - and our reasons.
We might ask you to give us information to verify your identity (especially when you ask for financial information). This is to make sure we keep your and our other customers’ personal data safe.
We try to respond to legitimate requests within 1 month of receiving them. Sometimes it might take us longer if your request is complicated or you have more than 1 request. But don’t worry, we will make sure to let you know if we need more time and will keep you updated.
There are some requests that we will not be able to fulfil, and this can be for many reasons, including when there is a risk that another person's personal data will be disclosed, or if we have a legal requirement or a compelling reason to continue processing your personal data which you have asked us to delete.
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please get in touch with us at
support.treatwell.com/hc/en-gb
. If you need more information about your rights, including the circumstances in which they apply to you, please see the ICO’s websites or contact us.
How can you withdraw your consent and opt-out of processing?
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages that you have previously consented to at any time you want. You can do this by following the instructions in our communication, or by using the details set out below:
General.
Following the instructions in the communication or contacting us.

If you withdraw your consent and/or opt-out, we might not be able to provide certain services to you. If this is the case, we will let you know. You can of course give us your consent again if you want to access our services.
Please note that when you have opted out using the above methods, you may still see our non-targeted ads when you are online as we have no control whether these ads are displayed to you.
You have a right to withhold your consent without suffering any adverse effects.

Data Subjects
").
In view of all the above, it is hereby agreed and stipulated as follows.
Appointment of the Data Processor
Treatwell is appointed as a Data Processor pursuant to articles 4, par. 1, no. 8 and 28 GDPR in relation to the provision of the Services under the Agreement.
Subject matter of the DPA
The Agreement and the Premises form an integral and essential part of this DPA and shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
This DPA defines the terms and conditions that Treatwell, in its capacity as data processor and on behalf of the Salon, must comply with when carrying out the personal data processing operations necessary for the provision of the services under the Agreement. This DPA is in fact conditional, in terms of its object and duration, to the Agreement concluded between the Parties. Personal data collected or processed for purposes other than those provided for in the Agreement do not fall within the mandate of the Data Processor.
Processing of personal data assigned to the Data Processor
Treatwell is authorised to process, on behalf of the Data Controller, Data Subjects personal data which are necessary to:

● assisting Data Subjects with complaints and requests for information;
● any other processing of the Data Subjects' personal data necessary for the execution of the Agreement.
In execution of the Agreement, Treatwell only provides the Salon  with the agenda/booking and activity management Software as well as the marketing communication and service evaluation Software. The manner in which both Software are managed and used, including the sending of communications, also for marketing and service evaluation communications, is entirely at the sole discretion of the Salon, with the result that only the Salon can be held liable.

The type of operations carried out on personal data are both automated and non-automated. The Data Processor processes personal data in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.

The Data Processor undertakes to comply with the obligations and instructions given by the Controller. In particular:
●
Compliance with the applicable Data Protection Legislation

The Processor undertakes, when processing personal data, to comply with the principles on the processing of personal data set out in the GDPR (Article 5, GDPR) and, in accordance with the principle of minimisation, to process data only to the extent necessary to provide the activities or applications specified in the Agreement and in this DPA, ensuring that personal data belonging to the Processor itself or to its other clients are processed separately.
●
Respect for purposes
