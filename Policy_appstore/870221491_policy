If you choose to share such data as outlined in the 'Security' section below, we will process it based on the legal ground that the data has been manifestly made public by you.
Automated Processing
Monster may perform automated processing of your personal data to analyse and predict your preferences and interests. In some circumstances, automated processing is necessary for us to provide our services to job seekers and employers. For example, automated processing allows us to match job seekers with employers effectively, to provide job seekers with job alerts and recommended jobs, to send job seeker applications to employers, to display search results, and to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users.
Monster does not make decisions based solely on automated processing
DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We may share your personal data with other organisations in the following circumstances:
If the law or a public authority says we must share the personal data;
If it is needed to provide you with the services or products;
If we need to share personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (this includes providing personal data to others for the purposes of preventing fraud and reducing credit risk);
Any third-party vendors as required in supply of our services or products;
Any Third Parties as Required by Law;
Any third-party Processors for marketing purposes as mentioned “Cookies and Digital Advertising” section.
We will share your data with Sift to perform necessary fraud checks. Sift is a separate data controller and their privacy notice is available here.
RETENTION PERIOD
We will retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with or in connection with you. Usually, Monster will retain your personal data for five (5) years after the last time you interact with our services, at which time it will be automatically deleted from our systems unless we are legally required to keep it longer.
We may retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, investigate security incidents, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our User Agreement, or fulfil your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain anonymised information after your account has been closed.
SECURITY MEASURES
The security of your personal data is important to us. We utilise safeguards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. Monster takes measures to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure. You can find additional information on conducting a safe job search in our
Security Centre
.
Resume Visibility and Security
: Some of our products and services, such as our resume and profile databases, and social media search enable third parties to see your personal data and to contact you.
Information you post in public areas of Monster sites or applications or make visible in the resume and profile database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world
, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal data as defined by your country of residence. While Monster takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorised access or inappropriate use, Monster does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you post.
When you create or post a resume, we store it in our resume and profile databases in the United States. You may control the visibility of your resume on Monster by setting it to a) Visible, b) Confidential, or c) Private. Visible and confidential resumes can be viewed by anyone with access to our resume and profile database. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes that have been viewed or downloaded by others.
You should not post sensitive information about yourself, for example gender, marital status, health data, or any other information you would not want made public, such as your address or phone number, to any Monster site or application or to any public website
. You may adjust your visibility settings at any time by
signing into your Monster account
and selecting visibility settings. Private resumes will not be visible in Monster's resume and profile database. You may still use your private resume to apply online to a job. If you apply with a private resume, it will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of it.
If you apply for a job and provide your contact information to express interest in a job, or if you respond to a communication from an employer, you agree that your information will be shared with the relevant employer and that you will be contacted by that employer for employment- related purposes.
We attempt to limit access to our resume and profile databases to legitimate users. However, once your resume has been disclosed, Monster is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it. Accordingly,
you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public in your resume or profile.
If your resume includes the personal data of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have provided their details and that person has consented for you to do so.

Monster is not intended for, nor do we knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 16.
