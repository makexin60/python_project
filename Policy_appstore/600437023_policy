Applicable legal bases
In accordance with Art. 13 GDPR, we inform you of the legal basis of our data processing. If the legal basis is not mentioned in the privacy policy, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining consent is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 7 GDPR, the legal basis for processing for the fulfilment of our services and the execution of contractual measures as well as for replying to enquiries is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, the legal basis for processing to fulfil our legal obligations is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, and the legal basis for processing to protect our legitimate interests is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f, GDPR. In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR applies as the legal basis.
Security measures
In accordance with Art. 32 of the GDPR, we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing and the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data, as well as the access, input, transmission, security of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that guarantee the exercise of data subject rights, deletion of data and reaction to data risks. Furthermore, we already consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly pre-setting’s (Art. 25 GDPR).
Cooperation with contract processors and third parties
If we disclose data to other persons and companies (contract processors or third parties) within the scope of our processing, transmit the data to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this shall only take place on the basis of legal permission (e.g. if a transmission of the data to third parties, such as payment service providers, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR is required for contract fulfilment), your consent, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.).
If we commission third parties with the processing of data on the basis of a so-called “order processing contract”, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.
Transfers to third countries
If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this occurs in the context of the use of third-party services or disclosure or transfer of data to third parties, this only takes place if it occurs for the fulfilment of our (pre)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, on the basis of a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or leave the data in a third country only in the presence of the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. GDPR. This means, for example, processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a data protection level corresponding to the EU (e.g. for the USA by the “Privacy Shield”) or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations (so-called “standard contractual clauses”).

Cookies and right of objection to direct advertising
Cookies are small files that are stored on the user’s computer. Different data can be stored within the cookies. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after his/her visit to an online offering. Temporary cookies, “session cookies” or “transient cookies”, are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online offer and closes his/her browser. For example, the content of a shopping cart in an online shop or a login Status can be stored in a cookie of this nature. Cookies are referred to as “permanent” or “persistent” if they remain saved even after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved if users visit it after several days have passed. Likewise, the interests of users may be stored in a cookie of this nature and used for range measurements or marketing purposes. Third-party cookies” are cookies that are offered by providers other than the responsible person who operates the online offer (otherwise, if the only cookies are run by the responsible person, they are referred to as “first-party cookies”).
We may use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this within the framework of our data protection declaration.
If users do not want cookies to be stored on their computer, they are asked to deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of their browser. Cookies already saved can be deleted in the system settings of the browser at any time. Deactivating the use of cookies can restrict some of this site’s functionality.
A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be explained for a large number of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the
US site
or the
EU site
. Furthermore, you can deactivate the storage of cookies in the browser settings. Please note that in this case not all functions of this online offer can be used.
Deletion of data
The data processed by us will be deleted or their processing restricted in accordance with Articles 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory storage obligations. If the data is not deleted because it is necessary for other and legally permissible purposes, the processing of the data will be restricted. This means that the data are blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons.
In particular, pursuant to legal requirements in Germany, storage lasts for 10 years pursuant to Section 147 para. 1 AO, 257 para. 1 No. 1 and 4, para. 4 HGB (commercial law) (books, records, management reports, accounting records, trading books, documents relevant for taxation, etc.) and 6 years in accordance with Section 257 Para. 1 No. 2 and 3 para. 4 HGB (commercial letters).
In particular, pursuant to legal requirements in Austria, storage lasts for 7 years in accordance with Section 132 para. 1 BAO (accounting documents, receipts/invoices, accounts, receipts, business papers, statement of income and expenditure, etc.), for 22 years in connection with properties and for 10 years for documents in connection with electronically provided services, telecommunications, radio and television services provided to non-entrepreneurs in EU Member States and for which the Mini-One-Stop-Shop (MOSS) is used..
Administration, financial accounting, office organisation, contact management
We process data within the framework of administrative tasks as well as the organisation of our company, financial accounting and compliance with legal obligations, e.g. archiving. We process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The bases of processing are Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c. GDPR, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR. Customers, prospective customers, business partners and website visitors are affected by the processing. The purpose of and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organisation, archiving of data, namely, tasks which serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the tasks specified in these processing activities.
In this regard, we disclose or transmit data to tax authorities, consultants, such as tax consultants or auditors, as well as other fees offices and payment service providers.
Furthermore, we store information regarding suppliers, event organisers and other business partners on the basis of our business interests, e.g. for the purpose of making contact at a later date. In principle, we store this data, which is mainly company-related, permanently.
Business analyses and market research
In order to operate our business economically, to be able to recognise market tendencies, wishes of the contracting parties and users, we analyse the data available to us to business transactions, contracts, inquiries, etc. We process inventory data, communication data, contract data, payment data, usage data, metadata on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR, whereby the persons concerned include contractual partners, interested parties, customers, visitors and users of our online offer.
The analyses are carried out for the purpose of business evaluations, marketing and market research. We can include the profiles of registered users with information, e.g. on the services they have used. The analyses serve us to increase the user-friendliness, the optimisation of our offer and the economic efficiency. The analyses serve us alone and are not disclosed externally, unless they are anonymous analyses with summarised values.
If these analyses or profiles are personal, they will be deleted or made anonymous upon user termination, otherwise after two years from the conclusion of the contract. For the rest, macroeconomic analyses and general trend determinations are prepared anonymously wherever possible.
Comments and contribution
If users provide comments or other contributions, their IP addresses may be stored for 60 days on the basis of our legitimate interests within the parameters of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR. This takes place for our security, in case comments and contributions contain illegal content (slander, forbidden political propaganda, etc.). In this case, we ourselves could be prosecuted for the comments or contribution and therefore have a legitimate interest in the identity of the author.
Furthermore, we reserve the right, on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR, to process user information for the purpose of spam detection.
On the same legal basis, we reserve the right, in the case of surveys, to store the IP addresses of users for the duration of the survey and to use cookies to avoid multiple votes.
Any information provided in the comments and contributions of the person, any contact and website information as well as the content itself, is permanently stored by us unless the user requests the information to be deleted.

Newsletter – ConvertKit

However, the service does not use the recipient data of our newsletter to approach recipients directly nor do they pass the information on to third parties.
Newsletter – Performance Measurement
The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when opening the newsletter from our server or that of our e-mail delivery service provider. During the download, technical information such as your browser and operating system, as well as your IP address and the time of the download, are collected.
This information is used for technical improvement of the service, as technical data or target group data can be analysed according to their reading behaviour, their download locations (identifiable through IP addresses) or download times. Statistical data collection also includes an analysis of when the newsletters are opened and which links are clicked upon. Although this information technically allows the tracking of individual newsletter recipients, we are not interested in watching the behaviour of individual users. Data analysis is used to recognise patterns in the reading behaviour of users, and to adapt contents accordingly or send different content according to the interests of our users.
A separate revocation of the success measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled.

Marketing & Performance Measurement
Google Tag Manager
Google Tag Manager
is a solution with which we can manage so-called website tags via an interface (and thus integrate Google Analytics and other Google marketing services into our online offer, for example). The Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) does not process any personal user data. With regard to the processing of users’ personal data, reference is made to the following information on the Google services:
Usage Guidelines
.
Google Analytics
This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider of this service is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google Analytics enables the website operator to analyze the behavior patterns of website visitors. To that end, the website operator receives a variety of user data, such as pages accessed, time spent on the page, the utilized operating system and the user’s origin. This data is assigned to the respective end device of the user. An assignment to a user-ID does not take place.
Furthermore, Google Analytics allows us to record your mouse and scroll movements and clicks, among other things. Google Analytics uses various modeling approaches to augment the collected data sets and uses machine learning technologies in data analysis.
Google Analytics uses technologies that make the recognition of the user for the purpose of analyzing the user behavior patterns (e.g., cookies or device fingerprinting). The website use information recorded by Google is, as a rule transferred to a Google server in the United States, where it is stored.
The use of these services occurs on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG. You may revoke your consent at any time.
Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission. Details can be found here:
https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/mccs/
.
Browser plug-in
You can prevent the recording and processing of your data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link:

.
For more information about the handling of user data by Google Analytics, please consult Google’s Data Privacy Declaration at:
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en
.
Google Signals
We use Google Signals. Whenever you visit our website, Google Analytics records, among other things, your location, the progression of your search and YouTube progression as well as demographic data (site visitor data). This data may be used for customized advertising with the assistance of Google Signal. If you have a Google account, your site visitor information will be linked to your Google account by Google Signal and used to send you customized promotional messages. The data is also used to compile anonymized statistics of our users’ online patterns.
Contract data processing
We have executed a contract data processing agreement with Google and are implementing the stringent provisions of the German data protection agencies to the fullest when using Google Analytics.
Google AdSense with personalised ads
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation, and economical operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).
Google is certified under the
Privacy Shield Agreement
and thus offers a guarantee of compliance with European data protection law.
We use the
AdSense
service, which is used to display ads on our website and of which their insertion or other use we receive payment. For these purposes, usage data such as the click on an advertisement and the IP address of the user are processed, whereby the IP address is shortened by the last two digits. Therefore, the processing of the user’s data is pseudonymised.
We use AdSense with personalised ads. Google uses the websites visited by users or the apps used and the user profiles created in this way to draw conclusions about their interests. Advertisers use this information to align their campaigns with these interests, which is beneficial for users and advertisers alike. For Google, ads are personalised when collected or known information determines or affects ad selection. These include past searches, activities, site visits, use of apps, demographic and location information, and more. Specifically, this includes demographic targeting, targeting on interest categories, remarketing, and targeting on customer match lists and target group lists uploaded to DoubleClick Bid Manager or Campaign Manager.
For more information about Google’s use of data, preferences and opt-out options, refer to the
Google privacy policy
and the
Settings for Google’s display of ads
.
Google AdWords and Conversion Measurement
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation, and economical operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).
Google is certified under the
Privacy Shield Agreement
and thus offers a guarantee of compliance with European data protection law.
We use the online marketing process Google “
AdWords
” to place ads on the Google Advertising Network (e.g., in search results, videos, on websites, etc.) to show them to users who have a suspected interest in the ads. This allows us to display ads for and within our online offer more specifically in order to only present ads that potentially correspond to the users interests. For example, if a user sees ads for products he has been interested in on other websites, this is referred to as “re-marketing”. For these purposes, when the user accesses our and other websites on which Google marketing services are active, Google directly executes a Google code and (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as “web beacons”) are integrated into the website. These store a unique cookie or comparable technology on the user’s device. This file keeps a record of which websites the user visited, which contents he is interested in and which offers he has clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and further information about the use of the online offer.
We also receive an individual “conversion cookie”. The information collected with the help of cookies is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us. However, we only see the total number of anonymous users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. We do not obtain any information that can be used to identify users personally.
User data is processed pseudonymously within the Google advertising network. This means that Google does not store and process the names or email addresses of users, for example, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. This means that, from Google’s point of view, the ads are not managed and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie holder, regardless of who this cookie holder is. This does not apply if a user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymisation. The information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the USA.
For more information about Google’s use of data, preferences and opt-out options, refer to the
Google privacy policy
and the
Settings for Google’s display of ads
.
GetSiteControl
We use the service “
GetSiteControl
” operated by GetWebCraft (Klimentos 41-43, Klimentos Tower, Flat/Office 25, 1061, Nicosia, Cyprus) to display targeted messages on our website in the form of popups or a notification bar and to display a “Share Bar” that allows the content of our site to be quickly and easily shared on social networks. You can view
GetWebCraft’s privacy policy here
. The service provider is assigned on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with. Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR and an Order Processing Agreement in accordance with Art. 28 para. 3 p. 1 GDPR.
As always with embedded content from third parties, this requires GetWebCraft to be aware of the IP address of the user, as without the IP address they could not send the content (e.g. the share bar on the left-hand side of the window) to their browser. The IP address is therefore necessary to display this content. We strive to only use content whose respective provider uses the IP address solely for the delivery of content. Third parties such as GetWebCraft may also use so-called “pixel tags” (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. “Pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other information about the use of our online offering. It may also be linked to such information from other sources.
VG Wort / scalable central measuring method
We use the scalable central measuring method („Skalierbare Zentrale Messverfahren“ (SZM)) of INFOnline GmbH (INFOnline GmbH, Brühler Str. 9, D-53119 Bonn, Germany) for the determination of statistical parameters for determining the probability of texts being copied. This includes the collection of anonymous values. The visitor number measurement alternatively uses a session cookie or a signature, which is created from various automatically transmitted information of your browser, to recognise computer systems. IP addresses are only processed in anonymous form. The procedure was developed with data protection in mind. The sole aim of the procedure is to determine the likelihood of individual texts being copied. At no time are Individual users identified. Your identity is always protected. You will not receive any advertising through the system.
Many of our pages contain tracking pixels for site visits via which we report access to the collecting society
Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG Wort)
. We thus make it possible for our authors to participate in the dividends of VG Wort, which insure the legal remuneration for the use of works protected by copyright in accordance with Section 53 of the Copyright Act.
By doing so, user data and metadata of the users are processed, whereby the IP addresses are shortened and the measurement methods are pseudonymous. The shortened IP address is stored for a maximum of 60 days. The usage data in connection with a pseudonymous assignment value (“identifier”) are stored for a maximum of 6 months.
Users may also
opt-out
, if they object to data collection for the aforementioned purposes. Further information can be found in the
privacy policy of IN Online

Facebook pixel, Custom Audiences and Facebook-Conversion
Due to our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer and for these purposes the so-called “Facebook pixel” of the social network
Facebook
, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”), is used within our online offer.
Google is certified under the
Privacy Shield Agreement
and thus offers a guarantee of compliance with European data protection law.
With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine the visitors of our online offer as a target group for the presentation of advertisements (so-called “Facebook ads”). Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel to display our Facebook ads only to Facebook users who have shown an interest in our website or who have certain traits (e.g. interests in certain topics or products that are determined by the websites visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called “custom audiences”). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we want to make sure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and are not annoying. The Facebook pixel also helps us understand the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and marketing research purposes by showing and evaluating whether users are directed to our site after they have clicked a Facebook ad (so-called “conversion”).
Facebook processes the data in accordance with
Facebook’s Data Usage Policy
. Accordingly, general information about the display of Facebook ads is in the Facebook data usage policy. For specific information and details about the Facebook pixel and how it works, see the
Help section of Facebook
.
You can object to the collection and use of your data with Facebook pixels for Facebook ads. To set what types of ads you see within Facebook, you can view the page set up by Facebook and follow the
instructions for the settings of usage-based advertising there
. The settings apply across platforms, i.e. they are applied to all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.
You may also object to the use of cookies for reach measurement and advertising purposes via the
disabling page of the network advertising initiative
and additionally the
US website
or the
European website
.
Data transfer with Zapier
For the automated transfer of required user data between the various marketing tools (e.g. to transfer a newsletter registration via the reader survey to our mailing service provider ConvertKit or the transfer of shop orders to our shipping service provider), we use the software “
Zapier
” from the provider Zapier, Inc. 548 Market St #62411, San Francisco, California 94104, USA. Zapier is used on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR and an Order Processing Agreement is used in accordance with Art. 28 para. 3 p. 1 GDPR. ConvertKit is certified under the
Privacy Shield Agreement
and thus offers a guarantee to comply with the European data protection standards. You can view the
service provider’s privacy policy here
. The transferred user data includes answers from our reader surveys and other forms, names and e-mail addresses as well as purchases made in our online shop.
Google Doubleclick
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation, and economical operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).
Google is certified under the
Privacy Shield Agreement
and thus offers a guarantee of compliance with European data protection law.
We use the online marketing process Google “
DoubleClick
” to place ads in the Google Advertising Network (e.g., in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.). DoubleClick is characterised by displaying ads in real time based on users’ suspected interests. This allows us to display ads for and within our online offer more specifically in order to only present ads that potentially correspond to the users interests. For example, if a user sees ads for products he has been interested in on other websites, this is referred to as “re-marketing”. For these purposes, when the user accesses our and other websites on which Google marketing services are active, Google directly executes a Google code and (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as “web beacons”) are integrated into the website. These store a unique cookie or comparable technology on the user’s device. This file keeps a record of which websites the user visited, which contents he is interested in and which offers he has clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and further information about the use of the online offer.
The IP address of the users is also recorded, whereby the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states of the European Economic Area Agreement and only in exceptional cases completely transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The above information may also be linked by Google to such information from other sources. If users subsequently visit other websites, the ads displayed may be tailored to their interests.
User data is processed pseudonymously within the Google advertising network. This means that Google does not store and process the names or email addresses of users, for example, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. This means that, from Google’s point of view, the ads are not managed and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie holder, regardless of who this cookie holder is. This does not apply if a user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymisation. The information collected by Google marketing services about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the USA.
For more information about Google’s use of data, preferences and opt-out options, refer to the
Google privacy policy
and the
Settings for Google’s display of ads

Surveys – Typeform and Apester

For product-related surveys we use the service “

Access data includes the name of the requested website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, report whether the site was successfully retrieved, browser type and version, the user’s operating system, the referrer URL (the site visited before coming to our site), the user’s IP address, and the requesting internet service provider. The access data is already transferred to Apester when the survey or the page on which it is integrated is called up. Third-party providers may also use so called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as web beacons) for statistical or marketing purposes. “Pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other information about the use of our online offering.

GDPR) we include content or service offerings of third parties so that we can incorporate their content and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”).
This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content can see the IP address of users, since without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to the users’ browsers. The IP address is therefore necessary in order to display this content. We strive only to use content from providers who use the IP address to deliver content, and for nothing else. Third-party providers may also use so called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as web beacons) for statistical or marketing purposes. “Pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other information about the use of our online offering.

Online social media presence
We maintain online presences on social networks and platforms in order to communicate with active customers, interested parties, and users and to inform them about our services.
We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be processed outside the European Union, which can pose risks for users because this might hinder the enforcement of users’ rights, for example. With regard to US providers certified under the Privacy Shield, we would like to point out that they commit themselves to comply with EU data protection standards.
Furthermore, user data are generally processed for market research and advertising purposes. Thus, for example, user profiles can be created from the user behaviour and the associated user interests. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to display advertisements that presumably correspond to the interests of the users both within and outside of the platforms. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user’s computer, in which the user’s usage behaviour and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in user profiles separate from the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in).
The processing of users’ personal data is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests to effectively offer users information and communicate with users. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR. If the users are asked by the respective providers for consent to data processing (i.e. give their consent, e.g. by ticking a box or clicking a button), the legal basis of the processing is § 6(1) (a) and § 7 of the GDPR.
For a detailed description of the respective processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out), we refer to the information provided by the providers linked below.
We would like to point out that requests for information and the assertion of user rights are also directed most effectively to the providers. Only the providers have access to the user data and can directly take appropriate measures as well as provide information. If you still need further assistance, you can contact us.
