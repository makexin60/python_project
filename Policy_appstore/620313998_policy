Websites also offer certain online services in which you will have to previously register in order to get access and use the available services; such as, the Partner Portal and Software Area. In these cases, Salto will process your data to manage your registration to the corresponding website as well as to provide the products and services that are linked to your account, including communicating information in relation to them. Note that given that some of these online services are fee-based services or restricted access services, so not all Website users will be able to get access to such services.
Salto may communicate this data to the Group entities corresponding to the geographical area where you are located with the aforementioned purposes, in order to guarantee the provision of services according to the criteria established by Salto and to ensure certain standards and quality of the contracted services, depending on the place where you reside.

You may obtain a copy of Salto's required measures by contacting Salto at the address listed at the end of this policy.
