Meta View
Children's privacy highlights
As described in the
Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Terms of Service
, children below the age of 13 are not permitted to use Meta View. Therefore, a Meta account for a child between the ages of 10 and 12 (or 10 and 13 if you are in Spain) cannot be used to log in to the Meta View companion app (the "App").
Meta View is a wearable experience that lets you interact with your environment in new and innovative ways. The Meta View companion app (the "App") pairs with AI Glasses made and distributed by Luxottica, including any Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses within the Ray-Ban | Meta collection and the Ray-Ban Stories (collectively, the "AI Glasses"). Meta software powers the features on the AI Glasses. This Supplemental Privacy Policy applies to "Meta View", which means, together, the App, the software on the AI Glasses and their related services and features. Some features and functionality are only available on Ray-Ban | Meta AI Glasses.
I. What information do we collect for Meta View?
In addition to the information described in the Meta Privacy Policy under
What information do we collect?
, and in this Supplemental Privacy Policy under What information do we collect for Meta Accounts?, we collect the following categories of information when you use Meta View:
Photo, video and audio information
: When you use the AI Glasses to take a photo or video, the cameras and microphones on the AI Glasses are activated and the following information is collected:
Photos, videos and audio
. You can use the AI Glasses to take photos and video recordings with audio. This media is stored on your AI Glasses, until it's uploaded to your App. We will access and process your media when you turn on Meta View's cloud processing on your AI Glasses or upload your media to certain services provided by Meta (i.e. Facebook or Instagram). You can change your choices about cloud processing of your media at any time in Settings.
If you choose to live stream on your Ray-Ban | Meta AI Glasses, video and audio content from your live stream will be processed through the Meta Company Product that you live stream from (i.e. Facebook or Instagram). The video and audio content from your live stream will not be stored on your Ray-Ban | Meta AI Glasses after you've finished a live streaming session or in the App. Your use of a Meta Company Product to live stream will be subject to the terms and policies of that Meta Company Product.
If available, you can use the Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses to translate live conversations into a different language. The audio recordings and the transcripts generated when you use the feature are processed on your Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses and in the App. The audio recordings and transcripts are deleted after you've finished using the feature.
Metadata
. We collect metadata, such as the date and time that you created content, whether it's a photo or a video recording, and technical information about your camera or other AI Glasses sensors related to content.
Location-related information

is information needed to ensure that the AI Glasses work as expected, meet user expectations and provide the service outlined in the Terms of Service. For example, we collect information to perform certain actions on the AI Glasses and to see whether the AI Glasses are working correctly, such as if the Bluetooth is functioning. In addition, similar to other devices, if the AI Glasses crash or malfunction, a log is sent to Meta that includes information from the time of the crash event, such as the date and time of the crash and how you were using your AI Glasses immediately before the crash event. These crash logs are only retained and used to diagnose and fix problems with your AI Glasses. Essential Data is automatically shared with Meta.
Additional Data

Additional Data includes information such as analytics about AI Glasses usage to help us develop new features and products to provide a better user experience.

Voice interactions are things that you say when using our voice services, including when voice services are invoked by mistake, as well as any background sound that can be heard once voice services have been enabled. Voice interactions include both things that you say when you use a wake-word (for example, if your AI Glasses are playing music, and you say "Hey Meta, pause the music") and also when you don't use a wake-word for certain interactions (saying "pause music"). The information that we process for our voice services includes audio recordings and transcripts of your voice interactions, as well as data related to your voice interactions, such as the hardware version of your AI Glasses and how long your interaction took.

When voice storage and processing for product improvement is turned on, we use machine learning and trained reviewers to process information about your voice interactions to improve, troubleshoot and train our voice controls and other Meta products. We share that information with third-party vendors and service providers to improve our products. Even with voice recording storage off, you can still use voice controls. You can access and delete stored voice information in your settings.
