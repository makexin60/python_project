We may utilize your personal data to transmit updates (via email, text message, telephone, or post) regarding our services, encompassing exclusive offers, promotions, and new services.
Our legitimate interest underpins the use of your personal data for marketing purposes (as detailed in the ‘Use of Information’ section above). This implies that, in most cases, we do not require your consent to forward marketing information. Nevertheless, should consent be necessary, we will request it explicitly and independently.
You have the prerogative to opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time, and you can do so by reaching out to us at support@weglow.app.
We might seek to verify or amend your marketing preferences if you solicit further services from us in the future, or in response to alterations in laws, regulations, or the configuration of our business.
Rest assured, your personal data will always be handled with the utmost respect, and we will never distribute it to other organizations for marketing objectives.

Other third parties who support the functioning of our business, including marketing agencies, mailing service providers, system providers, accounts payable, website hosts, our financial institutions, and courier services.
Third parties authorized by you, like social media platforms you choose to connect your account with or third-party payment providers.
Credit reference agencies, HM Revenue & Customs, regulators, and other authorities that may act as processors requiring reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
We will only allow our service providers to handle your personal data if we are convinced that they have adopted appropriate measures to safeguard it.
Additionally, we impose contractual obligations on service providers to ensure that they can solely utilize your personal data to furnish services to us and to you. We may also disclose personal information to external auditors.
Should the need arise, we may divulge and exchange information with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to fulfill our legal and regulatory obligations.
Furthermore, we might be required to share certain personal information with other parties, particularly potential buyers of portions or the entirety of our business or in the context of a business reorganization. Typically, the data shared will be anonymized, although this may not always be feasible. The recipient of this information will be bound by strict confidentiality commitments.

To address any inquiries, complaints, or claims made by you or on your behalf.
To demonstrate that we have treated you fairly.
To maintain records required by law.
TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE UK
On occasion, it is essential for us to share your personal data outside the UK to offer services to you. This primarily pertains to individuals located outside the UK. When transferring your personal data to a country or international organization outside the UK, we must adhere to data protection laws. This process is subject to certain conditions, which are delineated below:
ADEQUACY DECISION
We may transfer your personal data to specific countries based on an adequacy decision. These countries include:
All European Union countries, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (collectively known as the ‘EEA’).
Gibraltar.
Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Uruguay.
The list of countries with adequacy decisions may change periodically. We will always endeavor to rely on an adequacy decision when one is applicable.
For other countries we may transfer personal data to, in the absence of an adequacy decision, it does not necessarily indicate inadequate data protection. In such cases, we must explore alternative grounds for the transfer, which include ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place or relying on specific exceptions, as further detailed below.
TRANSFERS WITH APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS
In cases where no adequacy decision is in place, we can transfer your personal data to another country if we are confident that the transfer complies with data protection regulations. To achieve this, we must have appropriate safeguards in position and provide enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects.
Typically, these safeguards entail using legally approved standard data protection contract clauses. If you require a copy of these standard data protection contract clauses or more information regarding relevant safeguards, please don’t hesitate to contact us (refer to ‘How to contact us’ below).
TRANSFERS UNDER AN EXCEPTION
In situations where no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are available, we may transfer personal data to a third country or international organization when an exception is applicable under relevant data protection laws. Such exceptions include:
Your explicit consent to the proposed transfer, following adequate information regarding the potential risks.
Necessity of the transfer for executing a contract between us or initiating pre-contract measures upon your request.
Necessity of the transfer for a contract in your interests, involving us and another party.
Necessity of the transfer to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
Additionally, we may transfer information for the purpose of our compelling legitimate interests, provided such interests are not overridden by your interests, rights, and freedoms. Specific conditions apply to such transfers, and we will supply pertinent information when and if we seek to transfer your personal data on this basis.
EUROPEAN COMMISSION ADEQUACY DECISION
The European Commission has the authority to assess whether a country or international organization affords an adequate level of personal information protection. If such a determination is made, it results in an ‘adequacy decision,’ meaning personal information can flow from the UK to that country without the need for additional safeguards.
Issuing an adequacy decision can take several years, and only a limited number of countries currently benefit from this status.
FURTHER INFORMATION
For additional details regarding data transferred outside the UK, we invite you to reach out to us (please see the ‘How to contact us’ section below).
YOUR RIGHTS
You possess the following rights, which you can exercise without incurring any charges:
Access: The right to obtain a copy of your personal information (the right of access).
Rectification: The right to request corrections to your personal information.
To be forgotten: The right to obtain a copy of your personal information and to request its deletion in certain situations.
Restriction of processing: The right to obtain a copy of your personal information and to request the restriction of its processing in certain circumstances (e.g., if data accuracy is contested).
Data portability: The right to obtain a copy of your personal information and request it in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, or to transmit it to a third party in certain situations.
To object: The right to object to your personal information being processed for direct marketing or other situations, including processing based on our legitimate interests.
Not to be subject to automated individual decision making: The right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing that significantly affect you or have legal effects.

KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE
We have put appropriate security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access, use, or loss of personal information. Access to your personal information is restricted to individuals who genuinely require it for legitimate business purposes. Those processing your information are subject to confidentiality obligations.
