One & Only Collective Inc. Arbitration Agreement
Both you and One & Only Collective Inc. agree that any controversy, claim, action, or dispute in any way related to your use of any One & Only Collective website, any purchase from Selfie Leslie, or any products or services sold or distributed by One & Only Collective (“Dispute”) will be resolved by this Dispute Resolution procedure and Arbitration Agreement (the “Arbitration Agreement”).
Informal Dispute Resolution
Either Party asserting the dispute (“Dispute”) shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other Party (by first-class or registered mail) describing the facts and circumstances, including any and all relevant supporting documentation, of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party thirty (30) days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent to the following addresses:
If to One & Only Collective Inc. at:
LAW OFFICES OF GERARD SOUSSAN
9595 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 406 Beverly Hills, CA 90212 ATTN: Gerard Soussan
Or:
If to you: at your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your online profile.
Both One & Only Collective and you agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.
Scope of Arbitration Agreement
To the extent that you cannot resolve any Dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure described above, a Dispute shall be resolved through binding individual arbitration. Accordingly, you and One & Only Collective Inc. agree to give up the right to go to court to assert or defend rights under this Arbitration Agreement and for any Dispute. You and One & Only Collective Inc. expressly delegate to the arbitrator the authority to determine the arbitrability of any Dispute, including the scope, applicability, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, which shall be governed by, interpreted, construed, and enforced per the Federal Arbitration Act and, where applicable, the laws of the State of California.
Arbitration Procedure
Each party, in consideration of the fact that there shall be an arbitration which is binding and final, agrees to waive any claim for punitive and exemplary damages and seek only compensatory damages in such proceeding. In the event of a dispute, the demanding party shall notify the opposing party in writing of its demand for arbitration. All initial costs of the proposed arbitration shall be advanced and borne by the party demanding arbitration. Once the demand has been made, the demanding party shall select three proposed retired superior court judges and the responding party shall have three (3) business days to either accept one of the three or to propose three additional judges. If the counter proposed judges are not acceptable to the demanding party, also within three (3) business days, the parties agree to submit their dispute to a dispute resolution service such as ADR or ARC. The demanding party shall select the forum, and thereafter the service shall select the judge.
Each party expressly agrees that both jurisdiction and venue shall lie exclusively in Los Angeles County, California, and that all written notices and demands may be served by email or by facsimile followed by U.S. mail with an appropriate declaration of service, and that such methodology shall be deemed compliance with all service of process and notice requirements of California law. Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding, and conclusive and the parties acknowledge and understand that by entering into this arbitration provision they are waiving their constitutional right to a jury trial and their right to appeal. The arbitrator shall have full discretion to make any awards of attorneys’ fees and costs in accordance with the applicable law of the state of California.
Waiver of Right to Bring Class Actions and Representative Claims
All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the Dispute with the same remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other customer. You and One & Only Collective Inc. agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their respective individual capacities and in so doing you and One & Only Collective Inc. hereby waive the right to trial by jury, to assert or participate in a class-action lawsuit or class action arbitration (either as a named-plaintiff or class member), and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.

Privacy Policy
Cookie Policy of Selfie Leslie
This document informs Users about the technologies that help Selfie Leslie to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with Selfie Leslie.
For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.
For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent, depending on the applicable law. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.
Selfie Leslie uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.
The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.
In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.
How Selfie Leslie uses Trackers
