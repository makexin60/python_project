3. Who is my data disclosed to?
We may disclose your Personal Data to other companies within our group for the purposes set out in "What is this data being used for?" above, as well as to law enforcement and regulatory agencies as may be required by law.
If you use certain features in the Services, such as collaboration features, the information contained in the content that you share, which will include any Personal Data contained in such content, will be shared with the individuals that you select or anyone else who they may share with. We will not share your information this way unless you direct us to do so through your use of the Services.
When you create notes or documents when using the Services, these are stored on the Goodnotes application on your device - Goodnotes does not store your notes or documents on its own servers and does not access or collect such data without your permission. However, if you back up your notes or documents by using relevant functionalities that we provide, your data may be shared with third parties as follows:
If you use Goodnotes Cloud to back up the notes or documents that you have uploaded onto the Goodnotes application or other Services (by turning on auto-backup on a compatible device), any Personal Data contained within these notes or documents will be saved on Goodnotes Cloud and therefore shared with the third parties that we use to power the infrastructure for Goodnotes Cloud. These third parties may be located in a country outside the UK and/or EEA – please refer to section 5 (International transfers of Personal Data) below. If you make any changes to any of your notes or documents (including to any Personal Data) that you have backed up on Goodnotes Cloud, we will automatically replace that copy in your cloud storage by sharing your updated notes and documents with the third parties that power the infrastructure for Goodnotes Cloud, so that your notes and documents are always up to date. We will not, however, access or collect data (including any Personal Data) from your notes or documents irrespective of whether they are stored on Goodnotes Cloud.
We provide optional functionalities which allow you to sync your notes and documents on the Goodnotes application to your iCloud account. If you enable iCloud sync on a compatible device, any Personal Data contained within your notes or documents will be shared with iCloud so that any edits that you make to your notes and documents are saved on iCloud in real-time.
We may disclose and transfer your Personal Data to our agents, contractors or vendors ("
Service Providers
"). When we do this, we will ensure that they are under a duty of confidentiality to us and we have imposed contractual obligations to ensure they can only use your Personal Data to provide agreed services to us and to you. Such Service Providers may provide administrative, data processing or other similar services to us to enable us to better provide the Services.
We may provide your Personal Data to actual or proposed assignees or transferees of our rights with respect to you in connection with a merger, sale or transfer (whether of assets or shares), reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of a company within our group, or steps taken in anticipation of such events (e.g., due diligence in a transaction). In such cases, information will be only be shared where necessary.
In particular, certain of the specific third parties that we disclose data to include:
In order to log aggregated statistical, non-Personal Data, we use Google Analytics for Firebase.
We use Mailchimp for sending newsletters and tips and tricks to subscribers that subscribe voluntarily.
To collect feedback and ideas in our idea forum, we use the service provided by UserVoice. In order to submit feedback to the forum, an account with UserVoice will need to be created.
We use Amazon Web Services to power the infrastructure for Goodnotes Cloud.
We use Datadog to collect diagnostic and usage data and monitor the infrastructure for Goodnotes Cloud.
We provide optional functionalities which allow you to sync your files on the Goodnotes application to your iCloud account.
We use Mixpanel and Amplitude to collect information about the usage of our app to maintain and improve the Goodnotes application, our products and services. and features.
We use externally trained models, in particular large language models and embeddings models incorporated into services provided by Amazon Web Services to provide the functionality for Goodnotes AI.
We use a digital rights management solution to monitor the use of certain  digital products released on Goodnotes Marketplace.
We may use Zendesk by Zendesk Inc. or other third party providers to provide you with customer support services (including handling customer support emails, online submission of customer inquiries and Answer Bot functionalities on Goodnotes Help Centre).
We use Paddle to assist us with processing payments data.
We use HubSpot to assist us with processing the data of our Enterprise Users for CRM purposes, including marketing activities.
We may use Braze or other third party providers to notify you of important events about the Services and provide you with an enhanced user experience when using the Services.
We may use Sprig, UserTesting, Google Forms, Lyssna and other third party tools from time to time for user research purposes.
4. Retention Process
How long we will hold your Personal Data for will vary and will be determined by the following criteria:
the purpose for which we are using it – we will need to keep your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for that purpose; and
legal obligations – laws or regulation may set a minimum period that we have to keep your Personal Data.
5. International transfers of Personal Data
We are a global business. Our customers and our operations are spread around the world. As a result, we collect and transfer Personal Data on a global basis. That means that we may transfer your Personal Data to locations outside of your country.
When we transfer your Personal Data to another country outside the UK and/or EEA, we will ensure that it is protected and transferred in a manner consistent with legal requirements. In relation to data being transferred outside the UK and/or EEA, for example, this may be done in one of the following ways:
the country that we send the data to might be approved by relevant data protection authorities as offering an adequate level of protection for Personal Data;
the recipient might have signed up to a contract based on “model contractual clauses” approved by relevant data protection authorities, obliging them to protect your Personal Data;
the recipient may have adhered to binding corporate rules; or
In other circumstances the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your Personal Data outside Europe.
You can obtain more details of the protection given to your Personal Data when it is transferred outside the UK and/or EEA (including a copy of the standard data protection clauses which we have entered into with recipients of your Personal Data) by contacting us as referred to in the “More Questions” section below.
6. Keeping your data secure
We will use technical and organisational measures designed to safeguard your Personal Data, for example:
access to your membership, if you register with us, is controlled by your email and a password that is unique to you;
we encrypt your Personal Data;
any Personal Data that we process or store is done on secure servers.
All processing of your Personal Data shall be conducted according to the data protection principles as follows:
Personal Data must be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently;
Personal Data must be accurate and kept up to date with every effort to erase or correct;
Personal Data must be processed in a manner that ensures the appropriate security.
In addition, we have appropriate security measures in place designed to prevent Personal Data from being accidentally or unlawfully lost, used or accessed. We limit access to your Personal Data to those who have a genuine business need to access it. We take steps designed to ensure that those processing your Personal Data will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We also have procedures in place to respond to data security breaches. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
7. Information about other individuals
