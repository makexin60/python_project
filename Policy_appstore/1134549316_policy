What others are saying
[Our dog] has a severe case of anxiety to the point where he has been prescribed Xanax. We hate drugging him, and with this app, we don't have to. The music is a natural Xanax! We save the Xanax for the nights we just want complete quiet, but the music is soothing as well and I sleep just fine with it.

We got a new puppy and because she gets into so much stuff we keep her in a crate well she went mental in the crate I tried to sit with her and i tried to sing to her i even put the crate beside the couch so I can lay beside her still she kept freaking out as soon as i tried this app out played one song and she stopped immediately and fell asleep this app is my saviour
