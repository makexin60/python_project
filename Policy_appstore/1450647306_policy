5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We may use personal information for the following business purposes:
to communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle;
to create and administer an Oracle single sign-on (SSO) account (also referred to as an ‘Oracle Account’) and to deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management;
to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process orders for Oracle products and services;
to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services;
to manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems; and
to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
We may use personal information for the following commercial purposes:
to administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters;
to market our products and services or related products and services, and to tailor our marketing and sales activities to your or your company’s interests; and
to provide select business-to-business services to Oracle customers using publicly available information about companies which may include personal information such as the name of a company’s CEO that is publicly available.
These purposes are described below in further detail.
To communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle
If you get in touch with us (such as by submitting contact forms on our sites, reaching out to us via Oracle Sales chat, attending Oracle events or other occasions, sending an email or by visiting social media platforms), we process information about you to communicate with you and to respond to your requests or other inquiries. We can also process personal information to interact with you on third party social networks.
To create an Oracle SSO account and deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management
When you choose to register with us (such as to make use of our communities), we need to process the personal information provided by you so that we can create an Oracle account for you. Please note, this only applies to personal information controlled by Oracle, not personal information Oracle processes on behalf of our customers.
To engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process purchases of our products and services
If you place an order for our products and services, or if you provide services to Oracle, our employees, customers or partners as a supplier or business partner, Oracle processes information about you to engage in and administer the relevant transactions (such as by sending invoices and making payments), administer your order, and help you get started and adopt our products and services (e.g., by contacting you to activate your Cloud services credits). If you download products or services from our sites, Oracle uses information about you to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you did not experience problems in the download process).
To analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services
We may process personal information in order to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, including for quality assurance and training purposes, as well as for marketing and sales campaigns. This includes processing personal information to conduct surveys to improve Oracle products and services. In case the sites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, create a profile, post comments, opportunities or other content, or communicate directly with another user or otherwise engage in networking activities on Oracle sites, Oracle may process personal information when moderating these activities.
To manage the security of our sites, facilities, networks and systems
We may collect site use data for security and operations management to help keep our sites, facilities, networks and systems secure, or to investigate and prevent potential fraud, including ad fraud and cyber-attacks and to detect bots.
To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business
In some cases, we have to process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process personal information in the performance and operation of our business, such as to conduct internal audits and investigations or for finance and accounting and archiving and insurance purposes.
To administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters
If you subscribe to our magazines (such as “Oracle” or “Profit”), we process information about you to administer your subscription to our magazines (including the renewal process) and newsletters.
To market our products, services, events, or related products and services and to tailor marketing and sales activities
Oracle may use information about you to notify you about new product releases and service developments, events, alerts, updates, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns and promotions (including via newsletters). Oracle may also use personal information to advertise Oracle’s products and services or related products and services, and also to have our distributors, resellers or partners notify you about our products or services or their related products or services (such as via joint sales or product promotions). We do our best to tailor your website visit, marketing experience and our communications to your expressed interests. This happens, for example, if you sign up for an Oracle community or program like the Oracle Partner Network or Oracle Technology Network.
If you attend an event, Oracle may process information about you gathered in relation to the event and can share information about your attendance with your company. Oracle may also permit designated event partners or conference sponsors to send you up to two communications related to your event attendance. Please note that our partners or conference sponsors may directly request information about you at their conference booths or presentations, and their use of your information that you provide to them will be subject to their privacy policies.
We may also process your personal information to post testimonials on our sites, but will first obtain your consent to use your name and testimonial.
To provide select services to Oracle customers using publicly-available information which may include personal information such as the name of a company’s CEO
For some business-to-business services, we may collect the publicly available names of company directors and officials to better understand the status of these companies and help inform our services which relate to providing customers information about other companies.
6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?
For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, the UK and other relevant jurisdictions, our basis for processing is the following:

consent
where so indicated on our sites at the time your personal information was collected, or further to our
legitimate interest

Contact information such as your email address or phone number collected online on our sites or offline from our interactions with you at Oracle events and conferences, and used for direct marketing and sales activities will be retained for as long as we have an active (customer) relationship with you. We treat you as an active contact if (i) you have interacted with Oracle or updated your contact details and preferences in the past 18 months; and (ii) you have not made a deletion request.
If you have reached out to us via Oracle Sales chat, we will delete all chat transcripts 90 days after the chat has concluded.
If you have reached out to us via our support line and you have not opted out of call recording, we will delete call recordings 60 days after the call has concluded unless otherwise specified during the call.
If you have visited an Oracle facility, the personal information needed to allow you to enter the facility will be held for one year after your last visit for records retention purposes.

Oracle may process Services Personal Information for the processing activities necessary to perform the Services, including for creating an Oracle services account to access Oracle products and services, for testing and applying new product or system versions, patches, updates and upgrades, and resolving bugs and other issues You have reported to Oracle.
2. Customer instructions
You are the controller of the Services Personal Information processed by Oracle to perform the Services. Oracle will process your Services Personal Information as specified in Your Services order and Your documented additional written instructions to the extent necessary for Oracle to (i) comply with its processor obligations under applicable data protection law or (ii) assist You to comply with Your controller obligations under applicable data protection law relevant to Your use of the Services. Oracle will promptly inform You if, in our reasonable opinion, Your instruction infringes applicable data protection law. You acknowledge and agree that Oracle is not responsible for performing legal research and/or for providing legal advice to You. Additional fees may apply.
3. Rights of individuals
You control access to Your Services Personal Information by Your end users, and Your end users should direct any requests related to their Services Personal Information to You. To the extent such access is not available to You, Oracle will provide reasonable assistance with requests from individuals to access, delete or erase, restrict, rectify, receive and transmit, block access to or object to processing of Services Personal Information on Oracle systems. If Oracle directly receives any requests or inquiries from Your end users that have identified You as the controller, we will promptly pass on such requests to You without responding to the end user.
If you are an end user and you have questions about your choices regarding the disclosure and use of Services Personal Information provided to Oracle, please consult directly with the organization that collected your information from you.
4. Security and confidentiality
Oracle has implemented and will maintain technical and organizational measures designed to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Services Personal Information. These measures, which are generally aligned with the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard, govern all areas of security applicable to the Services, including physical access, system access, data access, transmission, input, security oversight, and enforcement.
Oracle employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of personal information. Employees’ obligations include written confidentiality agreements, regular training on information protection, and compliance with company policies concerning protection of confidential information.
See
additional details
regarding the specific security measures that apply to the Services are set out in the security practices for these Services, including regarding data retention and deletion, available for review.
5. Incident Management and data breach notification.
Oracle promptly evaluates and responds to incidents that create suspicion of or indicate unauthorized access to or handling of Services Personal Information.
If Oracle becomes aware and determines that an incident involving Services Personal Information qualifies as a breach of security leading to the misappropriation or accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Services Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed on Oracle systems that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of such Services Personal Information, Oracle will report such breach to You without undue delay.
As information regarding the breach is collected or otherwise reasonably becomes available to Oracle and to the extent permitted by law, Oracle will provide You with additional relevant information concerning the breach reasonably known or available to Oracle.
6. Subprocessors
To the extent Oracle engages Oracle affiliates and third-party subprocessors to have access to Services Personal Information for the purpose of assisting in the provision of Services, such subprocessors shall be subject to the same level of data protection and security as Oracle under the terms of Your order for Services. Oracle is responsible for its subprocessors’ compliance with the terms of Your order for Services.
Oracle maintains lists of Oracle Affiliates and subprocessors that may process Services Personal Information. Additional information is available to You via My Oracle Support (
https://support.oracle.com
) Document ID 2121811.1, or other applicable primary support tool provided for the Services.
7. Cross-border data transfers
Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and Services Personal Information may be processed globally as necessary in accordance with this policy. If Services Personal Information is transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, Oracle will take adequate measures designed to protect the Services Personal Information, such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to the terms of the EU Model Clauses or other adequate transfer mechanism as required under relevant data protection.
In the event the services agreement between You and Oracle references the
Oracle Data Processing Agreement for Oracle Services
(“DPA”), further details on the relevant data transfer mechanism that applies to Your order for Oracle services are available in the DPA. In particular, for Services Personal Information transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, such transfers are subject to Oracle’s Binding Corporate Rules for Processors (BCR-P) or the terms of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. For Services Personal Information transferred from the United Kingdom (UK), such transfers are subject to the UK Addendum or other appropriate transfer mechanism.
Oracle also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (collectively, the “DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, regarding the collection, use, and retention of Services Personal Information when You and Oracle have agreed by contract that transfers of such information from the EEA, United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), or Switzerland will be transferred and processed pursuant to the applicable DPF for the relevant Services. Oracle will then be responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as a subprocessor on our behalf do the same. Oracle shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its subprocessor processes Services Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Oracle proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Oracle has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPF Principles with regard to Services Personal Information (as described above) that is transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and/or Switzerland to the United States when specified in a relevant contract. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Services Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF program, and to view Oracle’s certification, please visit
Data Privacy Framework website
.
Please see the
Data Privacy Framework website
or refer to this list of U.S. entities covered under Oracle’s DPF self-certification. With respect to Services Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the DPF, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Oracle’s compliance with the DPF.
8. Audit rights
To the extent provided in your order for Services, You may at Your sole expense audit Oracle’s compliance with the terms of this Services Privacy Policy by sending Oracle a written request, including a detailed audit plan, at least six weeks in advance of the proposed audit date. You and Oracle will work cooperatively to agree on a final audit plan.
The audit shall be conducted no more than once during a twelve-month period, during regular business hours, subject to Oracle’s on-site policies and regulations, and may not unreasonably interfere with business activities. If You would like to use a third party to conduct the audit, the third party auditor shall be mutually agreed to by the parties and the third-party auditor must execute a written confidentiality agreement acceptable to Oracle. Upon completion of the audit, You will provide Oracle with a copy of the audit report, which is classified as confidential information under the terms of Your agreement with Oracle.
Oracle will contribute to such audits by providing You with the information and assistance reasonably necessary to conduct the audit, including any relevant records of processing activities applicable to the Services. If the requested audit scope is addressed in a SOC 1 or SOC 2, ISO, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA or similar audit report issued by a qualified third party auditor within the prior twelve months and Oracle provides such report to You confirming there are no known material changes in the controls audited, You agree to accept the findings presented in the third party audit report in lieu of requesting an audit of the same controls covered by the report. Additional audit terms may be included in Your order for Services.
9. Deletion or return of Services Personal Information
Except as otherwise specified in an order for services or required by law, upon termination of services, Oracle will return or delete any remaining copies of Your production customer data, including any Services Personal Information, located on Oracle systems or Services environments. Additional information on data deletion functionality is provided in the applicable Services descriptions.
