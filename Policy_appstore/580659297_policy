CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Privacy and Security
We take protecting your personal information seriously
Privacy Statement
Keeping your personal information safe and secure is a top priority. Learn about what information we collect, how we use it and how we protect your privacy.
Consumer privacy
We know protecting your personal information is important to you—and it's important to us as well. That's why we implement top-of-the-line security for your accounts and provide you with useful information to help you protect yourself and your finances.

CCPA
provides California consumers with specific access, correction, data portability and deletion rights. View the
CCPA
Privacy Notice for details on how to submit a verifiable consumer request to exercise your rights.
Canadian residents

Unique identifiers
You need a valid access code to access certain account and financial information.
Encryption
We use Transport Layer Security technology to ensure data is protected in transit.
Security guarantee
Be confident knowing that you're covered against unauthorized transactions on your accounts.
Timeout
Your session in our online application will automatically end after a period of inactivity.
Security for all your accounts
Our secure login process for Digital Banking is one more way we're working hard to protect your financial information.
Additional protection for your business
We use multi-factor authentication, or
MFA
, to better protect your financial information against cybercriminals.
Fraudsters are impersonating First Citizens and targeting customers through texts and phone calls. These criminals are attempting to steal your credentials and personal information to perform fraudulent transactions by accessing your accounts.
First Citizens will never text, email or call you to request security codes or other sensitive personal information. Phone numbers on caller
ID
s can be spoofed to display as First Citizens.
Please stay vigilant if you receive text messages or phone calls that appear to be from First Citizens requesting information about your account activity. It’s always safer to report a suspicious text as potential phishing instead of selecting a malicious link.
Here are some tips to remain vigilant:
Never open suspicious links in text or emails.
Always navigate to FirstCitizens.com to access the banking login page or locate the customer service phone number.
While we send texts to verify debit and credit card transactions, the link won't send you to the First Citizens login page. We'll never follow up a debit or credit card text with a phone call.
Account numbers, user
ID
s, passwords and other sensitive information should never be shared over the phone with an unsolicited caller or through a link in an unsolicited text.
If you receive an unsolicited call from someone claiming to be from First Citizens and asking for your account or other sensitive information, please end the call and call us.
And if something looks suspicious or you're just not sure if a communication is legitimate, please contact us at 1-888-

As added assurance, we have a banking history that spans more than 125 years. As one of America's largest family-controlled banks, we're known for our stability, financial discipline and long-term focus. Our time-tested strategies ensure that we'll be here for you both now and in the future.
What can I do to prevent identity theft?
We take protecting your personal information seriously and use state-of-the-art security technology to safeguard your account information. There are also some simple steps you can take to increase the security of your personal information.
The first thing you can do is to use strong passwords and user
ID
s. Hackers always go for the most obvious passwords and login
ID
s. So think of a phrase, song lyric or quote and add a few capital letters, numbers and symbols. And never use personal information such as family names, birthdates or phone numbers.
It's also important to not share your personal information to anyone who contacts you by phone, web, email or text message. Personal information includes your Social Security number, account numbers or any other information that can be used to personally identify you.
To report suspicious activity, contact us immediately at
866-567-7760
.
You can also place a fraud alert on your credit file to prevent fraudsters from opening new accounts or making changes to your existing accounts. You only need to notify one credit bureau—the one you choose will notify the other credit bureaus.

How can I protect my accounts from fraud?
If you receive a suspicious email or text message, don't respond, select links or open attachments. If we reach out to you by phone, we won't ask for confidential information like your card PIN, access code or online banking password.
How do I recognize a scam?
Be on the lookout for phone calls, emails or texts from even seemingly legitimate companies that either solicit your assistance or offer to help. Never give out your Social Security number, bank account numbers or other personal information to companies or individuals unless you initiated the conversation.
