What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser and/or your device. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit one of our Sites. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites and Services to, among other things, track the activities of visitors, help manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and third parties use clear GIFs in emails to help track email response rates, identify when emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Some cookies collect the personal information entered into a form on our Sites and  your IP address, the duration of your browsing session, your browser type and your operating system.
We use cookies, chatbots, tracking technology and the personal information they collect for the following reasons: to remember browsing preferences such as local language; to remember details about your previous visits to a Site in order to personalize and improve your browsing experience; to administer and organize a Site; to analyze use of the Site in order to make improvements to the Site; and to compile statistics, and understand and improve the usage of our Site.
First and third-party cookies:
whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the domain placing the cookie.
First-party cookies
are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies placed by
www.telestream.net
).
Third-party cookies
are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.
Persistent cookies:
these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
Session cookies:
these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our Sites or Services.

INFORMATION FOR EU/UK INDIVIDUALS
When we act as Data Controller.
If we process your personal information in our capacity as a data controller, the following applies:
We collect, use, and share your personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this. This may be because:
Our use of your personal information is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (for example when you choose to purchase software from us);
Our use of your personal information is in our legitimate interest as a commercial organization (for example in order to make improvements to our products and services and to provide you with information you request); you have a right to object to processing as explained in the section below titled Your Legal Rights;
Our use of your personal information is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have (for example, where we are required to disclose personal information to a court); or
Our use of your personal information is in accordance with your consent (for example, when your consent to the receipt of marketing communications is required by local law).
If you would like to find out more about the legal bases on which we process personal information, please contact us using the details below.
Your Legal Rights.
Subject to certain exemptions, and in some cases dependent upon the processing activity we are undertaking, EU/UK individuals have certain rights in relation to your personal information:
Right to access, correct, and delete your personal information:
You have the right to request access to the personal information that we hold about you and (a) the source of your personal information; (b) the purposes, legal basis and methods of processing; (c) the data controller’s identity; and (d) the entities or categories of entities to whom your personal information may be transferred.
You also have the right to request that we delete your information. We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or deference of legal claims.
Right to restrict the processing of your personal information:
You have the right to restrict the use of your personal information when (i) you contest the accuracy of the data; (ii) the use is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data; (iii) we no longer need the personal information for the relevant purposes, but we require it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our personal information use justified on our legitimate interests verification as to whether we have a compelling interest to continue to use your data.
We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where: (i) we have your consent; (ii) to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iii) to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
Right to data portability:
To the extent that we process your information (i) based on your consent or under a contract; and (ii) through automated means, you have the right to receive such personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller.
Right to object to the processing of your personal information:
You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.
Right to obtain a copy of personal information safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction:
You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the EEA/UK.
Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority:
You have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you have concerns about how we are processing your personal information.

If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, please send us a request to gdpr@telestream.net. In your message, please indicate the right you would like to exercise and the information that you would like to access, review, correct, or delete.
We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing the personal information requested to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.
If we process your personal information as a data processor:
For certain activities where we provide services to our customers, we act only on the instruction of those corporate customers. In those situations, the corporate customer is the Data Controller for that purpose. Where we process your data in our capacity as a data processor on behalf of the Data Controller, the processing of your data will not be governed by this Policy, but you can contact the corporate customer directly to learn about their processing of your personal information and to exercise your rights, or we will forward your request directly to our corporate customers.

Telestream generally maintains servers and systems in the United States hosted by service providers. We also may subcontract the processing of your personal information to, or otherwise share your personal information with, other third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence. Where required by applicable laws, we will take steps to ensure that any transfer of personal information outside of the originating jurisdiction is managed to protect your privacy rights and to will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. As a result, where the personal information that we collect through the Site, Services, or in connection with providing services to or administering our relationship with a corporate customer is transferred to and processed in the United States or anywhere else outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or UK for the purposes described above, we will take steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA or UK, including entering into data transfer agreements, using Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on other valid transfer mechanisms.
Where applicable, you are entitled to receive a copy of the contractual safeguards implemented to protect your personal data during such transfer. You can obtain a copy by contacting us using the information in the Contact Us section.
