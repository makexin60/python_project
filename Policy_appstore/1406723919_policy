Did you know that natural strawberries contain more vitamin C than oranges? And they also have a lot of copper, useful for healthy hair, and nitrate, a valuable aid for oxygenating the blood.

The
Natural Strawberry Mixer is made with only NATURAL flavors and colorants
, preserving the true essence of fresh strawberries. It's ideal for frozen cocktails, from Daiquiri to the classic Strawberry Caipiroska, and perfect for creating smoothies, giving you endless possibilities to unleash your creativity.

Amarena cherries in syrup are a typical ingredient of Italian gastronomy. These small cherries have a sweet and slightly bitter flavor, and are harvested when ripe to produce syrup. They can be used as decorations for ice cream, spoon desserts, cakes, and many cocktails.

The production process involves harvesting the cherries, selecting the best ones, immersing them in a sugary syrup, and adding natural marasca flavors (a variety of cherry that gives "maraschino" its name) to enhance their characteristic taste. The cherries are then preserved in airtight glass jars to maintain their flavor and texture.

Available in a 400 g format, ideal for the most demanding bartenders and mixologists.

For those who love complex and fresh tastes.

Mango is a fruit rich in nutrients, in fact its pulp contains fiber, vitamin C, polyphenols and carotenoids. It is originally from Asia and in fact Mixer selects the best from India and picked at the perfect moment of ripeness.

Its flavor is particular because it can recall a mix of peach, orange and pineapple; it is refreshing and tasty. For these reasons it becomes an interesting ingredient in different varieties of cocktails, from daiquiri to spritz with prosecco and lime juice or prosecco and lemon juice with a sprig of rosemary.
