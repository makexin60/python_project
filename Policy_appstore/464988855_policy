At Nest, we take your privacy seriously.
This Privacy Statement for Nest Products and Services (“Privacy Statement”) describes information that Nest Labs, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Nest”) collect, use, share, and store, including personal information (i.e., information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably used to infer this information).
This document focuses on information related to the operation of Nest products and services, including the Nest Learning Thermostat™, Nest Protect: Smoke + Carbon Monoxide™ Alarm, Nest Cam™, Dropcam™, Nest Hello™, Works with Nest™, and other products from Nest (collectively, “Nest Products”). In this Privacy Statement, the expression “Nest Products” also includes our Web Apps, Mobile Apps, and Subscription Services as defined in our
Terms of Service
.
We provide additional details about how we collect and use information from our public web sites in our
Privacy Policy for Nest Web Sites
.
Our Pledge:
We will be transparent
about the different types of information we collect and how we use them.
We will ask your permission
before sharing your personal information with third parties for purposes other than at your request or to provide Nest’s Products, and to do so only when we think they will provide you with a welcome additional service.
We will use best-in-class data security tools
to keep your data safe and protect the Nest Products from unauthorized access.
Your Permission:
Permission for data collection and processing. By using Nest Products, you agree to allow us to collect and process information as described in this Privacy Statement.
International data transfers. Your personal information may be collected, processed and stored by Nest or its service providers in the United States and other countries where our servers reside. Please be aware that the privacy protections and legal requirements, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, in some of these countries may not be equivalent to those in your country. If you are using Nest Products in the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law, you agree to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and other countries where Nest operates. We have provided you with more information below as to how we protect your personal data when it is transferred internationally:
How does Nest protect my personal information when it is transferred internationally?
What information does the Nest Learning Thermostat collect?
The Nest Learning Thermostat collects:
Setup information you provide
Environmental data from the Nest Learning Thermostat’s sensors
Direct adjustments to the device, including temperature or settings
Heating and cooling usage information
Technical information from the device
Setup information you provide
:
When you install the Nest Learning Thermostat, you’ll be asked several questions in order to help us create an initial program of temperature settings that will keep you comfortable. For example, we’ll ask for information like whether your thermostat is located in a home or a business, or like your home address or postal/ZIP code. This information helps us to customize your experience by, for example, retrieving weather information for your neighborhood or by enabling Home/Away Assist to automatically switch the behavior of Nest products in your home when you leave and when you come back. In addition, the Nest Learning Thermostat pulls information directly from your heating and cooling (HVAC) system to learn its capabilities – such as if it has heating and cooling or is a heating-only system. Answering these questions helps us to set up an initial program that will keep you comfortable.
Environmental data from the Nest Learning Thermostat’s sensors
: We collect data from several sensors built into the Nest Learning Thermostat. These sensors collect data such as current temperature, humidity and ambient light in the room. They can also sense whether something in the room is moving. This helps your Nest Learning Thermostat keep you comfortable when you are at home and save energy when you are away. For example, if the Nest Learning Thermostat senses that you’ve entered the room after an extended period of time, it can adjust the setting to a preferred temperature, based on an assumption that you’ve just woken up or returned home. Similarly, if a light goes off or no one is moving in the room, the Nest Learning Thermostat may turn the temperature down sometimes to help save energy.
Direct adjustments to the device
: If you change settings like temperature on the Nest Learning Thermostat, it records and feeds that information to the Nest algorithms to learn your desired comfort level in different situations.
Heating and cooling usage information
: Every time your system turns on and off, Nest records the time and duration during which your system was on in order to offer you features such as usage history.
Technical information from the device
: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with the Nest Learning Thermostat, we record your Nest Learning Thermostat model and serial number, software version, and technical information such as battery charge level.
What information does Nest Protect collect?
Nest Protect collects:
Setup information you provide
Environmental data from the Nest Protect’s sensors
Technical information from the device
Setup information you provide
: When you install Nest Protect, you’ll be asked for information like your home address or postal/ZIP code as well as where in your home you’re installing it. This information helps to customize your experience by, for example, enabling Nest Protect to inform you where an event is occurring, or to better schedule features like Sound Check to run during certain hours of the day.
Environmental data from Nest Protect’s sensors
: We collect data from several sensors built into Nest Protect. These sensors collect data such as smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels, current temperature, humidity and ambient light in the room. They can also sense whether something in the room is moving. By recording this information, Nest Protect can do things like detect smoke and CO in your home, and give you alarms and warnings. For example, if Nest Protect sees that smoke or CO levels are rising, it will give you a Heads Up before the danger reaches emergency alarm levels and tell you what the danger is.
Nest Protect 2nd generation also contains a microphone, which enables Nest Protect to deliver certain enhanced features. Specifically, Nest Protect emits sound samples during Safety Checkup or Sound Check that the microphone will capture to verify that the speaker and horn are functioning.
Technical information from the device
: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with Nest Protect, we record your Nest Protect model and serial number, software version, and technical information such as sensor status, Wi-Fi connectivity, and battery charge level.
What information does Nest Cam, Dropcam, and/or Nest Hello (collectively, “Nest Cam”) collect?
Nest Cam collects and enables you to collect:
Setup information you provide
Environmental data from Nest Cam sensors
Video and audio signals and data
Facial recognition data to enable Familiar Face Alerts feature
Technical information from the device
Shared content
Information input during setup
: When you install Nest Cam, you’ll be asked for certain basic information like your camera name, camera description, home address, ZIP/postal code, as well as where in your home you’re installing Nest Cam. This information is used to personalize your experience – for example, to tell you which device is triggering a notification.
Environmental data from the camera’s sensors
: We collect data from several sensors built into Nest Cam. These sensors collect data such as device temperature and ambient light in the room. By recording this information, Nest Cam can know, for instance, whether it’s dark and it should turn on night vision.
Video and audio signals and data
: Nest Cam enables you to determine the purpose and the means for which you collect video and audio signals data. When you enable the recording or streaming features of your Nest Cam, we may record and process video and/or audio recordings from the device, subject to your instruction, configuration and settings. This may include capturing and emailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. If you instruct us by setting up your camera and choosing to receive mobile notifications, we may process information from your Nest Cam to send you alerts when something happens. In addition, if you have the recording features enabled, we will capture, process and retain video and audio data recordings from your device for the duration of your recording subscription period (for example, 5, 10 or 30 days) and you will be able to access those recordings using the Services during that time.
Facial recognition data to enable Familiar Face Alerts feature
: If you choose to use the familiar face alerts feature on your Nest Cam, we will process face images and underlying face prints for the purpose of enabling your device to recognize familiar faces and to notify you of familiar and unknown people. Using the app and your account, you control whether this biometric processing occurs. Depending on where you live and how you configure the Products and Services, you may need to get explicit consent to scan the faces of people visiting your home.
Technical information from the device
: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with Nest Cam, we record your Nest Cam model and serial number, software version, and technical information such as Wi-Fi signal strength.
Saved and Shared Content
: Nest Cam enables you to determine the purpose and the means for which you save and share content. You may save and may choose to share certain content like video clips, live video streams, images, captions, and comments for other people to access using the Services. We will collect and store information that will allow us to save or share your content at your instruction through the Services.
Nest Cam is primarily intended for purely personal or household use. However, data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of Nest Cam. You (not Nest) are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use Nest Cam. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home that you are using Nest Cam and/or obtain their explicit consent depending on the purpose and the means of your processing activities. Note in particular that recording and sharing clips that involve other people, public spaces and/or scans of peoples’ faces may affect individuals’ privacy and data protection rights.
What information does Nest Secure (including Nest Guard, Nest Detect, Nest Tag and Nest Connect) collect?
Nest Secure collects:
Setup information you provide
Data from device sensors
Usage and performance information
Technical information from the device
Information input during setup
: When you install Nest Secure, you’ll be asked for certain basic information such as home address, ZIP/postal code, the location of where in your home you’ve installed your Guard and Detect devices, and custom labels for those devices. This information is used to personalize your experience—for example, to tell you which device is triggering a notification or an alarm, or by enabling Home/Away Assist to automatically remind you to arm the Nest Secure system when you leave the house.
Data from device sensors
: We collect data from several sensors built into Nest Secure devices. For example, Nest Guard can detect motion, and Nest Detect can detect motion or whether a window or door is open or closed, depending on how you’ve set up the device in your home. These devices can sense whether something in the room is moving and then sound an alarm and/or send you a notification. Sensors also collect data such as device temperature and ambient light in the room.
Usage and performance information
: We collect information about your use of Nest Secure, including activities you perform (such as arming or disarming the system or changing settings), activities Nest Secure performs (such as sounding an alarm or sending a notification), your responses to our notifications, and which Nest Secure products you add to your Nest account.
Technical information from the device
: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with Nest Secure, we record device model and serial number, software version, and technical information such as sensor status, Wi-Fi connectivity, error logs, power status and battery charge level, and whether product features are working properly.
What information is shared among multiple connected Nest Products?
If you have multiple Nest Products interfacing with one another, the products will share certain information with each other, such as data on whether something in the room is moving, temperature data, and the occurrence of smoke or CO alarms. This sharing may occur locally among connected devices (both Nest and third-party devices). Sharing can also occur between Nest Products and your mobile device or application, or among Nest's servers.
Nest offers a Home & Away Assist feature that uses the information collected from your Nest Products and, if you enable it, the location of a paired phone, to determine whether anyone is home or away. You can configure your Nest Products to react to the determination of “Home” or “Away” status.  For instance, your Nest cameras can turn on when you are away and turn off when you are home.
How does my Nest Product or account interact with third parties?
If I use Works with Nest to connect third-party products and services to Nest, will information be shared? When you choose to connect third-party products and services through Works with Nest, you are shown details about any proposed exchange(s) of data between Nest and the third party that is providing the product or service. Nest or the third party will instead (or also) ask for consent to control the products that you have connected. Your consent is required to allow any of these exchanges or requests for control and you will be able to revoke it at any time.
Is information shared with or received from third parties, outside of the Works with Nest program? Nest may share information with third parties with your permission. For example, when you enroll in a rewards program for Nest Products offered by our partners – such as Rush Hour Rewards or Safety Rewards – you may be asked for your permission to share certain data between Nest and our partner. Nest requires your permission before sharing information in these circumstances. We may also receive information from our partners and other sources and combine that with the information in your Nest account. For example, in order to offer rewards programs, we might receive information (such as which of our partners offers services where you live) to determine eligibility and efficacy of our programs.
Additional information about the limited circumstances in which information from your Nest account may be shared with third parties is described below in the section titled "In what circumstances does Nest share my information?".
Any Nest data that you choose to share with a third party is governed by that third party’s privacy policy while in that party’s possession.
Any data that Nest receives from third-parties will be processed and stored by Nest and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Statement. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data that is a part of your Nest account or the Nest logs.
What additional information does Nest collect and store when a user connects a Nest Product to the Internet or creates an account?
Wi-Fi Network Information
: To connect your Nest Product to our Services, or to access your Nest Product over the Internet from a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, you will need to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. During setup, the Nest Product will ask for your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password to connect to the Internet. It will save this information on the device, along with your IP address, so that you can access it and control it from your computer, smartphone or tablet, and so that it can communicate with Nest servers and download software updates.
Once connected to your Wi-Fi network, your Nest Product regularly sends the data described in this Privacy Statement (excluding your Wi-Fi password) to Nest to provide you with the Services.
Additional Authorized Users
: Nest may provide you with the ability to enable additional authorized users to access your account. If you do so, the additional authorized users may control and view all of your devices, content, and Works with Nest connections. Invited users may also add additional authorized users to your account, so be careful to add only those you trust. An invited user must have or create a Nest account, and information about invited users (like email address, name or changes to product settings) will be stored with your account.
Email Addresses
: When you create a Nest account, we collect and store your email address. From that point forward, your email address is used for communications from Nest. In addition, Nest may provide you with the ability to enable individuals to access your account as additional authorized users, or to invite other individuals such as friends or family to share access to your content such as recorded video footage. We will ask you for the email address of any such individuals and automatically send an email invitation on your behalf. Nest stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation services.
Basic Profile Information
: Your account allows you to provide certain basic profile information like your name and profile photo. Names and profile photos may be shown to others in connection with the Services. In addition, if you download the Nest Mobile App, we may collect and store your mobile device identifiers (such as IDFA, AAID, or other device identifiers). For example, if you invite someone as an additional authorized user, he or she will be able to see your name and photo. You should only use photos you are willing to make public.
Mobile location data
: You may choose to enable features like Home/Away Assist or device pairing. If you do this, you’ll be asked for permission to share location data from your mobile device.  If you grant this permission, the Nest app uses standard location services built into iOS and Android. This data may be processed or combined with data from other products to enhance features like Home & Away.
Bluetooth data
: Bluetooth-enabled Nest Products (such as Nest Protect 2nd generation and Nest Cam) may broadcast an identifying signal wirelessly. This is used to connect with your Bluetooth-enabled devices (such as a smartphone or tablet) in order to deliver features like easy setup or App Silence.
Remember that when you visit our Sites, we collect personal information as described in our separate
Privacy Policy for Nest Web Sites
. Like most Internet sites, we routinely record log entries (including information such as your IP address) and technical information (such as your browser type and version) when your browser, mobile device or Nest Product contacts our servers.
How does Nest use the information it collects?
We use this information to provide, develop and improve Nest Products and services, including to make assessments and recommendations about products, safety, or energy use. We may use your contact details to send you this information, or to ask you to participate in surveys about your Nest use, and to send you other communications from Nest.
We may also use this information in a non-identified form for research purposes and to help us make sales, marketing, and business decisions. For example, we use aggregated user information about the number of active thermostat users in a particular state to help us decide what energy companies might be good partners, and aggregated smoke and CO alarm data to study emergency alarm rates across our customers.
We may use service providers to perform some of these functions. Those service providers are restricted from sharing your information for any other purpose.
We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while it is transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our servers. Depending on your location and type of data, Nest may process your personal information on servers that are not in your home country.
In general for purposes of applicable law (e.g., GDPR), Nest is a controller of the information collected in connection with the Products and Services. However, in the case of “Video and audio signals and data” and “Facial recognition to enable Familiar Face Alerts feature” you are the controller of these data and Nest is a processor.
Our legal bases for processing information
If European data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we process your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, based on the following legal grounds:
When we’re providing a product or service
We process your data to provide and support a product or service you’ve asked for under a contract, including but not limited to delivering our Terms of Service.
When we’re pursuing legitimate interests
We process your information for our legitimate interests and those of third parties while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means we process your information for things like:
offering and improving Nest Products and services
developing new products and features
understanding how people use our products and services
performing research that improves our services for our users and benefits the public
sending you direct marketing and other communications from Nest
protecting against harm to the rights, property, and safety of Nest, our users, and the public
detecting, preventing or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security or technical issues with our services (including using a Google service such as
reCAPTCHA
)
maintaining and improving the integrity of our computing systems, and protecting our users’ data security
enforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service
When we’re complying with legal obligations
We process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we’re responding to a legal process or an enforceable governmental request.
With your consent
We ask for your consent to process your information for certain specific purposes and give you the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
In what circumstances does Nest share my information?
Under no circumstance do we share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the activation and delivery of Nest Products and services without asking you first. Period. We do not rent or sell our customer lists.
The following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:
With your permission: We may share personal information when we have your permission. One example of this would be if you invite another user to access the Products on your account as an additional authorized user. Another example is if you sign up for programs offered by our partners (e.g., energy or insurance companies); if you do this, we may share certain information with the partner. This could include things like your enrollment information and the activation status of your device. If you connect third-party devices and services to your Nest Products through the Works with Nest program, you are shown information about any proposed exchange of data. Nest or the third party will request your consent to these exchanges on your behalf and you can change your mind at any time. When you use third-party products and services integrated with the Nest Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those products and services.
For external processing: We have vendors, service providers, and technicians who help with some of our processing and storage,including helping to answer your questions. They may also assist with monitoring our servers for technical problems. These technicians (as well as Nest employees) can access certain information about you or your account in line with this work but these technicians are not allowed to use this data for non-Nest purposes. We also have strict policies and technical barriers in place to prevent unauthorized employee access to video data.
As part of business transitions: Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the items sold or transferred. We will request a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.
For legal reasons: We will share personal information with third parties if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to (i) meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request; (ii) enforce Nest policies or contracts, including investigation of potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Nest, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
We may share non-personal information (for example, aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. For example, we may publish trends about energy use or elevated carbon monoxide levels in the home. This information may also be shared with other users to help them better understand their energy usage compared to others in the Nest community, raise awareness about safety issues, or help us generally improve our system. We may also share non-personal information with our partners, for example, if they are interested in providing demand-response services or other incentive programs. We take steps to keep this non-personal information from being associated with you and we require our partners to do the same.
If you select an outside party for the purchase, installation or service of your Nest device and share your personal information, we cannot control the collection, storage or sharing of information collected by that party. For example, if you buy a Nest Learning Thermostat from a retailer, the retailer may collect personal information as part of the transaction. Or the party that installed the device may retain information that you provided to them to assist them in servicing the device if needed. Always check the privacy policies for any company that collects your personal information.
What choices do I have and how can I delete my personal information?
Nest generally stores your personal information on Nest’s servers until
you delete
or edit it, or for as long as you remain a Nest customer in order to provide you with Nest Products. In addition, Nest may store your personal information to resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws.
As described above, some information is processed and stored directly on the Nest device. Personal information from Nest devices is encrypted while it is being transmitted to Nest.

In certain circumstances, the Data Privacy Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. Nest is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).
Nest remains responsible for any of your personal information that is shared under the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for external processing performed on our behalf, as described in the “In what circumstances does Nest share my information” section.
We may share, as described in this Privacy Statement, information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, and third parties. We may disclose information in response to legal process and lawful requests by public authorities in the United States and other countries for the purposes of law enforcement and national security.

This Privacy Policy for Nest Web Sites describes information Nest Labs, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Nest”) collect, use, share, and store, including personal information (i.e., information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably used to infer this information).
This document focuses on information related to the operation of the public websites available at nest.com and nest.com sub-domains (each, a “Site”), including our online store.

Website Use Information: Like many websites, we and our third-party partners analyze log file information and other data collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technology, to collect information about your browsing behavior when you visit our Site, including for example, your browser type, domains, page views, IP address, referring/exit pages, information about how you interact with our Site’s webpages and with third-party links, traffic and usage trends on the service, etc. We use session cookies to keep you logged in while you use features of our Site; these disappear after you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies, which stay in your browser and allow us to recognize you when you return to the Site. We use this to remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it, to better understand how you use our website and products and services, to diagnose and fix technology problems, and otherwise enhance our Site, products, and services. In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Site. We track this click-through data to help us measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. We also use third-party analytics tools (including Google Analytics) to assist us with analyzing and improving our service. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to change the settings of your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you set your browser to reject cookies, parts of our Site may not work for you. Please note, depending on your type of device or browser, it may not be possible to delete or disable all tracking mechanisms on your device.
Your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information for analytic and internal purposes. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you may wish to visit
allaboutcookies.org
).
We permit third-party advertising partners to use cookies and other technology to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites when you use our Site. For example, we use advertising services provided by third-party ad partners, such as Google Display Network and AdRoll, to market our services to you on other websites and online services. Through a process called “retargeting,” each service places a cookie on your browser when you visit our Site so that they can identify you and serve you ads on other sites around the web based on your browsing activity. To avoid use of this information for advertising by these third-party ad partners, you can change your browser settings to reject cookies or to notify you when cookies are set and you could select the Do Not Track option on your browser, though we have no control over and cannot confirm whether these third party ad parties honor the Do Not Track browser signal. Additionally, many advertising companies are members of the NAI or DAA and/or provide opt-outs on those industry pages at
networkadvertising.org/choices
or
aboutads.info/choices
.
Third-Party Sites and Features: Our Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties and may include social media features such as Facebook and Twitter buttons (such as “Like,” “Tweet” or “Pin”). These third-party sites may collect information about you if you click on a link and the social media sites may automatically record information about your browsing behavior every time you visit a site that has a social media button. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature, not by our privacy policy. We do not control what information these third parties collect. Please review your privacy settings on your social media sites and think carefully before clicking on links which may take you to a third-party website.
Minors: Our Site does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13.
DATA SHARING: Under no circumstance do we share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the delivery of Nest Products and services without asking you first. Period. We do not rent or sell our customer lists.
The following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:
With your permission: We may share personal information when we have your permission. One example of this would be if you sign up for programs offered by our partners (e.g., energy or insurance companies). If you do this, we may share certain information with the partner. This could include things like your enrollment information and the activation status of your device. If you connect third-party devices and services to your Nest Products through the Works with Nest program, you are shown information about any proposed exchange of data. Nest will request your consent to these exchanges on your behalf and you can change your mind at any time. When you use third-party services integrated with the Nest Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern those services.
For external processing: We have vendors, service providers, and technicians who help with some of our processing and storage, including helping to answer your questions. They may also assist with monitoring our servers for technical problems. These technicians (as well as Nest employees) can access certain information about you or your account in line with this work but these technicians are not allowed to use this data for non-Nest purposes. We also have strict policies and technical barriers in place to prevent unauthorized employee access to video data.
As part of business transitions: Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the items sold or transferred. We will request a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.
For legal reasons: We may provide information to a third party if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so for legal reasons. For example, to respond to legal process, or comply with state and federal laws (or the applicable laws of foreign countries other than the United States).
We may share non-personal information (for example, aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. For example, we may publish trends about energy use or elevated carbon monoxide levels in the home. This information may also be shared with other users to help them better understand their energy usage compared to others in the Nest community, raise awareness about safety issues, or help us generally improve our system. We may also share non-personal information with our partners, for example, if they are interested in providing demand-response services or other incentive programs. We take steps to keep this non-personal information from being associated with you and we require our partners to do the same.
Your personal information may be collected, processed and stored by Nest or its service providers in the United States and other countries outside the European Union where our servers reside. As a result, your personal information may be subject to legal requirements, including lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities, in those jurisdictions.
SECURITY: Nest takes security seriously and cares about the integrity of your personal information. We use commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological methods to transmit and store your data securely. However, Nest cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
RETENTION: Nest generally stores your personal information on Nest’s servers until
you delete
or edit it, or for as long as you remain a Nest customer in order to provide you with Nest Products. In addition, Nest may store your personal information to resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings

Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Information Google collects
What types of data are collected when I use Google Nest's connected home devices and services?
Google's
Privacy Policy
applies to our
connected home devices and services
and explains what information we collect; why we collect it; and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. In addition, read our
commitment to privacy in the home
to understand safeguards Google Nest applies in handling your information.
Categories of data collected
In addition to the data described in the
Privacy Policy
, when you use our
connected home devices and services
, we save:
Setup information
you provide when you set up your account and any device using our apps, such as device name, device type, and information about your home, including your address, ZIP code, and where the device is placed.
Sensor data
such as detected motion, ambient light measurements, temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, and smoke levels as well as information derived from this data, such as sleep information. Learn more about the information sensors send to Google, as well as examples of how that information provides and improves Nest devices and services, in the
sensors in Google Nest devices guide
.
Audio and video data
from devices with cameras and microphones, and information derived from this data, such as coughing and snoring event information (if you've set up this feature), facial recognition information (if you've set up this feature), and person, object, sound, motion or activity detection information, all subject to your permissions and settings. For example, we store your video footage if you choose to receive video storage services from Google for your Nest Cams.
Device usage data
that includes:
Manual device interactions (such as manually adjusting the temperature on the Nest thermostat), heating and cooling usage data (such as when your heating or cooling system turns on and off), device state, settings, and features used.
Device usage data is also collected when a device is used with a Google service (such as Google Assistant, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Calendar, Google Fit, or Google Meet), or with a third-party service (such as Spotify or Pandora), such as voice or touch interactions, long presses on the device, or other device interactions or adjustments, including related device state, settings, and features used.

Nest thermostats
Setup information you provide
When you install a Nest thermostat, you're prompted for information that will help your thermostat work correctly. For example, is your thermostat located in a home or a business, and what's the ZIP code of the building? This information helps us customize your experience by, for example, retrieving weather information for your neighborhood. In addition, the Nest thermostat pulls information directly from your heating and cooling (HVAC) system, as applicable, to learn its capabilities — for example, does your system provide heating and cooling or heating alone? Answering these questions helps us set up an initial program that will keep you comfortable.
Data from device sensors
Google collects data from several sensors built into the Nest thermostat, such as current temperature, humidity, motion, and ambient light in the room. Those sensors can also sense presence in the room. This helps your Nest thermostat keep you comfortable when you're at home and save energy when you're away. For example, if the Nest thermostat senses that you've entered the room after an extended period of time, it can adjust the setting to a preferred temperature based on an assumption that you've just woken up or returned home. Similarly, if no one is moving in the room, the Nest thermostat may turn the temperature down to help save energy. This also helps enable features like Home/Away Assist and Home and Away Routines to automatically switch the behavior of other Nest devices in your home based on when you leave and come back.
Nest Protect
Setup information you provide
When you install Nest Protect, you'll be asked for information like your home address or ZIP code, as well as where in your home you're installing your device. This information helps to customize your experience by, for example, enabling Nest Protect to inform you where an event is occurring, or to better schedule features like Sound Check to run during certain hours of the day.
Data from device sensors
We collect data from several sensors built into Nest Protect, such as smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels, current temperature, humidity, and ambient light in the room. They can also sense whether something in the room is moving. By recording this information, Nest Protect can do things like detect smoke and CO in your home and warn you of danger. For example, if Nest Protect detects that smoke or CO levels are rising, it gives you a Heads-Up alert before the danger reaches emergency alarm levels and tells you what the danger is. Nest Protect 2nd Generation also contains a microphone, which enables Nest Protect to deliver certain enhanced features. Specifically, Nest Protect emits sound samples during a Safety Checkup or Sound Check that the microphone will capture to verify that the speaker and horn are functioning.
Nest Cam and Nest Doorbell (collectively, "Nest Cam")
Setup information you provide
When you install Nest Cam, you'll be asked for certain basic information like your camera name, camera description, home address, ZIP code, and the location in your home where you're installing Nest Cam. This information is used to personalize your experience — for example, to tell you which device is triggering a notification.
Data from device sensors
We collect data from several sensors built into Nest Cam such as device temperature and ambient light in the room. By collecting this information, Nest Cam can know, for instance, whether it's dark and it should turn on Night Vision.
Video and audio signals and data
When you enable the recording or streaming features of your Nest Cam, we process video and audio signals and data from the device, subject to your instruction, configuration, and settings. This may include capturing and sending you portions of this data by push notification or email or analyzing the data to identify motion, sound or other activity. When your Nest Cam is on, we process the video and audio signals and data to identify activity. Subscribing to Nest Aware provides enhanced activity detection on your Nest Cam.
If you instruct us by setting up your camera and choosing to receive mobile notifications, we may process information from your Nest Cam to send you alerts when something happens. In addition, if you enable the recording features, we'll capture, process and retain video and audio recordings from your device for the duration of your recording subscription period (for example, 5, 10, 30 or 60 days), and you'll be able to access those recordings using our services during that time.
In some regions, we process facial recognition data to enable familiar face alerts, subject to your instruction, configuration, and settings. If you choose to use this feature on your Nest Cam, we'll process face images and underlying facial recognition data for the purpose of enabling your device to recognize familiar faces and to notify you of familiar and unknown people. Using the app and your account settings, you control whether this biometric processing occurs. Depending on where you live and how you configure the device, you may need to get consent to scan the faces of people visiting your home.
Saved and shared content
You may save and choose to share certain content like video clips, live video streams, images, captions, and comments for other people to access using Google services.
Data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of Nest Cam. You're responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use Nest Cam. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home that you're using a Nest Cam and/or obtain their explicit consent, depending on the purpose and the means of your processing activities. Note in particular that recording and sharing clips that involve other people and/or scans of people's faces may affect individuals' privacy and data protection rights. When you use the Nest Cam with a Google Account, you're also subject to these supplemental
Nest Terms of Service
.
Note that your camera will be accessible from any visual Assistant devices connected to your account. Additionally, some Google smart display devices that have cameras, such as the Nest Hub Max, may also allow you to optionally enable the camera to operate as a Nest Cam.

Displays (Nest Hub, Nest Hub (2nd gen), and Nest Hub Max)
Setup information you provide
When you set up your Google Nest smart display, you'll be asked for certain basic device setup information, such as your home address and the room in your home where the device is located. You can also choose to set up the Google Assistant to receive personalized experiences, such as by setting up Voice Match or Face Match, and you can also choose to enable specific features such as using your Nest Hub Max as a Nest Cam, setting up Sleep Sensing using your Nest Hub (2nd gen), using Google Meet, and so on.
Data from device sensors
We collect data from several sensors built into our smart displays, such as Soli sensor, capacitive touch signals and ambient light in the room. By collecting this information, a Nest Hub smart display can know, for instance, when and how to adjust the display to your home environment. Some device sensors allow us to offer optional features such as Sleep Sensing or Quick Gestures, that you can choose to turn on or off at any time.
Video and audio data
We collect data from the microphones built into Google Nest smart displays, as well as the camera built into Nest Hub Max, subject to your permissions, configurations and settings. Nest Hub smart displays include features that rely on sending audio recordings and video footage to Google to work—for example, Google Meet calling or home monitoring with the built-in Nest Cam—as well as camera sensing features that enable you to personalize or control your experience without sending video or images from your Nest Hub Max to Google after setup. Other features may process your audio only on your device, for example the Nest Hub (2nd gen), lets you use your microphones to track sleep sound disturbances like coughing or snoring.
Health and wellness data with Sleep Sensing
Sleep Sensing on your Nest Hub (2nd gen) lets you track your sleep, breathing, the time of day, and the light and temperature in the room, sound disturbances like your coughing and snoring, to help you understand your sleep, show relevant insights and educational content, and to develop and improve Google's health and fitness services. Several safeguards are built into Sleep Sensing:
Sleep Sensing does not rely on a camera. It uses
Motion Sense's low-power radar
to detect movement and breathing. No distinguishable images of your body or face are generated or used for Sleep Sensing with Motion Sense.
Sleep Sensing is off by default. You choose when to turn it on and can turn it off at any time. You can even temporarily pause it through your on-device settings.
You can also customize your settings in what you would like Sleep Sensing to track. For example, you could tell your Nest Hub to not record sound disturbances like coughing and snoring, or you can choose to not receive personalized insights and suggestions from Google Fit. You can review and delete your sleep data at any time in Google Fit.
Your sleep data is handled responsibly. Your coughing and snoring sound data doesn't leave the Nest Hub, only audio events are sent to Google servers. Consistent with our
commitment to privacy in the home
, your sleep data is not used for ad personalization.
Since Sleep Sensing monitors the spot you usually sleep in, children, pets, and other family members sleeping in that spot will affect your data. Device placement, motion, and other device sensors may cause inaccurate readings. Anyone with access to your Nest Hub can review and delete your most recent sleep session. If someone nearby coughs or snores while Sleep Sensing is on, this feature may process and attribute those sounds to you. Updates to this feature may improve its accuracy, for example, by using Motion Sense to exclude nearby noises from your coughs and snores. Please ensure you inform people nearby that this feature may process their sounds, and get their permission before you turn it on.

How Google uses data to improve services
How is data used across my connected home devices and services to enable helpful experiences?
Google's
Privacy Policy
applies to our
connected home devices and services
and explains what information we collect; why we collect it; and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. In addition, read our
commitment to privacy in the home
to understand safeguards Google Nest applies in handling your information.
At Google Nest, our products use data from your connected home devices and services to make them more helpful to you. This means providing Google services and experiences related to the connected home, improving and personalizing them and developing new ones, helping to maintain safety and security across Google services, and keeping you informed of relevant Google products, services, and updates.
Some examples of how we use data to make features and services more helpful:
Provide, improve and personalize the services
: The temperature and humidity sensors in your Nest thermostats help keep your home comfortable while saving energy. Your Nest Wifi network data helps optimize your Wi-Fi performance, and your device stats and usage data help improve your device's performance and reliability.
Motion Sense
allows us to offer Sleep Sensing on Nest Hub (2nd gen).
Supporting useful features
: Home/Away Assist and Home and Away Routines uses activity sensors across multiple Nest devices in your home to automatically switch the behavior of Nest devices in your home when you leave and when you come back. Your Nest Aware sound detection feature can work across multiple Nest devices to help you detect, for example, the sound of glass breaking in your home.
Developing new features:
We aggregate data to develop algorithms or use it to troubleshoot and improve the performance, safety, and reliability of all our connected home devices and services. Examples include using temperature and humidity data from our devices to measure the impact of environmental conditions on battery life. We also used ambient light and temperature sensor data aggregated from thermostats from many customers to determine that direct sunlight can cause thermostats to think it's warmer than it actually is, so we introduced Sunblock, a new feature, to help your thermostat adjust for this so it sets the correct temperature.
Working with first- and third-party devices & services
: Multiple devices in your home can work with each other, share data, and respond to events — for example, your Nest Hub and Nest doorbell can work together to tell you when someone is at your door, and your Google Home device can also be used to control the temperature on your Nest thermostat. This makes it easy for anyone in your home to control these devices. Your device can also work in concert with Nest's connected home services when you subscribe to them — for example, as a Nest Aware subscriber, you can opt in to relevant alerts from your Nest Cam. Subject to your settings, your device can also work with third-party devices (such as light bulbs or locks) and services (such as Spotify or Pandora).
Working with Google services such as Google Assistant
: Various Nest devices, such as Nest Cam IQ Indoor and Nest Hub Max, allow you to enable the Google Assistant or other Google services on the device. Your device interactions via the Google Assistant or other Google services (such as YouTube) may be used to personalize your Google experiences, including to show you relevant ads. For example, the text of your voice interactions with the Google Assistant can inform your interests for ad personalization. You can
delete past voice interactions
with your Assistant at any time and can even
turn off ad personalization
across your Google experience. Go to your
Google Account
to review and manage your privacy settings.
Keeping you informed of Google products, services & updates
: We might inform you of connected home services such as energy and home safety programs, and some of Google's promotions will be personalized to you based on your use of Google's devices and services. For example, we may promote an energy savings program to you depending on your thermostat usage or your temperature sensor readings, or we may promote an upcoming Google Nest device to you if you use multiple Google connected home devices. But we'll always respect your choice about whether or not you want to receive promotional emails from Google. Go to your
Google Account
to review and manage your account settings and the Home app to manage your home settings.
We're always working on new ways to improve how you experience Google services. We'll keep you updated on new experiences and product integrations Google offers, and if we change how your information is used, we'll inform you of the changes and continue giving you appropriate means to manage your connected home information.
How do I learn more about personalized advertising and turn off personalized ads?

personalized advertising
and
controlling the ads you receive
. Turn off ad personalization in your
Ad Settings.
How can I better understand the limits on Google's use of data from my connected home devices and services?
Read our
commitment to privacy in your home
where we've explained that for all our
connected home devices and services
, we will keep your video footage, audio recordings, and home environment sensor readings separate from advertising, and we won't use this data for ad personalization. However, when you interact with your Assistant, the text of those voice interactions can inform your interests for ad personalization, as explained in more detail below. You can always review your Google settings to control the ads you receive, including
opting out of ad personalization completely.
In addition, Google has placed specific use limits on your device usage data (such as your manual device adjustments) from certain Nest devices, as well as certain location data collected via the Nest and Home apps. Here are more details:
Interacting directly with your Nest device without a Google service
If you interact directly with your Nest device (such as your manual thermostat changes) without using a Google service like the Google Assistant, your device usage data
is not used for
ad personalization
. Learn more about how
Google ads work
and how to
control the ads you receive
. This specific limit on your device usage data is true for the following Nest devices only that were historically used with Nest Accounts: Nest thermostats, Nest Cams, Nest video doorbells, Nest alarm systems, Nest door locks, and Nest smoke & carbon monoxide alarms.
This data processed as you interact directly (i.e., without using a Google service like the Assistant) with your Nest device isn't accessible in
My Activity,
and turning off your Google
activity controls
doesn't have an effect on the collection or retention of this data. That's because we use this data for more limited purposes of providing Google services and experiences related to the connected home, improving and personalizing them and developing new ones, helping to maintain safety and security across Google services, and keeping you informed of relevant Google products, services, and updates (including promoting our connected home devices and services to you, as explained above), and the data is core to how your connected home devices and services work. This data is deleted when you delete your account and is subject to Google's
account deletion practices
.
Interacting with your Nest device via a Google service
If you use any Nest device with a Google service like the Google Assistant, we may use your activity data to influence the ads you receive (e.g., when you say to your thermostat, "Hey Google, set my temperature to 70 degrees," or play a YouTube video on your Nest Hub). These Google services can include: Google Assistant (or the Works with the Google Assistant program), YouTube, Google Maps, Google Calendar, Google Meet, Google Home app and the like. You can manage your ads settings, including turning off ad personalization completely, at
ad settings
. You can manage your activity settings, including turning off Web & App Activity completely, in
My Activity
.
Location data
Your device's location as established by the
Location History
setting in your Google Account is separate from Nest's
Home/Away Assist
and
Home and Away Routines
features. Location History does not influence these Nest features (nor is your phone or tablet's location data collected by these features used to establish Location History in your Google Account).
I'm thinking of migrating from my existing Nest Account to a Google Account. How do I learn more?
Check out the
What's Happening with Google Nest FAQs
, where you can learn more details. If you migrate to Google, your Nest data will be associated with your Google Account. Google will handle this data as described in the Google
Privacy Policy
and this
Help Center FAQ
. You will also be subject to the Google
Terms of Service
, as supplemented by these
Nest Terms of Service
. If you're based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, unless stated otherwise in any additional terms, Google services (including the Nest services if you migrate) are provided by Google Ireland Limited, a company incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland (Registered Number: 368047), and located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
The Nest Account FAQ
also answers questions about accounts for the Nest app and explains the steps to migrate your Nest Account to a Google Account.
If you don't migrate your Nest Account to a Google Account, you'll remain subject to
existing terms and privacy policies of Nest Labs, Inc
.
Sharing your information
When you use Google's
connected home devices and services
, your data may be shared with third parties as explained in the Google
Privacy Policy
(and in more detail below). We also explain in this section how information is shared across your Google Nest connected home devices and services and among members of your Google Nest home.
How can I manage or revoke other people's access to the devices in my home?
You can add people to your Google Nest home, such as family members or roommates. Only invite people you trust because members of your home receive broad rights as explained in
Share a home and devices in the Google Home app
.
Remember that guests with physical access to your home may be able to access and interact with your device. For example, they might adjust your thermostat, view video displayed on your smart display, or even interact with mic and camera buttons on the device. If you prefer that guests not use your device, you may want to consider putting it away when you have guests in your home.

Can I use both the Google Home and Nest apps?
Yes, you can use both the Google Home app (Home app) and Nest app with your Google Account to manage the devices in your home, although some devices may require you to use the Nest app whereas others require the Home app. For example, to use Google Nest Mini, you'll need to use the Home app.
How will my Home and Nest apps work together to improve my home experience?
If you use the same Google Account across the Nest and Google Home apps, over time, you'll have a consistent view of your Google home and its members across both apps. Your data will be handled as explained in Google's
Privacy Policy
and you'll have certain controls and settings consolidated in the Google Home app. Go to
share devices in your home with other people
to learn more.
Because both apps will show the same home, actions in one app will affect the home as reflected in the other app. For example:
If you're a new user of the Nest app and sign in to the Nest app with the Google Account you use with your Home app, your existing Google home will be visible in the Nest app automatically, and your home across your Nest and Home apps will be linked.
You'll need to use the Google Home app (not the Nest app) to manage the family members in your home, or to rename or delete your home.
If you're the owner of a Nest home and another member of the home removes you via the Home app, then it will unlink all the Nest devices associated with your Nest home in the Nest app, and you'll also lose access to the Nest home.
Supported devices that are added to a Nest home:
Become visible in the Google Home app under the same linked home
Are shared with all other home members for a designated home
Are accessible via your Google Assistant
What information is shared among multiple connected home devices?
If you have multiple devices in your home that use Google services, they can share certain information:
Locally, among Nest and third-party devices
: Nest and third-party devices can directly share information to provide more helpful experiences, such as whether something in the room is moving, what devices in your home are playing content via Cast, temperature data, and the occurrence of smoke or carbon monoxide alarms.
Locally, between Nest devices and mobile apps on your phone or tablet:
to enable content casting and related functionality, features like Home/Away Assist and Home and Away Routines, and certain cases where your device may function like a border router for other Nest devices.
Among Google servers in the cloud:
Google uses different storage systems for various home devices.

and
how your Nest products connect to each other and the internet
.
What data is shared when I use the services offered by Nest partners?
If you sign up for connected home services and programs offered by our partners — for example, energy or insurance companies — Google will share your personal information with your permission. When you use third-party services integrated with Google services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services.

What retention periods apply to my data?
You can read about Google's
data retention policies
, which address how long it takes us to delete your information, including your Nest data. You can also delete your structures (homes) and remove home members or devices at any time by managing your settings in your Home app.
Note that certain Nest products continue to work without an account. If you use those devices and services without an account, including after deleting an existing account, you will remain subject to Google's
Privacy Policy
,
Terms of Service
, and these supplemental
Nest Terms of Service
.
For example, after you delete your account, your Nest thermostat will still be able to control your heating and air-conditioning system, sense motion to determine whether to switch to Eco Temperatures, let you choose an automatic or manual schedule, and use other basic functions. It will also remember your Wi-Fi information. This means it will stay connected to the internet and continue to communicate with our servers. It may also receive software updates. The thermostat will send data and its originating IP address to our servers as long as it's connected to the internet. If you don't want data logging and software updates to continue, you should disconnect your thermostat from your Wi-Fi network. Go to
FAQs about accounts in the Nest app
to learn more.
How do I prevent sending certain usage and crash reports to Google?
When you have the "Help improve your device" setting turned on (for Nest devices with this setting available), usage data and crash reports are sent to Google in the background, to help us troubleshoot problems and improve services. Go to

https://nest.com/privacy:
It‘s where we get to decide who we invite in.
It‘s where private conversations stay private.
It‘s the place for sharing family recipes and taking first steps.
There‘s a trust between you and your home.
And at Nest, we value that trust above all else.
That‘s why you‘re in control of your information and your devices.
It‘s why we work hard to protect your data.
And why your info is not for sale.
To anyone.
If you invite us into your home, we have an unbreakable rule –
Your home deserves the same respect we give our own.
Privacy and control of your information is more important than ever.
Below you‘ll find the principles that guide our work every day.
Behind your front door, you get to be yourself. You also get to decide who can come in.
If you invite us in, we’ll respect your privacy and be a good guest.
The kids and your dog may not listen, but we do. We believe the best way to earn your trust is to keep you in control of your information. We only share personal information when you explicitly give permission. When you do give us this permission, we also let you know what personal info we’re sharing and why. And you can stop sharing your personal information at any time.
Privacy is important. Security is just as important. So we encrypt our connections to help keep your info safe.
We also stay up to date on the latest threats so we can be as vigilant as possible and make sure we double-bolt the doors.

Homes shouldn’t waste energy when no one’s there. They should let us know when the batteries in our smoke alarm are running low.
With Nest, data becomes savings on your energy bill and a smaller carbon footprint. It becomes an alert on your phone when something’s wrong. It becomes new features that make your home more and more thoughtful.
And we’re repeating ourselves, but this is important: your personal information is not for sale. To anyone.
You don’t hand out spare keys to everyone. Instead, they go to a neighbor you can rely on. When you buy a Nest device, it’s a lot like trusting us with a set of keys. And we know we have to keep your trust every day after that.
You can also kick us out of the house at any time. We have a Delete My Account feature that removes your personal information from our servers. Once you’ve deleted your account and turned off Nest’s WiFi connection, you’ll no longer be able to use some of the features we love, but we think you’ll still have the best thermostat and camera and smoke and carbon monoxide alarm out there.
And just as neighbors talk about what’s going on, we want your thoughts on this. So email us anytime at
privacy@nest.com
