General Rules on Competitions, Contests and Giveaways
Unless otherwise specified, GO will conduct all competitions, contests and giveaways (each a “Competition”) as described in this section and by entering or participating in a Competition, each entrant or participant (“Entrant”) agrees to these rules whether or not any separate additional specific terms apply to the Competition.
When entering or participating in a Competition, an Entrant may be eligible for a prize specified in the corresponding promotional material (the “Prize”). GO may reject an entry at its own discretion, provided that such rejection will not conflict with applicable law.
The Prize is non-transferable, non-exchangeable and no cash alternative is offered. In the event of a Prize being unavailable, GO reserves the right to offer an alternative prize of equal or greater value if circumstances beyond GO’s control makes it necessary to do so. To the extent permitted by law, the Competition Winner will be responsible for any and all taxes incurred in relation to receipt of the Prize.
Participation in a Competition does not automatically mean that the Entrant has won the Prize. A winning entry (the “Competition Winner”) will be chosen by random draw (performed by a computer process or supervised by an independent third party) or by a panel of individuals adjudicating the entries. Reasonable efforts will made to contact the Competition Winner but if the Competition Winner cannot be contacted or fails to reply to GO’s communication within the communicated timeframe, GO reserves the right to offer the prize to the next eligible Entrant. GO will not be liable if the Prize does not reach the Competition Winner for reasons beyond GO’s reasonable control.
Without prejudice to the “Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity” section, neither GO nor any Affiliates or Partners involved in a Competition will accept responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions, interruptions, deletion, or unauthorized access to Competition entries, or entries lost or delayed whether or not arising as a result of server functions, virus, bugs, or other causes outside GO’s, an Affiliate’s and/or a Partner’s control. IN NO EVENT SHALL GO’S AND/OR AN AFFILIATE’S AND/OR A PARTNER’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO ANY ENTRANT FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY COMPETITION OR ANY MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN RELATION TO A COMPETITION EXCEED THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE PRIZE.
GO reserves the right to cancel or amend the Competition and any associated terms and conditions. Any changes will be notified to the Entrants as soon as reasonably practical. If these terms do not, or do not clearly, cater for a solution to any matter which may arise, then GO shall have the sole discretion to decide finally on any such matter. GO’s decisions on any aspect of the Competition is final and binding and no correspondence will be entered into about it.
