About SeeOSC
SeeOSC was built from the ground up for digital artists who want to blur the lines between physical and virtual worlds. By leveraging OSC, you can send sensor data from your phone—accelerometer, gyroscope, touch coordinates etc, all while sending a Spout and receiving video streams output via Spout in real-time.
Create live visuals projected on-stage, all controlled by the tilt of a performer’s phone, prototype and develop interfaces rendered by a remote system, or create immersive interactive experiences driven by the camera and sensors of a mobile device. The possibilities are endless.
