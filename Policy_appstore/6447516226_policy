In addition, we limit access to your data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your data based on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have implemented procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
We also use technical data encryption tools such as the technology listed below.
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for transmitting data over the Internet. HTTPS employs TLS (Transport Layer Security) or its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt the communication between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., a web server). This encryption helps protect sensitive data, such as login credentials, credit card information, and other personal information, from being intercepted by unauthorized parties.
TLS (Transport Layer Security): TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end encryption and authentication for data transmitted over computer networks. It is the successor to SSL and is widely used to secure various types of communication, including web browsing, email, file transfers, and remote desktop connections.
SSH (Secure Shell): SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure remote login and command-line access to computers over an unsecured network. It provides encryption and authentication capabilities, protecting the transmitted data from eavesdropping, data tampering, and other security threats.
SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): SFTP is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management functionality over a secure, encrypted connection. It is an extension of the SSH protocol and is commonly used for securely transferring files between computers over an unsecured network.
OpenVPN: OpenVPN is an open-source virtual private network (VPN) software that implements secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections using SSL/TLS protocols. It allows users to securely access remote resources over an unsecured network by creating an encrypted tunnel between the client and the VPN server.
LDAP over SSL (LDAPS): LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services. LDAPS refers to the use of LDAP over an encrypted SSL/TLS connection, ensuring that the communication between the LDAP client and server is secure and protected from unauthorized access or eavesdropping.
Data retention
How long will you use my personal data?
We will only retain your data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your data, the purposes for which we process your data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
We store your data while you use our App.
In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data. To send an email to our address:
barmaluikvalrntinafd@gmail.com
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and treat it under the law. We do not allow our third-party services providers to use your personal data for their purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and under our instructions.
We do not use user data for sale (or any other commercial activity) to other companies. User data is used solely to ensure the App's functionality.
