Our Retention Policy
W

retain
Personal
Information
from
you
with
your
consent,
or
where
we
have
an
ongoing
legitimate
business
need
(for
example,
to
provide
you
with
a
service
or
other
information
you
have
requested
or
to
comply
with
applicable
legal
requirements).
When
we
have
no
on-going
legitimate
business
need
to
process
your
Personal
Information,
we
will
either
delete,
de-identify
or
anonymize
it,
or
,
if
this
is
not
possible
(for
example,
because
your
Personal
Information
has
been
stored
in
backup
archives),
then
we
will
securely
store
your
Personal
Information
and
isolate
it
from
any
further
processing
until
deletion
is
possible.
The
following
are
examples
of
how long we typically retain your Personal Information for legitimate business needs:
!
When
Y
ou
Interact

Sales,
Marketing,

Customer
Support:
W
e

your

, we must
retain your
information  for
a  period
of  two
(2)  years
following
the  date
of  your
last  recorded
assessment for a particular role
(“Assessment”).
As a result, if
you request deletion of any
information
prior
to
this
2-year
anniversary
,
we
must
wait
until
the
2-year
period
has
passed,
after  which
we
will
process
your
deletion
request.
If
you
do
not
have
any
recorded
assessments
for
a
role
during
the
last
two
(2)
years,
then
we
will
process
your
request within ten (10) business days of receipt.

we
are
obligated
to
retain
certain
information,
once
you
delete
your
Account
or
request deletion of your Personal Information, your Personal Information will cease being
visible
to
third
parties
through
our
Site,
regardless
of
whether
you

aggregate or de-identify our user
’
