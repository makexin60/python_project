. The Apps are available only to, and may only be used by persons who can enter into legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Apps are not available to minors. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, please do not use the Apps.
1. LIMITING COLLECTION
Tactus does
not collect information
about identifiable individuals through the Apps. There are no logins or accounts to use the Apps. An internet connection is not required after downloading/installing the Apps.
It is possible to add personal information to some Apps. There is a place to add an email address in most apps to facilitate sending results by email. Some apps allow users to add their own words, phrases, phone numbers, or pictures to provide personalized exercises. Some apps record audio of the user speaking for feedback; this audio can optionally be emailed with the report. The reports can be emailed, exported, printed, or otherwise saved to the device at the user’s discretion. None of the custom words, recordings, or reports are stored by or sent back to Tactus. They are stored locally on the device or wherever the user directs them. None of this personal information is required to use the Apps, but it is available functionality.
If you elect to provide an email address or elect to enter any other personal information to use the above functionalities, Tactus will use the email address and other personal information provided only for the purposes specified above.
The sale/purchase of the Apps is handed by Apple and Google. Users will have accounts and other information stored with these licensed sellers of the Apps, which are subject to their respective privacy policies.  Tactus is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by Apple, Google, or other third-party websites. Therefore, we suggest you examine those sites’ privacy statements to learn how your information may be collected, used, shared and disclosed. Tactus does not endorse, approve of, verify, attest to, or offer any representation or warranty regarding third party privacy practices.

You may withdraw your consent to the use of your email address as set out in this Privacy Policy at any time, by updating your preferences in the applicable App to remove reference to your email address. Withdrawal of your consent to the use of your email address will result in the email results delivery functionality being unavailable to you.
4. ACCURACY AND SECURITY
We take steps to ensure that your personal information is as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. If you believe that the personal information we have about you is not accurate or is incomplete, please update your information through the applicable App, or by email at

Your name, e-mail address, and IP address are all examples of data that may be personal information. “Cookies” may or may not be considered personal information, depending on the law applicable in your jurisdiction and the nature of the cookie.

Tactus may also anonymize, aggregate, or otherwise strip any Personal Information we collect of all personally identifying characteristics and may use or share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties for any purpose we deem appropriate.
We may use your Personal Information to contact you. Your Personal Information allows us to contact you by various methods, including mail, email, SMS message, app push notification, and telephone at the contact points you have provided to us. We will contact you to respond to your questions, proactively provide you with information about the Services that you use, inform you about the Website, the Software, and any related Services and to update you on changes to our Website, our Software, and any related Services. When you communicate online or by email, you should be aware that sending information over the internet is inherently insecure, as it can be intercepted or manipulated and retransmitted.
Personal Information that we collect may be uploaded, moved, stored, processed in, backed up and/or transferred between any of the countries in which we operate or may operate in order to enable us to collect, use, and/or disclose the Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You also acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information may be transmitted, uploaded, or moved across international borders in Tactus’ discretion, and you consent to the same.
5. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Any Personal Information provided by you, or that is derived automatically by or through the Website, the Software, and related Services is not sold, rented, or shared by us with any third party without your consent, except in the circumstances described in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your Personal Information to any of our employees, officers, insurers, professional advisers, agents, suppliers or subcontractors, to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
You acknowledge and agree that We may use and/or disclose your Personal Information, without notice, if legally permitted to do so according to the relevant provisions of the Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c.5, and/or any other relevant privacy enactment (collectively, the “Privacy Acts”). The Privacy Acts may permit the use and/or disclosure of Personal Information without notice if, for example: (a) the Personal Information could be useful in the investigation of a contravention of the laws of Canada, a province or a foreign jurisdiction; (b) the Personal Information is used or disclosed for the purpose of acting in respect of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual; and (c) the Personal Information is disclosed to comply with the edicts of the law, or to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court.

We may disclose your Personal Information if Tactus or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personal Information held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets, in accordance with applicable law.
You also acknowledge and agree that we may engage other companies and individuals (“Third Party Service Providers”) to perform some of the foregoing on our behalf, including service providers selected by you in your use of the Website, the Services, and the Software. We may disclose your Personal Information to one or more Third Party Service Providers who provide services for us or perform Services on our behalf. We make every effort to ensure any company with which we may share Personal Information protects that Personal Information and data in a manner similar to this Privacy Policy and to limit the use of such Personal Information to the performance of the services being provided to Tactus.
For example, a Third Party Service Provider may:
host and administer our Website, process and store data, and fulfill similar technology-related functions on our behalf or carry out any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy; and/or
provide analytics services to help us understand how our Services are used, and as otherwise required by applicable law, including confirming your identity to comply with “know your client” obligations.
These Third Party Service Providers may be provided with access to your Personal Information for such purposes. We make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Third Party Service Providers acting on our behalf are obligated to provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information to the level of protection that we provide.
6. CONSENT
If you apply for registration of an account or otherwise apply to use the Software, the Website, and the Services, provide Personal Information through the Services, or provide your Personal Information to us in any other way, you acknowledge your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information as set out in this Policy and applicable laws. If we want to use your personal information for a purpose that was not disclosed at the time of initial consent, consent will be sought at the time of this new purpose.
Withdrawal of consent.
You may withdraw your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy at any time. Withdrawal of your consent to the collection, use, and/or disclosure of your Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy may result in all or part of the Software, the Website, and/or related Services being unavailable to you. If you withdraw your consent to the collection, use, and/or disclosure of your Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy, Tactus reserves the right to limit your access or prevent you from accessing the Software, the Website, and/or any related Services.
Updating consent.
Subject to legal and contractual restrictions, you can, with reasonable notice to us, update your consent or withdraw your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information for specific purposes, other than the collection, use, and disclosure which is required for us to maintain your account with us and to provide Services that you sign up for and for which you were approved.
7. ACCURACY
We take steps to ensure that your personal information is as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. If you believe that the personal information we have about you is not accurate or is incomplete, please contact us by updating your information through our Services or the Software, or by email at
privacy@tactustherapy.com
. If you change your email address, you are required to update your information with us.
8. SAFEGUARDS
We use a variety of procedures and practices appropriate to the sensitivity of personal information to protect against loss, theft, and unauthorized access. Access to your information is restricted to those individuals and parties who require access for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. For example, Tactus may secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When Personal Information is transmitted to other web sites or third parties for the purposes specified above, we may also, or in the alternative, protect it through the use of encryption, such as by way of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Personal Information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our Third Party Service Providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. Personal Information we collect is managed from our offices in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Even though we have taken steps to help protect the Personal Information in our control, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. No security measures can provide absolute protection. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information you provide to us. While we take all reasonable measures to protect data, there is always inherent risk when providing Personal Information. The transmission of Personal Information and data over the Internet is inherently insecure, and there are no security systems that are completely safe or fool-proof against hacking or tampering.
You are solely responsible for controlling access to your account(s) associated with Software, and maintaining the confidentiality and security of your accounts and related password information. You are entirely responsible for all activities that occur on or through your account(s), and Tactus shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of any of your account(s) associated with the Software.
Personal Information is not kept by Tactus for any longer than is necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. Personal Information that is no longer required to fulfil the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy will be destroyed, erased, or made anonymous.
9. THIRD PARTY POLICIES AND LINKS
The Website may contain links to other third-party sites that are not governed by this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy will no longer apply once you leave our Website and visit another website. Additionally, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by third-party websites. Therefore, we suggest you examine those sites’ privacy statements to learn how your information may be collected, used, shared and disclosed. Tactus does not endorse, approve of, verify, attest to, or offer any representation or warranty with Tactus as to, the accuracy of the content of such websites that are linked or Internet resources that are linked from the Website. If you decide to leave the Website and access these third-party sites, you do so at your own risk.
Any links from our Website to other websites, or references to products, services or publications other than those of Tactus, do not imply the endorsement or approval of such websites, products, services or publications by Tactus.
