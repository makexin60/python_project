This market is worth over $6 trillion daily, with central and private banks, hedge funds, traders, and travelers worldwide open 24 hours a day, 5.5 days per week exchanging money at different prices.
Currency prices change every second, giving investors limitless opportunities to enter trades. And investors try to make money by correctly predicting the price movements of different pairs.

Trading is the buying and selling securities, such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities, to make a profit. And success depends on a trader's ability to be profitable over time.
Investors try to forecast market price movements and profit from buying or selling an asset at a higher or lower price. You can 'go long' and buy a security, hoping it will go up in value and give you a profit, or you can 'go short' and sell in the belief that it will go down in value.
