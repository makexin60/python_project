This data is initially processed within the EEA by their Irish entity, Shopify International Ltd. It is then exported from the EEA to their Canadian parent entity, Shopify Inc. This export takes place within their corporate structure. Data within Shopify Inc. is protected under PIPEDA, Canada's privacy legislation, which is considered adequate under the GDPR.

The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields are also considered adequate under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Shopify's Privacy Shield certification can be found on
PrivacyShield.gov.
Your order data will be held for the duration of 6 years from the end of the financial year in which the transaction was made (January 31st), to comply with our legal and contractual obligations. After this period it is anonymised and held for statistical / record keeping purposes, and any data that could be used to identify you will be deleted.

How do you use cookies?
What are cookies?
A cookie is a computer file consisting of letters and numbers which is installed on your device when you visit a website and which allow our website to recognise a user and retain that user’s preferences when they return. Cookies do not collect data, instead they serve to act as unique identifiers, or information caches, which can be used to identify a user’s preferences, settings or previous activity and which in turn enable website operators to provide an optimised, improved and more individualised browsing experience.
Some internet browsers will temporarily store website data using a process known as ‘caching’. The creation of a website cache may improve loading speed and responsiveness and, in some cases, provide offline functionality. Most internet browsers support HTML 5 which permits website caching. Website caching typically requires greater storage capacity than cookies which, in turn, may provide greater improvements in speed and functionality.
How do you use cookies?
Cookies distinguish you from other users of our website. We and our partners use cookies to store your regional shop preference, for website analytics and to allow you to make purchases and related payments. This allows us to optimise your individual browsing experience and improve our service to you.
We drop the following cookies on your device when you visit our website:
palace-shop-select: This tells us which of our shops that you have set as your preference.
palace-cookie-policy: This tells us whether you have been shown the banner informing you of our cookie policy.
Our partners including Shopify, Paypal and Google Analytics will also drop cookies on your device when you browse our site and make purchases. Details of the cookies they use, their purposes and further details are here:

How do I manage cookies?
Whilst we advise that you allow the installation of cookies on your browser or device when using our website, you are not obliged to do so and you can choose to reject cookies by adjusting the settings for your browser or device.

How do you use cookies? What are cookies?
A cookie is a computer file consisting of letters and numbers which is installed on your device when you visit a website and which allow our Website to recognise a user and retain that user's preferences when they return. Cookies do not collect data, instead they serve to act as unique identifiers, or information caches, which can be used to identify a user's preferences, settings or previous activity and which in turn enable website operators to provide an optimised, improved and more individualised browsing experience.
Our Website may display advertising from third parties, who may set their own cookies providing information about the advertisement and user preferences. If you require further information about these you should consult the relevant third party's privacy policy.
Use of our Website may also result in Local Shared Objects (LSOs), including ‘flash cookies', being stored on your device. LSOs have a similar function to cookies, but are designed to function with specific applications (such as Adobe Flash Player). We may use local storage facilities in order to provide you with both online and offline functionality for our Website. For example, local storage may be used to store Website content on the device for access when the device is not connected to the internet.
Some internet browsers will temporarily store website data using a process known as ‘caching'. The creation of a website cache may improve loading speed and responsiveness and, in some cases, provide offline functionality. Most internet browsers support HTML 5 which permits website caching. Website caching typically requires greater storage capacity than cookies which, in turn, may provide greater improvements in speed and functionality.
How do you use cookies?
Cookies distinguish you from other users of our Website. For example, we use them to keep track of the contents of your shopping cart once you have selected an item, to store delivery addresses if the address book is used. This allows us to optimise your individual browsing experience and improve our service to you. Our partners, including Shopify, Paypal and Google Analytics, drop cookies on your device when you browse our Website and make purchases.
How do I disable cookies?
While we recommend that you allow the installation of cookies on your browser or device when using our Website, you are not obliged to do so and you can choose to disable cookies and LSOs by adjusting the settings for your browser or device. You can also delete those which already exist using the settings on your browser and/or device (however, this may interfere with your use of our Website and adversely affect your browsing experience).
Analytics
We use third party services, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze online behavior data of users. These services may help inform, optimize, target and serve ads based your visits to our Website. We do this to better understand how you use the Website and Service, with a view to offering improvements for all users, and to tailor our business and marketing activities accordingly. If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics, please download and install the browser plugin at
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
. Users can also opt out of third party interest based advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's deactivation website at
www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
.
What about amendments to this Privacy Policy?
We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted unless we advise you otherwise. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a way that is adverse and materially different from the uses described in this Privacy Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt out. Your continued use of the Service after this Privacy Policy has been amended and you have been notified shall be deemed to be your continued acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy, as amended. We encourage you to bookmark this webpage and review this Privacy Policy regularly.
