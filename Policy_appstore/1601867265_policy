Poker does not collect any private personal information from the players.
Players can use any screen name of their choosing to create an account and start playing, or they can even play as guest, without specifying any screen name.
Optionally, players can create a login name and password of their choosing. The login name and password are completely arbitrary and are not required to carry
            any personally identifiable information. Creating a login name and password enables the players to play using the same account information, including
            their past winnings, by logging in from different devices.
Players can delete their account information at any time, by following the steps described below:
From the app:
tap on the edit icon next to your name at the top of the startup screen (player menu),
tap on the DELETE button at the bottom of the edit screen, and
tap on the CONFIRM button on the confirmation popup window.
