A.	Personal Information
Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, e-mail address, physical mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, and any personal photo or image representation.  We will collect, use and disclose personal information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
For users in the EEA, the legal basis for collection of this information is to provide you with the Services.
Please note that some non-personal information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other information in a way that enables you to be identified, but the same information is considered non-personal information when taken alone or combined only with other non-personal information.
B.	Non-Personal Information
Non-personal information, alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you.  CyberStep collects non-personal information about your use of Service and includes aggregated information regarding usage of the Service.  The non-personal information collected may include information related to your mobile device or computer system, including mobile device type, IP address, unique mobile device ID or other device identifiers, Media Access Control (MAC) address, telephone number of mobile device, country of registration (together, “

To send to you any physical prizes that you have requested we deliver to you, and to communicate with you about sending the prizes.
To send important notices, such as communications about your purchases and changes to our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy;
To send “push” notifications to your mobile device regarding the Service (for example, suggesting that you open the Service to take certain actions);
To provide in-game information regarding player achievements, such as leader boards;
To allow us to enable you to reset your password if you have forgotten it;
To provide technical support and respond to inquiries from you;
To prevent fraud and potentially illegal activities and enforce our Terms of Service; and
