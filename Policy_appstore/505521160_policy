We have no obligation to monitor or moderate any user's activity or use of the Website, however we retain the right at all times to monitor, retain and disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or regulatory authority request, to ensure that the services are properly used, that this agreement is being complied with or to investigate a suspected breach of this agreement.
5.4
We recognise that online security is an area of vital importance to you. It is imperative that you should be fully satisfied that your personal details are secure before you commence activities with us. In an effort to increase the security associated with the transmission of information via the internet communication (which is an insecure method of communication by its very nature) we use the TLS (Transport Layer Security) mechanism that is built into your browser to manage the communication between you and the website. This means that any text you provide is 'translated' into extremely detailed encrypted code. Your data is only retranslated into text once it is stored on our web server. Information such as personal details, credit or debit card numbers, passwords and all account details are automatically coded. In addition, we have installed the latest firewall and IDS/IPS technology. This process is intended to act as a secure barrier to detect any unauthorised access to our server immediately. Furthermore, our website utilises anti-fraud checks throughout all transaction and payment processes. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
5.5
Although we cannot completely guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the website, we will do our best to protect your personal data. You must understand, however, that while we will take the steps set out in paragraph 5.4, any transmission of data by you over the internet is carried out at entirely your own risk. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorised manner.

This information is outlined as part of our efforts to comply with Data Protection legislation and to ensure that we are open, honest and clear about user privacy.
7.3.2
How We Use Cookies
You may notice the presence of different types of cookies generated on your visit to this website. Cookies placed by BoyleSports, are called "first party" Cookies. Cookies may also be placed on your device by a party other than BoyleSports. Such cookies are known as "third party” cookies. Examples of the uses of third party cookies include collecting information about system performance and customer interaction.
While there are many different uses for first and third party cookies, the cookies used by us all fall into one of the following four main categories of cookies:
Strictly Necessary Cookies
Performance Cookies
Functionality Cookies
Targeting Cookies
Below is a description of the four types of cookies:
7.3.3
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These are cookies that are required for the operation of our site.  They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our site or provide payment services. We do not require your consent to place these cookies. Nevertheless, you may be able to block these cookies yourself on your device / browser, but restricting these cookies is likely to mean that our site will not work as you would expect, and certain functionality may be inoperable.
Without these cookies
you would be unable to place bets, play games or access your account so if you opt out of receiving these cookies, parts of our site will not work correctly and may not work at all.
A few examples of the ways in which we use strictly necessary cookies:
Allowing you to navigate smoothly through our websites;
Showing content in the best format for your device or browser and positioning it for your screen;
Keeping you logged in during your visit so that you don’t have to log in on every one of our websites each time you visit;
Enabling you to stream content without having to repeatedly adjust volume and viewing settings;
Enabling us to fulfil legal obligations in relation to fraud, money laundering, abusive transactions, other illegal activities or breach of our terms and conditions.
7.3.4
Performance Cookies
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our site when they are using it.  This helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.  We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our site, how they reached our site, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn't working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc.  This helps us to continuously improve our website.
Without these cookies
you will still be able to use and enjoy all the online features of our website.
7.3.5

7.3.6
Targeting Cookies
These cookies record your visit to our site, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.  This information will be used by us and third parties to make our site and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests.

To perform geotargeting, which allows our adverts to be displayed on third party webpages, based upon your location;
To perform site retargeting. A retargeting pixel (a tiny unit of code) on our webpage leaves a cookie in the user’s browser, which causes our adverts to be displayed or to not be displayed to you when you visit certain websites within the retargeting network (e.g. Google Display Network); and
To perform search retargeting, which allows our adverts to be displayed on third party webpages, based upon your previous web search activities.

We recognise that online security is an area of vital importance to you. It is imperative that you should be fully satisfied that your personal details are secure before you commence activities with us. In an effort to increase the security associated with the transmission of information via the internet communication (which is an insecure method of communication by its very nature) we use the TLS (Transport Layer Security) mechanism that is built into your browser to manage the communication between you and the website. This means that any text you provide is 'translated' into extremely detailed encrypted code. Your data is only retranslated into text once it is stored on our web server. Information such as personal details, credit or debit card numbers, passwords and all account details are automatically coded. In addition, we have installed the latest firewall and IDS/IPS technology. This process is intended to act as a secure barrier to detect any unauthorised access to our server immediately. Furthermore, our website utilises anti-fraud checks throughout all transaction and payment processes. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
5.5
Although we cannot completely guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the website, we will do our best to protect your personal data. You must understand, however, that while we will take the steps set out in paragraph 5.4, any transmission of data by you over the internet is carried out at entirely your own risk. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorised manner.

You may notice the presence of different types of cookies generated on your visit to this website. Cookies placed by BoyleSports, are called "first party" Cookies. Cookies may also be placed on your device by a party other than BoyleSports. Such cookies are known as "third party” cookies. Examples of the uses of third party cookies include collecting information about system performance and customer interaction.
While there are many different uses for first and third party cookies, the cookies used by us all fall into one of the following four main categories of cookies:
Strictly Necessary Cookies
Performance Cookies
Functionality Cookies
Targeting Cookies
Below is a description of the four types of cookies:
7.3.3
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These are cookies that are required for the operation of our site.  They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our site or provide payment services. We do not require your consent to place these cookies. Nevertheless, you may be able to block these cookies yourself on your device / browser, but restricting these cookies is likely to mean that our site will not work as you would expect, and certain functionality may be inoperable.
Without these cookies
you would be unable to place bets, play games or access your account so if you opt out of receiving these cookies, parts of our site will not work correctly and may not work at all.
A few examples of the ways in which we use strictly necessary cookies:
Allowing you to navigate smoothly through our websites;
Showing content in the best format for your device or browser and positioning it for your screen;
Keeping you logged in during your visit so that you don’t have to log in on every one of our websites each time you visit;
Enabling you to stream content without having to repeatedly adjust volume and viewing settings;
Enabling us to fulfil legal obligations in relation to fraud, money laundering, abusive transactions, other illegal activities or breach of our terms and conditions.
7.3.4
Performance Cookies
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our site when they are using it.  This helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

GAMSTOP Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
We are The
National Online Self Exclusion Scheme Limited
, sometimes referred to as NOSES or GAMSTOP (
“we, us, our”
).
We are a limited liability company registered in England and Wales. Our company number is 10504973.
We run
GAMSTOP
, a free self-exclusion service to help UK residents control online gambling. To run GAMSTOP we need to use your personal information.
This Privacy Policy (
“Policy”
) explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with and how long we retain it.
We have also provided important information regarding your rights in respect of the personal information we collect about you and how you can contact us.
This Policy was last updated 24th February 2025. We will update it again when necessary to reflect changes in our practices or the law.
To contact us about how we use your personal information please use the details set out
below
.
2. How does GAMSTOP work?
2.1. GAMSTOP
If you would like help controlling your online gambling, you can register for a six-month, one-year or five-year minimum period of self-exclusion with GAMSTOP. 
During your period of self-exclusion, GAMSTOP will help to prevent you from using gambling websites and apps run by gambling companies licensed by the Gambling Commission in Great Britain (
operators
).
2.2. Registration
Registration with GAMSTOP is straightforward. We just need you to provide some basic details. 
We will then verify your identity before completing registration. You can find out how to register for GAMSTOP on our website
https://www.gamstop.co.uk/register
.
2.3. Auto renewal
If you select a five-year minimum period of self-exclusion, you will have the option (either during registration or later from your GAMSTOP account) to use our auto renewal feature.
If you do select auto renewal, a new five-year minimum period of self-exclusion will begin immediately after the expiry of your current five-year minimum exclusion period.
This process will continue for four new five-year minimum exclusion periods or until you turn off auto renewal from your GAMSTOP account.
You may only turn off the auto renewal option during the last six months of a five-year minimum exclusion period. Consequently, if you automatically begin a new five-year minimum self-exclusion period, you shall remain self-excluded for at least a further five years. At that point it will be four years and six months until you again have the option to turn off auto renewal to prevent another further five-year minimum exclusion period from beginning.
After four years and six months has passed, you will be able to turn off auto renewal from your GAMSTOP account to prevent another further five-year minimum exclusion period from beginning.
If you do turn off auto renewal and your minimum exclusion period expires, you will remain self-excluded until you decide to remove your self-exclusion.
2.4. Operator checks
All
operators
are required to check whether their customers are registered with GAMSTOP. Consequently, once you are registered, every time you attempt to login or create an account with an operator, the operator will check to see if you are self-excluded.
2.5. Self-exclusion
When we inform an operator that you are self-excluded with GAMSTOP, that operator should prevent you from accessing its online gambling services.
You will have to contact operators directly about account closures and withdrawing any funds you may have. 
The details of how this will be done will depend on the operator in question and the return of any funds is not our responsibility.
2.6. Post self-exclusion
If you decide to remove your exclusion after your minimum period has expired, you must telephone our
Contact Centre
. 
We will then send you a removal email acknowledging your decision. Following a cooling-off period of at least 24 hours, during which you may change your mind, we will remove your self-exclusion.
After we remove your self-exclusion, we will inform operators for a seven-year period that you were previously self-excluded.
Operators do not have to prevent you from accessing online gambling services during this time. 
However, they may choose to prevent you from accessing online gambling services outside of the GAMSTOP service.
We have no influence over whether an operator prevents you from accessing online gambling services outside of the GAMSTOP service.
3. Information we collect
We obtain most of your information either from you, operators or our third-party verification providers –
TransUnion
and
Onfido
.
3.1. Primary email verification
Before you can register with GAMSTOP, you must provide us with your primary email address. 
We will send an email to this address with a link for you to verify it belongs to you. 
We collect the IP address of any device opening this email. 
Once you have verified your primary email address, you can continue to the GAMSTOP registration process.
You must use a private email address as your primary email address, as anyone with access to the email account could view any messages that may be sent to you or access your GAMSTOP details.
3.2. Registration
During the GAMSTOP registration process, we ask you to provide the following ‘registration data’:
Your title
Your first name
Your last name
Your current address and postcode and any postcodes you have lived at previously
Your date of birth
Any additional email addresses you currently use or have used in the past
Any mobile numbers you currently use or have used in the past
3.3. Identity verification
As part of registration, you must undergo an identity verification process. We have two external verification providers, TransUnion and Onfido. 
In a small number of cases, we also undertake verification manually ourselves.
TransUnion
TransUnion provides us with a series of questions only you should know the answer to. You must answer enough of the questions correctly to complete the TransUnion process.
TransUnion's
privacy notice
explains in more detail how TransUnion uses your personal information.
Onfido
Onfido uses facial recognition technology to compare a photo of you with the photo on your official photographic ID document. Onfido undertakes this process and holds this information on our behalf.
Manual verification
In some cases, it may not be possible for TransUnion or Onfido to verify you. 
We will let you know if this happens, in which case we will require you to provide official ID documents to our
Contact Centre
before you can use the GAMSTOP service.
3.4. Email confirmation
When you have successfully registered for a GAMSTOP self-exclusion, we will send an email confirming your registration. We will also send you an email confirming any auto renewal of your minimum period of self-exclusion.
We collect the IP address of any device opening these emails.
3.5. Reminder emails
You can opt-in for emails at registration or during your self-exclusion from your GAMSTOP account that remind you to update your registration data.
3.6. Gambling Operators
All operators are required to check if their customers have self-excluded with GAMSTOP. 
Operators must undertake checks on a daily basis and every time a customer attempts to login or register for an account.
To undertake these checks, operators send their customers’ data to us. 
The data we receive from operators is hashed and we only store this information as long as is necessary to perform the check and let the operator know if there is a match.
In addition to these checks, operators may provide us with details about attempts to log in to online accounts and other information that may be relevant to our provision of the GAMSTOP service.
A full list of the operators that participate in the GAMSTOP scheme is available
here
. 
We strongly recommend that you review the privacy policies of any operators you use to access online gambling services.
3.7. Incorrect identification
We may receive information from an operator, individual or other source that indicates that an individual has been incorrectly identified as being self-excluded, when, in fact, they did not register for self-exclusion with GAMSTOP.
In these situations, we may store certain personal information about that individual in order to build safeguards into our system to avoid that individual being incorrectly prevented from accessing operators' sites in the future. 
We will collect the personal information necessary to achieve this aim and will retain it for so long as it is needed.
3.8. Call recording
We record calls to our
Contact Centre
for training, accuracy and performance monitoring purposes. You will receive a message informing you that calls are recorded at the beginning of the call.
3.9. Information about other individuals
As part of the operation of GAMSTOP, we may receive personal information relating to individuals who have not registered for GAMSTOP. 
For example, GAMSTOP consumers when registering their own self-exclusion may add personal information relating to other individuals during the registration process or later via their online accounts.
We may also receive personal information relating to third parties in correspondence.
3.10. Accuracy
We may also collect personal information from official sources, and information and insights companies where necessary to ensure we hold accurate and up-to-date registration data.
3.11. Categories of Information
The table below contains more details regarding the categories of personal information we collect and process.

4. How we use your information
4.1. GAMSTOP
We mainly use personal information to verify your identity, register you with GAMSTOP, and provide the GAMSTOP service.
To provide the GAMSTOP service we collect information from you and operators. 
We then use this information to inform operators when one of their customers has self-excluded from online gambling services by registering with GAMSTOP.
When an operator is informed that you have self-excluded by registering with GAMSTOP, that operator should prevent you from accessing any of its online gambling services during the period of your self-exclusion.
If you decide to remove your exclusion after your minimum period has expired, we will inform operators for a further seven-year period that you were previously self-excluded.
4.2. Lawful basis
We must identify a lawful basis for our use of your information. 
An explanation of our reasons for using personal information and the lawful bases we rely on is set out below.
Performance of a contract
If you register for GAMSTOP, we will process your personal information as necessary for the performance of our contract with you under our
Terms of Use
.
This includes verifying your identity, registering you, providing the GAMSTOP service, corresponding with you, and otherwise using and retaining your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
4.3. Consent
GAMSTOP
If you register for GAMSTOP, you will not be able to de-activate your self-exclusion until the end of your selected minimum exclusion period. 
Therefore, we do
not
rely on consent (which may be withdrawn) as our lawful basis to use your personal information to operate GAMSTOP or administer your self-exclusion.
Reminder emails
We rely on your consent to send you reminder emails about your self-exclusion and keeping your registration data up to date.
Onfido
We
do
rely on your consent to enable Onfido to verify your identity via automatic facial recognition technology. 
If you do not consent to the Onfido process, we will provide you with alternative options for verifying your identity.
Research
We also rely on your consent to use your personal information for research purposes. 
In order to improve the GAMSTOP service, we collaborate with selected third party independent researchers.
We will only ever share your personal information with an independent researcher where we have your consent.
The results of the research will be shared with us. You may
withdraw
your consent for your personal information to be used for research purposes at any time.
If you do consent to speak to an independent researcher, we will provide you with updated details about the research where appropriate. 
If you do not provide consent, you will not be able to take part in the research.
4.4. Legitimate Interests
Customers of gambling operators
Any time you attempt to log in or try to register for an account with a Gambling Operator, the operator will send us your personal information. 
We will then use your personal information to check whether or not you are registered with GAMSTOP.
If you are not registered with GAMSTOP, our legal ground to use your personal information is our legitimate interests to provide the GAMSTOP service. 
If you are registered with GAMSTOP, we will use your personal information to perform our contract with you (as above).
Third parties
When we receive or collect personal information relating to other individuals as part of the operation of GAMSTOP, our lawful basis for using this personal information is our legitimate interests.
Our legitimate interest
Our legitimate interests for using personal information are:
Providing and developing the GAMSTOP service
The regulatory obligations of Gambling Operators
The regulatory functions of the Gambling Commission
Helping individuals control their online gambling
Exercise our legal rights, including the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
Your interests
We will not use your personal information on the basis of legitimate interests where your interests, rights or freedoms override those legitimate interests.
4.5. Legal Obligations
We also use personal information to fulfil our legal obligations and when ordered to do so by official authorities.
4.6. Special Category Information
Special category information includes more sensitive types of information such as medical details, biometric identification and religious beliefs. 
As it is more sensitive, we must identify an additional condition to use special category information.
Biometric identification
We use biometric identification for verification purposes. Our additional condition for using biometric identification is your consent.
Other special categories of personal information
We do not routinely collect any other special categories of personal information. 
However, where we do need to use your special category information, we will only do so where:
You provided consent
You manifestly made the relevant information public
The use is necessary for a substantial public interest, based on a specific law
The use is necessary for a legal claim

6. International transfers
Generally, we only store and use your personal information within the UK and European Economic Area (
“EEA”
) countries.
If an operator which you use (or try to use) is located outside the UK or EEA and they submit your personal information to our matching service, 
we will let them know if you are, or were, self-excluded. 
Additionally, some service providers acting on our behalf may transfer personal information to the USA or elsewhere outside the UK or EEA.
In each case, we have in place standard contractual clauses to protect your personal information where we transfer it to operators or service providers outside the UK or EEA.  
You can find out more about these clauses on the Information Commissioner’s Office’s website
here
.
You can request further information about our international transfers and the contractual safeguards we implement using the contact details below.

8. Automated decision making
8.1. Self-Exclusion service
Due to the volume of the data we need to process, GAMSTOP is fully automated.
The consequences of GAMSTOP’s automated processes are that you may be prevented from accessing gambling websites and apps run by operators when you are not self-excluded.
Therefore, our automated processes may have legal or similarly significant effects on you. If you believe that our automated processes have
incorrectly identified you as self-excluded, please contact our
Contact Centre
. 
Our staff will undertake an investigation of any concerns you raise about our automated processes.
Providing us at all times with your most accurate and up-to-date registration data will help improve the accuracy of our automated processes.
8.2. Identity verification
As explained above we also use automated processes to verify your identity. 
The consequences of our automated verification processes are that if your identity is verified you will be provided access 
to the GAMSTOP service where you may be prevented from accessing gambling websites and apps.
If you are not verified, you will not be provided access to the GAMSTOP service and may be able to access online gambling services.
If you think we have failed to verify you correctly, please contact our
Contact Centre
. 
Our staff will undertake a thorough investigation of any concerns you raise about our identity verification processes.
