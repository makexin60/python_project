The data we collect about you
“Personal Data”, or “personal information”, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been irreversibly removed (anonymous data). “Sensitive Personal Data” means special categories of data including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
Sensitive Personal Data
Strictly in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation and national legislation of no lesser standard, we will only collect, use, store and process your Sensitive Personal Data with your consent and strictly to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
Personal Data
In compliance with Health Information and Quality Authority standards for health data, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation and national legislation of no lesser standard, we may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you, which we have grouped together as follows:
identity data (including first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender)
contact data (including billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers)
financial data (including bank account and payment card details)
transaction data (including details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us)
technical data (including internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this Site)
profile data (including your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses)
usage data (including information about how you use our Site, products and services)
marketing and communications data (including your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences)
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your Personal Data but is not considered Personal Data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Site feature.
However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
Where we need to collect Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
How is your Personal Data collected?
We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
direct interactions, where you may give us your Personal Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes Personal Data you provide when you: apply for our products or services; create an account on our Site; subscribe to our service or publications; request marketing to be sent to you; enter a survey; or give us feedback or contact us.
automated technologies or interactions as you interact with our Site, where we will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this Personal Data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies. Please see our cookie policy below for further details.

This data may include: technical data from analytics providers; advertising networks and search information providers; contact, financial and transaction data from providers of technical, payment and delivery services; identity and contact data from data brokers or aggregators; identity and contact data from publicly available sources.
How we use your Personal Data
We will use your Personal Data only when the law otherwise allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Data where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; where we need to comply with a legal obligation.

Marketing
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain Personal Data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us. We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your Personal Data with any third party for marketing purposes.
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the Site and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by contacting us at any time.

Change of purpose
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
International transfers
Whenever we transfer your Personal Data we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least that we only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation; and use certain service providers, and specific contracts which give Personal Data the same protection it has in the EU.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data.
Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Sensitive Personal Data and your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Data retention
We will only retain your data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. On termination of your contract with us, for whatever reason, we will retain your data for a period of 30 days. At the end of the 30 day period your data will be deleted.
We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your Personal Data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting us.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.
In some circumstances we will anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your legal rights
You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your Sensitive Personal Data and Personal Data including the right to: request access to, correction of and erasure of your Sensitive Personal Data and Personal Data; the right to object to the processing of your Sensitive Personal Data and Personal Data; the right to request restriction of processing your Sensitive Personal Data and Personal Data; the right to request transfer of your Sensitive Personal Data and Personal Data; and the right to withdraw consent. If you wish to exercise any of such rights, please contact us.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
On termination of your contract with us, subject to your request in writing and with reasonable notice, we will use all reasonable endeavours to transfer the Sensitive Personal Data and Personal Data that you have entered directly on to the Site. The format of any such data so transferred shall be at our sole discretion.
