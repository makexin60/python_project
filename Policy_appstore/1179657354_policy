What Our creator partners Are Saying
‘’I got into YouTube because I love making videos, learning about science and teaching others. But over the last twelve years the channel has grown so much that there is a lot more to the business these days. I’m excited to partner with Electrify so I can hand off a lot of those things and focus on my core passion of making great videos. Plus, with their additional resources I can be more ambitious with both the quality and quantity of content.’’
Derek Muller - Veritasium
“Electrify has enabled me to continue scaling my channel and brand whilst also being a full-time university student. The biggest challenge I had was limited time. Through my partnership with Electrify I now have a team I can work with and delegate work to. This has accelerated audience growth, revenue growth and unlocked further creative opportunities.”
Anthony G - SpitBrix
“Since partnering with Electrify I have been able to increase production on my channel whilst maintaining a high level of quality. It has allowed me to explore options I couldn't have done by myself, such as expanding my brand onto new platforms.”
Alex McColgan - Astrum
