But we did find this little treasure
Motorola launched the Personal Phone in 1992. Until then the two providers, Vodafone and Cellnet, had the business market covered, but mobile phones were, as yet, still too expensive for consumers.
The phone only had three function keys: 'Power,' 'Send,' and 'Call End.'

Personal information we collect about you
Information we collect about you
The types of information we process about you as part of the Rich Communication Service (RCS) Chat Service are:
To protect you and your device from malicious activity such as spam and viruses, the content of communications will be automatically filtered to try and identify such activity and stop it reaching your device.
Connectivity information such as the numbers you send RCS messages to.
Your location via your IP address (or you can choose to share your GPS location with your friends or businesses via the ‘share location’ feature);
Your device details such as your IMEI number, phone number and device type;
Information on when the MSISDNs used in your message’s conversations support RCS or not. We won’t link that information with your MSISDN, but just a global list of RCS enabled MSISDNs supporting RCS (built from all RCS users)
Message and file transfer traffic data such as the numbers of the sender and recipient, the file type, name and length; and
Content of your messages (such as any files or texts) are stored for up to 30 days in the event that the recipient is unavailable when you first send the message.
We’ll also get information about how you use our products and services, such as:
The level of service that you receive – for example, network or service faults and other events that may affect our network services or other services;
We keep an anonymous list of MSISDNs and date when we sent RCS welcome messages, to avoid sending you the same welcome message each time you register to the service. The info anonymize and is automatically deleted in a maximum of 365 days.
In case of technical issues that may harm your device or the service we may include your MSISDN in an anonymous backlist to prevent the service to be activated for that MSISDN.
When we collect your personal information
We collect your personal information when:
·         You send or receive messages or files; or
Vodacom will process your personal data based on:
The performance of your contract or to enter into the contract  and to take action on your requests. For example, we’ll need to process your network traffic data in order for you to send messages and files.
Vodacom’s legitimate business interests , for example, fraud prevention, maintaining the security of our network and services, direct marketing, and improvement of our services. Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our business interests to make sure they do not override your rights.

How we use your personal information
Provide you with your service
We use your data in order to provide you with the RCS Chat. For example, the device uses your data to check in the server if you have new messages or to send files and messages.
Marketing & profiling
Vodacom does not use RCS Chat to send you marketing messages without your permission, however given that RCS is a communications platform, third parties to whom you have given your permission may send you such communications. If you wish to opt-out of those, you should contact the third party in question (the sender of the message(s)).
You may also choose to start and/or continue conversations with brands and businesses using RCS Chat.  If you do so, then your conversations and interactions may be recorded and analysed by those brands and businesses.  For more information please consult the privacy policy of that brand or business.
Analytics
We also conduct real-time traffic analysis for the purposes of routing and detecting any illegitimate Application To Person (‘A2P’) or Person To Application messages – that’s companies sending you messages and/or trying to obtain messages from you. We do not conduct this analysis on a personal level; all your data is aggregated and the analysis is conducted on that aggregate data.
How we share your personal information
Where applicable, we share information about you with:
Companies in the Vodafone Group;
Partners, suppliers or agents involved in delivering the RCS product. We may share information with brands such as your MSISDN, when you choose to start a chat conversation with them. Any messages sent to brands using our platform will be subject to the brand’s privacy policy which you can find in the brand’s profile settings;
Companies who are engaged to perform services for, or on behalf of, Vodacom Limited, or Vodacom Group;
Credit reference, fraud-prevention or business-scoring agencies, or other credit scoring agencies;
Debt collection agencies or other debt-recovery organisations;
Law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulatory organisations, courts or other public authorities if we have to, or are authorised to by law; or
A third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy any applicable law, or other legal or regulatory requirement.
International data transfers
We predominantly process and store data within the EEA. However, in order to offer some of the RCS discovery features to enable your interaction with brands, data may be transferred to third parties located out of the EEA. In such cases, we will make sure that there is a legal basis for such transfer and that your personal information is adequately protected as required by applicable law, for example, by using standard agreements approved by relevant authorities and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information.
How long we keep your personal information for
Cessation of service
We retain data for only as long as is necessary for you to receive your service. If you choose to stop using RCS Chat, we will delete your data after 30 days.
Message and File Transfers
Message and File Transfers (FT) are stored for up to 30 days in the Store & Forward database if the recipient of your message was not available. This is subsequently deleted after the 30 days are up.
Keeping your personal information secure
We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.
Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren’t secure unless they’ve been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.
We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.
We’ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication. You’re responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.
Our website may provide links to third-party websites. We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites. So make sure you read that company’s privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site.
The same applies to any third-party websites, RCS conversations or content you connect to using our products and services.
If you choose to initiate and continue conversations with brands or businesses through RCS discovery features (messaging search, messaging gallery, concierge bot, deep linking from websites, social networks or apps, clicking on ads within an RCS conversation, entering a short code or a long number to start a conversation), your conversation and interactions may be recorded and analysed by brands or businesses.  For more information, please refer to the brand or business’s privacy policy.
You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.
Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies. You should make sure you’re familiar with these.

Information we collect about you
The types of information we collect about you when you visit and interact with this site are:
Your contact details such as name and email address where you have contacted us through this site; or
If you have agreed to cookies, data such as your site preferences or language settings. We can also use this information in an aggregate manner to understand how our visitors navigate this site so we can make it better.
We may process publicly available data to protect the rights of our employees and customers. This data is collected from sources that are legally accessible to the public. The purpose of processing this data is to ensure the safety and security of our employees and customers. We are committed to handling this data responsibly and in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
When we collect your personal information
We collect your personal information when you:
Browse and interact with the vodafone.com website; or
Use our contact forms to get in touch or register your interest.
Vodafone will process your personal data based on:
Our legitimate business interests, for example, direct marketing and improvement of our services.

Additionally, in some cases you have the right to object to this processing. For more information, visit the Your Rights section of this policy.

How we use your personal information
Maintaining this website and providing you with any services requested through it
For example, when you contact us through this site, we’ll use your information to ensure you get the right information and response.
To personalise this website and track its performance
Because of the way this website operates, we may also use information from your browser or browsing activities to personalize the site or route you to relevant information. For example, we may use web-log information, cookies or web beacons in ways that help us maintain some of your site preferences, send you to the right country-specific information or understand how our visitors navigate the site so we can make it better.
You can choose whether or not to allow cookies or web beacons using your browser preferences. To find out more about cookies and your choices, visit the Cookies section of this statement.
How we share your personal information
Some of the services or information you can request on this site may come from other members of our corporate family. Therefore, we may share your information with other companies within Vodafone Group (for example, your local carrier). The laws of the countries where these companies are based may not be the same as those in the EU, but your information will be treated with the same high standard of care wherever it’s processed within the corporate family.
International data transfer
We may need to transfer your information to other Vodafone Group companies (for example, if the information you request is delivered by them) or service providers in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA consists of countries in the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway: they are considered to have equivalent laws when it comes to data protection and privacy. This kind of data transfer may happen if our servers (i.e. where we store data) or our suppliers and service providers are based outside the EEA, or if you use our services and products while visiting countries outside this area.
If Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we will make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will implement additional technical security and organisational safeguards such as asking the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.
How long we keep your information for
We’ll store your information for as long as we have to by law. If there’s no legal requirement for us to retain the data, we’ll only store it for as long as we need to.
Keeping your personal information secure
We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.

that contain its own cookie policy.
In this cookie policy we explain what cookies are, how we use them and how you can manage them for both our site and other websites you might use.
What are cookies
Cookies usually comprise of unique alphanumeric identifier that sits on your browser. In some cases, we won’t be able to link the information we collect by using a cookie back to you. They can, however, enable us to link that information back to you and your personal information, for example, when you log in, or choose to register for a service, or newsletter. We may also use cookies in order to provide you with personalised adverts based on your browsing behaviour.

How we use cookies
We use cookies to make our website work, or work more efficiently. We also use cookies to track what you've done on the site so we can understand what you like and use or don't like and don't use to provide a more enjoyable, customised service and experience, as well as to help us develop and deliver better content, products and services tailored to our customers' interests and needs.
Our cookies don't hold personal information such as your name. They simply let us find information once you're logged in or help link your browsing information to you and your personal information when you choose to register for a service, white paper or newsletter.
To do this we sometimes use persistent cookies. We take looking after your personal information seriously – we're always monitoring and improving how we protect it.
We've put our cookies into the following categories, to make it easier for you to understand why we need them:
Strictly necessary – these are used to help make our website work efficiently and enable you to use our services and cannot be switched off.
Performance – these are used to analyse the way our website works and how we can improve it for example which pages you visit the most often and if you get any error messages from web pages;
Functionality – these help to enhance your experience by doing things like remembering choices you make and provide a more enhanced, personal features; and
Targeting/advertising – these are used to share some information with third parties who we advertise with, so we know how you've reached our website. We can also use cookies to identify the parts of the website you are interested in. We then use this information to show you adverts and pages we think may also be of interest to you, to tailor how we communicate with you, or to tailor the contents of the communications we send to you. If you prefer, you can opt out of these. Tailoring of content means it includes information reflecting the interest you’ve shown in the content of our web pages, or offers or promotions that we think may interest you, and to improve how we respond to your needs.
Persistent Cookies - We sometimes use persistent cookies as well as 'session-based' cookies. A 'persistent' cookie will remain for a period of time set for that cookie. A 'session-based' cookie is allocated only for the duration of your visit to our website and automatically expires when you close down your browser.
Please also note that some cookies may be set by your browser, for example when you browse using Google Chrome. We don’t control the use of browser cookies, so we suggest you check the browser’s cookie policy to understand how those are used and how you can manage them.

So, when you 'Like' or 'Tweet' an item from our website, these sites may sometimes put cookies on your computer. We don't control how they use their cookies, so we suggest you check their website to see how they're using them and how you can manage them.
Affiliates of the Vodafone Group with a different domain name may also place cookies on our website, to show you adverts or pages of other Vodafone Group companies that may be of interest to you. Details of these affiliates – and how to opt-out – are included in the table.
