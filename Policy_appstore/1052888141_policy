What are National Holidays?
National holidays are special dates designated by a country to commemorate significant historical events, cultural traditions, or important figures. Typically, national holidays are marked by various festivities, parades, ceremonies, and sometimes even time off work or school, allowing people to come together and reflect on their shared history and values.
Serious National Holidays
Examples of serious national holidays can include Independence Day, which celebrates a country's freedom, or Thanksgiving, a time for expressing gratitude and togetherness.
Quirky or unusual National Holidays
Funny national holidays, often referred to as quirky or unusual holidays, provide a delightful break from the ordinary and a reason to celebrate the peculiar aspects of life. These offbeat holidays often involve lighthearted and entertaining themes, adding a touch of humor to our calendars. From National Pi√±ata Day, where we get to release our inner child by swinging at candy-filled papier-m√¢ch√© creations, to National Talk Like a Pirate Day, when people playfully embrace their inner swashbuckler with pirate jargon, these holidays offer a dose of laughter and amusement.
Whether it's celebrating National Rubber Ducky Day by indulging in some bathtub nostalgia or participating in International Goof Off Day to unwind and have fun, funny national holidays remind us to enjoy life's whimsical moments and share a good laugh with others.

I never really write reviews, but I wanted to for this app. I had been using the free version for some time now and absolutely loved it. I loved it so much I actually upgraded for the one time payment to see all of the holidays for a day, and I don‚Äôt regret it at all! Great stuff, and great work by the creators of this app!

Fun app
I really like this app. My granddaughter told me about it and now we send silly texts to each other saying ‚ÄúHappy Peanut Day‚Äù or whatever the day is. I know that is an eye-rolling thing to most people but we have fun! It works for us!

Perfect for traditional or quirky holidays!
I was just looking for a traditional USA holidays calendar for IOS when I stumbled across this fabulous app! This app is full of traditional holidays as well as quirky, funny holidays that are free and additional ones that you can purchase and post on your calendar or share via iMessage or social sight! Super fun and unexpected is all I can say! Kudos to the creative minds that put this montage together! üëç

Excellent option to replace Apple‚Äôs default PC holidays. Choose your own.
It took a couple (fun) hours to go through the holidays list to pick out the traditional ones & quickly add them to Apple‚Äôs Calendar app. (...) Since I have calendar on iCloud, it instantly synced to all the family devices. Just chuckle & smirk past all the ‚Äúnon-traditional‚Äù holidays & counter-protest holidays. This is a very intuitive user interface - kudos to the programmers! They thought of almost everything needed to customize your holiday choice.
