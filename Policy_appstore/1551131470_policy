8. YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW TO EXERCISE THEM
8.1 There are a number of rights that you may be entitled to exercise in relation to us when we process your personal data. Below, you find a summary of what these rights involve and when they may apply. If you want to make a request to exercise your rights, please contact us through this
webform
or mail your request to the address in Section 9 below. You can also reach out to our Data Protection Officer using the contact details listed in Section 9 if you have any additional questions or need further help with exercising your rights.
8.2 We kindly ask you to note that there may be limitations to your rights and that we may have to take steps to be able to fulfil them correctly, e.g. to confirm your identity and to ensure we continue to respect the rights of others.
8.3 Your rights and when they may apply:
Right of access.
You have the right to know whether we process personal data relating to you and to obtain a copy of the personal data we process about you. You also have the right to supplementary information similar to the information in this privacy notice to understand how we are using your data, e.g. why we are processing it, what categories of personal data it concerns and for how long we store it.
Right to rectification.
You have the right to have inaccurate personal data about you corrected and, in some cases, you may even supplement it.
Right to erasure.
You have the right to obtain that we erase personal data relating to you when we no longer have a relevant or valid reason to process or store it, such as when you (or the company you represent) quit your subscription with us and end your relationship with us, or if you object to certain processing carried out by us and we cannot adequately justify continued processing.
Right to portability.
You have the right to reuse your personal data. This means you may have the right to receive it from us or have it directly transmitted to someone else for continued use at your choice, where the personal data has been provided or generated directly by you during the course of your relationship with us, e.g. when using the Services, or (where applicable) during activities carried out based on your consent. Please note however that this excludes information or results we have inferred or created. Neither does the right to portability apply to the extent we only process data manually. Your right to portability will further depend on interoperability, what is technically feasible and whether it will adversely affect the rights of others.
Right to object.
You have the right to object to our continued processing of your personal data. For example, where our processing is carried out with reference to our or someone else’s legitimate interests, your objection may result in an obligation for us to cease the processing unless we are able to sufficiently justify continued processing.
Right to restriction.
Following your request to exercise your rights there may be situations where we must cease our processing activities and restrict them, without erasing your personal data. This might be because you object to such erasure or need the personal data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. There may also be situations where we need to verify e.g. the accuracy of the personal data concerned or where we disagree with each other to the extent we need to assess whether we can still process your personal data in spite of your objection. In such cases, you have the alternative to obtain that we restrict the processing of the personal data concerned which means (i) we will only store it or use in very limited situations (if applicable), such as with your consent or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims and (ii) you will be informed before we lift any such restriction.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
If you are unhappy with how we process your personal data or our practices around privacy and data protection matters otherwise, you have the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority. In Sweden, this is the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (Sw. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten), but each EU member state has their own supervisory authority that you can reach out to at your convenience. Before you lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority, you are of course always welcome to contact us with any concerns or complaints. The easiest way to do so is to reach out via this
webform
or at the address in Section 9 below.
