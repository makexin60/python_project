Privacy Policy
Ramblr (“we”, “us, our”) provides a digital platform that helps people blog their explorations in outdoor with recorded GPS routes, geotagged photos, videos, voice/text notes, and share their outdoor stories with a community of registered hikers, bikers, runners, ramblers, equestrians, travelers, and offroaders. This Privacy Policy applies to the following services operated by Ramblr (collectively, the “Service”):
“www.ramblr.com” and other websites owned and/or operated by Ramblr that contain a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”).
All mobile applications that contain a link to this Privacy Policy (the “Ramblr Apps”).
All services made available by Ramblr through the Site and the Ramblr Apps. This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
When you contact us or interact with our Service we collect information that alone or in combination with other information could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”). The Personal Data collected during these interactions may vary based on what you choose to share with us, but it will generally include:
Account Data: When you sign up, some information is required to create an account on our Service, such as your name, username, email address.
Social Media Data: We support social media signup/login. We also have pages (“Social Media Pages”) on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (each a “Social Media Site”). The companies that provide social media signup/login and/or host our Social Media Pages or Social Media Features may provide us with aggregate information and analytics regarding the use of our Social Media Pages and Social Media Features.
User Generated Content: User-generated content, such as profile pictures, GPS routes, photos, images, videos, voice/text memos, comments, questions, messages, and other content or information that you generate, transmit, or otherwise make available on the Service, as well as associated metadata. Metadata includes information on how, when, where and by whom a piece of content was collected and how that content has been formatted or edited. Metadata also includes information that users can add or can have added to their content, such as keywords, geographical or location information, and other similar data.
Additional Information: To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Service, you may choose to provide us with additional information, such as your date of birth/age, height, weight, gender, profile picture, city of residence, mailing address, community username, statistics on your outdoor activity history and your comments, likes.
Additionally, when you visit, use, interact and register with the Service, we may automatically receive certain information about your visit, use, interactions or registration. For example, we may monitor the number of people that visit our Site or Ramblr Apps, peak hours of visits, which page(s) are visited on our Site or Ramblr Apps, the domains our visitors come from (e.g., google.com, yahoo.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to access and visit our Site (e.g. Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.), broad geographical information, and Site- and Ramblr App-navigation patterns. In particular, the following information is created and automatically logged in our systems:
Log Data: Information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit the Site or Ramblr Apps. Log data includes your IP address (so we understand which country you are connecting from when you visit the Site or Ramblr Apps), browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you interacted with the Site or Ramblr Apps.
Device Data: Includes the name of the device, operating system, and browser you are using. Information collected may depend on the type of device you use and its settings. We may also collect data from your device to estimate a variety of metrics like the time, frequency and duration of, and calories burned during, your activities for the purpose of calculating your Usage and Activity Data (described below).
Usage and Activity Data: We collect information about how you use our Site and Ramblr Apps, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, and the time, frequency and duration of, and moving route / calories burned during your activities.
Geolocation Data: If you have enabled location services for an Ramblr App on your mobile device or on your computer via the Site, we may collect your precise location information based on city, state, zip code, country, latitude and longitude. Ramblr may also derive your approximate location from the IP address of your computer or mobile device. Geolocation data is used for purposes of directing you to nearby trails and parks and offering other relevant content and services.
Advertising ID Data: We collect advertising identifiers only for advertising and user analytics. We never collect any persistent device identifiers (such as SSAID, MAC, IMEI, etc) and we never connect the advertising identifiers to persistent device identifiers.
Cookies Data: We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about the Site traffic and the Site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
If you elect to authenticate to our Service using your account on another service (such as a Facebook, Google, or Apple account), we may receive from the other service information like your external account name as well as other information you may choose to make available to us based on your external account settings, such as contact lists and profile photos (if any). You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service.
HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL DATA?
We use Personal Data to enable your use of our Service, including to create your account, identify and direct you to nearby parks and trails, and give you customer support. This processing is necessary to perform our contract with you. We also use Personal Data as necessary for the following legitimate business interests:
To communicate with you and respond to your inquiries, comments, feedback or questions
To manage our relationship with you, which includes sending administrative information to you relating to our Service and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies, and asking you to leave a review or take a survey.
To analyze how you interact with our Service and provide, maintain and improve the content and functionality of the Service and our customer relationships and experiences, develop our business and inform our marketing strategy.
To enable us to enhance and personalize the experience we offer to our users. For example, information like your height, weight, gender, and age allows us to provide more accurate statistics including calories burned and distance traveled, as well as relevant trail recommendations. When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide essential features of the Service such as navigation assistance, recording an activity, and recommending trails near you.
To administer and protect our business, the Site and Ramblr Apps, prevent fraud, criminal activity, or misuses of our Site or Ramblr Apps, and to ensure the security of our IT systems, architecture and networks (including troubleshooting, testing, system maintenance, support and hosting of data); and
To comply with legal obligations and legal process and to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or other third parties, and enforce our terms and policies.
HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE PERSONAL DATA?
In certain circumstances we may share your Personal Data with third parties without further notice to you, unless required by the law, as set forth below:
Vendors and Service Providers: To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, we may share Personal Data with service providers, including hosting, cloud services and other information technology services providers; email communication software providers and email newsletter providers; database and sales services; customer relationship management, customer engagement, and customer feedback services; payment processors; security services; and analytics services.

For example, other users of the Service or the public may have access to your information if you chose to make your profile or other personal information available to them through the Service, such as when you provide comments, reviews, survey responses, or share other content. This information can be seen, collected and used by others, including being cached, copied, screen captured or stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines), and we are not responsible for any such use of information.
DATA RETENTION
We keep Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer. If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies. To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Select the correct timezone for automatic geotagging.
Why do you need this?
Ramblr offers automatic geotagging (the tagging of your photo to the trackpoint where you took it) for all photos you upload for your trip. We do this by matching the timestamp from your photo with the timestamps of your trackpoints in your track. To use this automatic geotagging feature, your camera must set to the correct local time. Also, you need to select the corresponding timezone and daylight savings option on ramblr when you upload your photos. Please note that some photo editing programs cause timestamps to change. If your photos don’t have correct timestamps for any reason, ignore the timezone setting and proceed to the next step by clicking “Confirm”. To use manual geotagging; click the thumbnail of the photo you want to tag (located in right plane of the screen), drag the photo flag in the map plane, and drop the photo flag on any trackpoint. By geotagging your photos you will be able to see where on your trip you took that great shot.

Definition of Terms
Trackpoint
: A pair of coordinates. It has to be part of a Track.
Trackpoints can be generated by the Track drawing tool and/or by a moving GPS (Ramblr App) as a “breadcrumb trail”.
A Trackpoint generated by a moving GPS (Ramblr App) has a timestamp and 3-dimensional coordinates including elevation.
However, a Trackpoint generated by the Track drawing tool doesn’t have a time stamp.
Track
:  A collection of Trackpoints, listed in the order which they were written. It is usually displayed as a wavy line
(a collection of segmented straight lines that connect two neighboring Trackpoints which were listed in order).
A Track always has a starting Trackpoint and ending Trackpoint since it is written in order.
There can be multiple tracks on a map.
Direction of a Track
: A track always has a direction from the starting Trackpoint to the ending Trackpoint.
Tool Tips
Undo
:A tool to undo your last action.
Move a Trackpoint
: A tool to move an existing Trackpoint to different coordinates. Select a Track by placing your mouse cursor over it (the Track color will be changed to Pink and will show movable Trackpoints.) Then drag the Trackpoint you want to move to any coordinates on the map.
Remove a Trackpoint
: A tool to remove one Trackpoint from a Track. Select a Track by placing your cursor over it (the Track color will be changed to pink).  Then click on a Trackpoint you want to remove.
Remove a Track
: A tool to remove one entire Track. Select a Track by placing your cursor over it (the Track color will be changed to pink).Then click on it to remove the selected Track.
Draw a New Track
: A tool to draw a new Track (or Tracks). Click on the map to place each Trackpoint. To finish drawing the new Track- click the tool icon again after placing the ending Trackpoint. To draw multiple Tracks; do the same process again for each Track you want to draw. This tool also provides a way to extend a previously existing Track from its ending Trackpoint. Select a Track to extend by placing your cursor near its ending Trackpoint (shown as the “end track marker”). The Track color will change to pink. Then click on the map to place Trackpoints in order to extend your track. The first Trackpoint of your extension will be connected to the ending Trackpoint of the existing Track you’ve selected.
Split a Track
: A tool to split a Track into two separated Tracks. Select a Track by placing your cursor over it (the Track color will be changed to pink and will show all Trackpoints). Click on a Trackpoint where you want to make a split. This tool is useful especially when you want to remove part of a Track you have already taken by a moving GPS (Ramblr App).
