Depending on the app store, this may include the app store user's email address or customer number, the time of the download, and an individual device identifier.

Depending on the operating system, permission for access to certain functions and information may be requested during the installation process. The necessary access permissions include notifications, access to photos for the profile picture, and mobile data.
You can revoke or grant these permissions at any time on your device; however, it should be noted that the app can only be used to a limited extent or not at all without the necessary permissions. Depending on the app version, permissions are either requested before or after installation.
