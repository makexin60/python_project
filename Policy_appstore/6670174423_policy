Privacy Policy
Last Edit - 5 Sep 2024
Welcome to the Privacy Policy of SUPgpt, an application developed by Nixes (“Nixes”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) for macOS, iPhone, and iPad. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, manage, and protect your personal information as you use our SUPgpt application (the “App”). By using the App, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.
Collection of Information
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us through the use of our App. The personal information we collect depends on the platform you’re using:
For Mac: Information shared with Paddle, our payment processing partner, for billing purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, billing address, email address, and payment method details.
For iPhone and iPad: Information shared with Apple through the App Store for billing purposes.
Billing Information
For macOS: All billing-related activities are handled by Paddle, and we do not store, save, or have access to your billing details directly. Paddle processes payments on our behalf and is responsible for securely managing your billing information according to their privacy policy and security standards.
For iPhone and iPad: All billing-related activities are handled by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your billing details.
Use of Google Services for Crash Analytics
To improve the overall performance and stability of the App, we use Google services for crash analytics. These services help us understand how the App behaves in real-world conditions, identify crashes, and track app performance issues. The information collected through Google services does not include personal information but may include data such as device state information, device hardware model, operating system version, and the configuration of the App when the issue occurred.
AI Services
The SUPgpt App utilizes various AI services, including but not limited to OpenAI, Claude, Google, and Groq. Users are required to have already agreed to the respective privacy policies of these AI service providers. We do not control how these services collect, use, or share information about you, and we encourage you to review their individual privacy policies for more details.
Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, no internet-based service is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated.
