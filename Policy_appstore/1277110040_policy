Information submitted to MacPaw will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the Republic of Cyprus, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Ukraine. Data stored and processed by MacPaw may sometimes be moved between these zones (in a secure manner). When you use the Product on your computing device, user content you save will be stored locally on that device and synced with our servers. If you post or transfer any information to or through our Site and/or Product, you are agreeing to such information, including Personal Data and user content, being hosted and accessed in the Republic of Cyprus, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Ukraine.

Safeguards
When you give us Personal Data, we take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely.
Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.
Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our Products installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use in connection with our Site and Product.

Data Breaches
All breaches will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours, unless the data was anonymised or encrypted or if it has a particularly high risk.
Breaches of this Privacy Policy by staff, contractors, officers of MacPaw will be dealt with under the MacPaw’s grievance and disciplinary policy and may lead to a disciplinary sanction.
If MacPaw learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.

We may need to update this Privacy Policy to keep pace with changes in our Sites, Products, and Services, our business, and laws applicable to us and you. We will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will notify you of any material changes that impact your rights under this Privacy Policy by email (to your most recently provided email address) or post any other revisions to this Privacy Policy, along with their effective date, in an easy-to-find area of the Sites, so we recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes. Please note that your continued use of MacPaw’s Sites and/or Products after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any changes in this Privacy Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to it, you will need to stop using the Sites and/or Products.
