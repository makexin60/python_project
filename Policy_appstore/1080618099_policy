“I’ve been running the payroll for Aer Arann (Ireland’s 3rd largest airline) over many years using EuroPay Xtra from Ardbrook. Aer Arann has over 300 employees and I have always found EuroPay Xtra capable of handling the many complicated calculations and numerous exceptions you might expect in a commercial Airline operation. At the same time, EuroPay Xtra is extremely flexible and easy to use with no limits on the calculation and reporting options available. EuroPay Xtra just makes my job possible.”
