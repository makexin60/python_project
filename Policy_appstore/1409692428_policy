“Fantastic app and technology. I track my peak expiratory flow morning and night. It shows if I may be at risk of an asthma attack. I love that I can just email my results to my Dr straight from the app.”

“This little device is a big improvement on the dumb devices you are usually given. Firstly it records all the measurements so you can easily see from the app whether the trend is up or down. It is also more accurate. I compared my smart peak flow readings with professional readings from the hospital and they were pretty close whereas the mechanical meter I’d got from the doctors was way out.”

“The app works very smoothly and logs my peakflow very efficiently and easy for me and my asthma nurse and gp to see clearly. I’m very happy with the results I’m getting from using the Smart Peak Flow daily, and have even started recommending it to other friends and family who suffer with asthma too :)”

“Smart Peak Flow measures your peak flow, but also a percentage compared to your last best blow. This comparison is invaluable when trying to work out if your asthma is worsening or not.”

Director of Allergology
“I recommend Smart Peak Flow as regular peak flow readings help me assess my patients. I know whether the medications I prescribe actually work.”
Dr. Tuck-Kay Loke
Clinical Director
“The fact I am able to have access to patients’ recordings at this time of coronavirus is particularly useful as I am not able to have many face to face consultations at the present time.”
