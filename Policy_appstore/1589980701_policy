Recipients or groups of recipients to whom data may be disclosed
Public authorities in connection with an overriding legal regulation, contractors in connection with a partnership in accordance with Art. 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, technical service providers, external partners (for example, consultancies, marketing agencies, law companies) and internal departments of Titel Media GmbH, Zalando Group companies to fulfil the purposes of data processing (for more information please see “Purposes of data collection, data processing and data use”).
Time limits for the deletion of data
Under statutory provisions, a variety of obligations and periods apply with regard to the data retention. We only store personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected the data. Once these retention periods have expired, the corresponding data must be erased as a matter of routine, unless we still need the data until the expiry of the statutory limitation period for evidence purposes for claims under civil law, due to statutory retention obligations or there is another legal basis under data protection law for the continued processing of your data in the specific individual case.
For evidence purposes, we must retain contractual data for three years from the end of the calendar year in which the business relationship with you ends. Any claims become statute-barred at this point at the earliest in accordance with the standard statutory limitation period. Even after this period, we still have to store some of your data for accounting reasons. We are obliged to do so due to the requirements that may arise from the German Commercial Code, the German Fiscal Code, the German Banking Act, the German Money Laundering Act and the German Securities Trading Act. The periods specified therein for the retention of documents are two to ten years.
Transfer of data to third countries
As further detailed in this Privacy Notice, data may be transferred to third countries, i.e., countries whose level of data protection does not correspond to that of the European Union (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area) in connection with certain services.
Insofar as this is the case and the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision or a provider has not been certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Art. 45 GDPR) for these countries, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfers. These include, among others, the Standard Contractual Clauses of the European Union or binding corporate rules. Where this is not possible, we rely on the derogations of Art. 49 GDPR, in particular your explicit consent or necessity of data transfer for performance of the contract or for implementation of the pre-contractual measures. If third country data transfer is foreseen and no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are in place, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g., secret services) may obtain access to the transferred data in order to collect and analyse it, and that enforceability of your data subject rights cannot be guaranteed. When obtaining your consent via the cookie consent banner, you will also be informed about it.
Legal basis for the collection and processing of personal data
We may also process your personal data which is required to fulfil our legal obligations pursuant to Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
Furthermore, we may process your personal data which is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract entered in your interest pursuant Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, for example, when you conduct a purchase in our store or online store. This legal basis also applies to the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
We may also process your personal data which is required to fulfill our legal obligations pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data which is necessary in order to realise our or third party’s legitimate interest, except where such considerations are overridden by the need to protect your interests or fundamental rights, is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
B. Personal data we collect
We collect information for example to fulfil orders in our store, to answer customers’ requests and to provide better services to our users and customers as well as to improve our business. The list of purposes of data collection and data processing are provided in “Purpose of data collection, data processing and data use”. We collect information in following ways:
Information you give us or information provided through a social network
For example, some of our services require you to sign up for a customer account, provide information for a contest or award, or login to an account through a social network. The information we collect includes email, name, phone number, address, and credit card information. Such information is necessary to render the services requested and/or to provide contractual services. Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Unless statutory provisions provide otherwise, the data will be deleted if the purpose ceases to apply, e.g. if the services are performed in full or if you unsubscribe from our services.
When you contact us, either by email, live chat or by using our contact forms, we collect the data you have submitted with your request (including name, email, message content, IP address) and may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6(1)(b), if the request is related to the conclusion or execution of a contract, and otherwise Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Unless statutory provisions govern otherwise, the data will be deleted if the purpose of processing ceases to apply, e.g. if we have fulfilled your request.
When you make a purchase in our online store, we collect personal data required to process your order. Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Please see section IV. below for further details.
We work with social networks including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube to communicate with our customers. We have access to information you directly provide and information through those social networking services based on your privacy settings on those networks when you visit or contact us on our social pages. Please see section V. below for further details. Such information serves to enhance the usability of our services. Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Unless statutory provisions provide otherwise, the data will be deleted if the purpose ceases to apply.
Information we gather from surveys
If you take part in one of our surveys, we store your contact data and the information you provide as part of the survey. We use this data in anonymous form only. It is not possible to draw any conclusions about your person. We publish the results of the survey on our Website or share them with partner companies, e.g. advertising partners or connected websites. For example, we may share information to show trends about the general use of our services.
To receive surveys and to process your personal data for survey purposes, we will ask you for your prior consent. In this case the legal basis for data processing is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent for receiving surveys and for processing survey data at any time.
Information we get from your use of our services
We may collect usage information when you visit different parts of our Website, use our App or use in-store tablets. We may also automatically collect certain technical information such as device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, device type, unique device identifiers, and mobile information if you use a mobile device to access the Website). If this information is necessary to provide our services, the legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR. In other cases, we ask you for your consent and process your information on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. Please see section I. below for details.
Information we collect from your job application
You can apply for open positions with us via our
application management system
Greenhouse provided by Greenhouse Software, Inc. (registered address: 228 Park Avenue S PMP 14744, New York, 10003-1502, USA) or via email to
hr@highsnobiety.com
. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Greenhouse.  Greenhouse may store and process the above-mentioned data outside the European Economic Area (to the USA). Greenhouse Software Inc. has joined the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which is why the transfer in this case is based on the adequacy decision for the USA in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR.
The purpose of the data collection is the selection of applicants for the possible employment relationship establishment. To receive and process your application, we process the following personal data in particular (hereinafter "Application data"):
First and last name;
Email address, telephone number;
Application documents (e.g., references, curriculum vitae);
Date of earliest possible start of job;
Salary expectations.
The legal basis for the processing of your application data is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
We store your personal data upon receipt of your application. If we accept your application and an employment relationship is established, we retain your application data for as long as it is necessary for the employment relationship and to the extent that legal regulations require us to retain it. If your application is rejected, we will store your application data for a maximum of three months after the rejection of your application, unless you give us your consent to store it for a longer period. If you have separately provided us with your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR, we will store your data submitted as part of the application in our talent pool for a further twelve months after the end of the application process in order to identify any further positions that may be of interest to you and, if necessary, to approach you again. After this period, the data will be deleted. You can revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future.
Sometimes we proactively search online for candidates for our open positions and may then receive your personal data from sources such as LinkedIn or XING or other professional networks where you have published your profile. We may then store some of your data (such as name, link to your profile, please adjust accordingly) in our database and contact you to inform you about our open positions. If there are currently no vacancies, we will ask for your consent to store the data in the Talent Pool.
The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR if the data processing is based on our legitimate interest and Art. 6(1)(a) if the data processing is based on your consent.
C. Information We Share
We do not share personal information with companies, outside organisations and individuals unless one of the following circumstances apply:
With your consent
We will share personal information with companies, outside organisations or individuals if we have your consent to do so. We will also seek your additional consent in case purposes of processing change and we will notify you about it.
For external processing
We provide personal information to our affiliates, service providers or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Notice and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. If personal data is transferred to or processed in countries outside the European Union or European Economic Area, we make sure that our contractors guarantee an adequate level of data protection.
For legal reasons
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We will share personal information with companies, outside organisations or individuals if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
In case of a sale or asset transfer
If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information (including personal information collected from you through your use of our services) could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you and ask for your consent where applicable.
In anonymous form for business purposes
We may share anonymous, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners such as businesses which we have a relationship with, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information to show trends about the general use of our services.
D. Information Security
We work hard to protect our users and customers from unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.

I. Your Tracking Consent Management
When visiting our Website, we will ask you for your consent to use certain cookies and similar tracking technologies. You can at any time revoke your consent for either all cookies and similar tracking technologies or for individual ones by clicking the button below. If you have any questions or concerns on this process, please send an email to

.
Edit Consent
We use Usercentrics, a Consent Management Platform provided by Usercentrics GmbH, Rosental 4, 80331 Munich, Germany (“Usercentrics”). The Consent Management Platform allows us to comply with the statutory provision pursuant to Art 7(1)(a) GDPR. Usercentrics allows us to inform the users about specific tags, cookies and other web technologies on our Website and to obtain, manage and document the users’ consent.
Cookies and similar tracking technologies (“Tools”)
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device by the browser. Cookies are not used to run programs or download viruses onto your computer. Similar tracking technologies are in particular web storage (local / session storage), fingerprints, tags or pixels. Most browsers are set by default to accept cookies and similar technologies. However, you can usually adjust your browser settings so that cookies or comparable technologies are rejected or only stored with your prior consent. If you reject cookies or comparable technologies, it is possible that not all of our offers will function properly for you.
Some cookies are automatically deleted when you end your browser session (“session cookies”). Some cookies will remain stored on your device (“persistent cookies”), for example, to recognize you as a returning user, to gather information about the use of our services and our audience or to display information or advertising tailored to your interests on our Website or on other websites. These cookies will be deleted automatically after a certain period of time.
II. Tools we use on our Website
Data processing via the Consent Management Platform
This website uses various services and applications (collectively, "Tools") that are deployed either by Highsnobiety itself or by third parties through the Consent Management Platform ("CMP"). Below, users will be informed about the use of Usercentrics with IAB TCF, the technologies used, the purposes and legal basis, and the tools specifically used by Highsnobiety.
Usercentrics, IAB TCF and TC String
The Usercentrics tool by Usercentrics GmbH, Sendlinger Straße 7, 80331 Munich ("Usercentrics") is used as the CMP for obtaining and managing user consents, revocations and objections. The current version of the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework ("TCF") standard is observed, which specifies conclusive categories of processing purposes and the associated legal bases. In addition, TCF makes it possible to directly forward the decisions made by users in the CMP, such as consents, revocations and objections, to the providers of the technologies in the CMP. The so-called TC string is used for this purpose. This ensures that the current wishes of the users are always observed and followed by the providers. The content of the TC string is described below.
Usercentrics generates a banner that informs users about the data processing on this website and gives them the option to consent to all, some or no data processing through optional tools. This banner appears on the first visit to this website and when users revisit their choice of settings to change them or withdraw or object to consents. The banner will also appear on subsequent visits to this website if the information in the local storage has been deleted or has expired.
The following User Data is transferred to Usercentrics as part of the website visit: consents, revocations and objections, IP address, information about the browser, terminal device and the time of the visit. In addition, Usercentrics stores the following necessary information in local storage and session storage on the terminal device used for documentation purposes:
"uc_settings": storage of the consents, revocations and objections to each purpose category, the version of the CMP, the language and the User ID of Usercentrics;
"uc-tcf": storage of the TC string in machine-readable form for transmission to the providers of the tools under the IAB TCF with information on consents and legitimate interests as well as revocations and objections to individual purpose categories and individual providers;
"us-user-interaction": storage of the interaction with the banner that took place;
"uc-user-country" (session):Storage of the country.
Data processing by Usercentrics is necessary to provide users with the legally required consent management and to comply with documentation obligations. The legal basis for the use of Usercentrics is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c and f GDPR, justified by Highsnobiety’s interest in fulfilling the legal requirements for consent management. Access to and storage of information in the terminal device is absolutely necessary in these cases and takes place on the basis of the implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member states, in Germany in accordance with Section 25 para. 2 TTDSG.

Detailed information about these cookies and other similar tracking technologies used on our Website, including information on the data processed, recipients, retention period and location of processing, can be found under
Edit Consent
, where you can also manage your consent.
In addition, users can control the use of cookies and other similar technologies at the individual browser level by changing your browser settings (mostly found under “Options” or “Settings” in the browser menu). You have the choice of accepting all cookies, being informed about each cookie or refusing all. To manage Flash cookies, please click here. If you choose not to accept cookies and similar technologies on our Website, it is possible that the functionality of our Website may be limited and some services may not be usable.
We use the following types of Tools:
Essential Tools
These Tools are absolutely necessary for the functionality of our Website and the provision of our services. Legal basis for their use is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if Tools are used to enable the ordering process, or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, for example, if Tools are used for fraud prevention. Access to and storage of information in the device is in these cases strictly necessary and takes place on the basis of the implementation laws of the EU member states of the Art. 5 (3) of the ePrivacy Directive, as example in Germany according to § 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG.
Functional Tools
We use these Tools with your prior consent to analyse and improve the use of our Website and services. Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO. Access to and storage of information in the device is then done on the basis of the implementation laws of the EU member states of Art. 5 (3) of the ePrivacy Directive, as example in Germany the § 25 (1) TTDSG.
Marketing Tools
Marketing Tools are used by our advertising partners to serve advertisements based on your interests and usage behaviour. We will only use such Tools with your prior consent. Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. Access to and storage of information in the device is then done on the basis of the implementation laws of the EU member states of Art. 5 (3) of the ePrivacy Directive, as example in Germany the § 25 (1) TTDSG.
3rd Party Media Tools (Emded Content)
We embed content from our profiles in social media and other media content provided by third parties (for example, YouTube, Instagram). These third party providers may use Tools to enable content sharing and measure user preferences. Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR. Access to and storage of information in the device is then done on the basis of the implementation laws of the EU member states of Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive, as for example in Germany the § 25 (1) TTDSG.
You can revoke your consent for Functional, Marketing, Third Party Media Tools and Embed at any time. To do so, open the settings directly via the link
Edit Consent
in the cookie banner of this website. There you can also change the selection of the tools you wish to consent to using, as well as obtain additional information about the cookies and the respective storage periods. Alternatively, you can assert your revocation for certain tools directly with the provider.
III. App
Download and installation of the App
Our App is available on app platforms run by third parties (e.g. Google Play and Apple App Store). Download may therefore require prior registration with the relevant app store. We have no control over the processing of your data in connection with your registration with and use of third-party app stores. Please see the terms of use and privacy notices of the respective app store operator for more details.
When downloading and installing the app, the necessary information is transferred to the respective app store, in particular your name, email address and account number, the time of download, payment information and the individual device identifier.
We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it. We process this provided data only to the extent necessary for downloading and installing the app on your mobile device (e.g. smartphone, tablet). Beyond that, this data is not stored further.
The legal basis for data processing in our area of responsibility is Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR for fulfilling purchase contracts and Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR in cases where Highsnobiety has a legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest is to enable the provision of the app. For data processing, which is the sole responsibility of the app store operator, we refer to their privacy statements:
Apple App Store:
https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT208477
and
https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/de-ww/
.
Our apps can be found at the following addresses in the app stores:
Apple App Store:
https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/highsnobiety/id1589980701
.
Logfiles
Besides the processing of automatically collected usage data according to sections B and D.IX, your mobile device may also automatically create log files on your device, which may contain various information of a technical nature (such as the type of message, date and time of the message, trigger of the message (e.g., an error, an app call), app used, indication of the content of the message). This is necessary for technical reasons so that the app functions properly and you can use the desired services. The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to enable the provision and functions of the app and to ensure the permanent functionality and security of our systems. The storage of and the access to the logfiles is strictly necessary and thus allowed according to the implementation laws of the EU member states of the Art.5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive, as example in Germany according to § 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG.
Sharing App content
If your operating system has an integrated function for sharing app content, you may share content or recommend products, including via social networks. The share functions used by our App are operating system-side functions. We do not receive any information on the recipients and content of your communication. Please see the terms of use and privacy notices of the manufacturer of your device and/or the social networks you use for more details.
System authorizations
In order to enable certain functions, our App must be able to access certain interfaces and data on your device. Depending on your operating system, this may require your express consent. Our App may request the following authorizations.
Requesting mobile data (iOS) or access to all networks and network connections (Android): When using or installing certain apps, these authorizations will be requested in order to allow an app to transfer data via your device’s internet connection (by WLAN or data connection). This authorization may be necessary in order to transfer inputs in the app, e.g. in the course of a search, to our servers.
Changing, deleting or reading the content of USB memory devices/SD cards: These authorizations are required to allow an app to store or read data on your device’s memory or any auxiliary storage. The app will only read the data which was stored in connection with the use of this app.
You can change your authorization settings in your devices’ system settings at any time.
Generally, these app authorizations are necessary to provide our app. Access to and storage of information in the mobile device is strictly necessary in these cases and takes place on the basis of the implementation laws of the EU member states of the Art. 5 (3) of the ePrivacy Directive, as example in Germany according to § 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG. The legal basis for the processing of personal data is then Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interests are to enable the provision and basic functions of the app.
These authorizations are not consent in the meaning of data protection law. Insofar as information is stored or read in the device on the basis of the authorizations granted that is not strictly necessary for the provision of the app, or personal data is processed that cannot be based on our legitimate interests, we will obtain your consent separately. This is then done on the basis of the implementation laws of the EU member states of Art.5 (3) of the ePrivacy Directive, as example in Germany in accordance with § 25 (1) TTDSG, or for the processing of personal data in accordance with Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
Push Notifications
Our App allows you to receive push notifications that will inform you about new content in our App, product availability updates, special offers or new products in the Store. We only send push notifications with your consent. If you activate push notifications, your device will be assigned a device-specific push ID that is technically required for sending such notifications.
Legal basis for such data processing is Art.6 (1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time by deactivating push notifications in your device settings.
You can deactivate push notifications at any time via the settings on your mobile device. You can find instructions on how to do this at the following addresses, for example:
iOS:
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-notification-settings-iph7c3d96bab/ios
IV. User Account
When you create an account in our App, on our Website or in-store using our iPad, we store your email address and a personal password.
If you have an account, you can order in-store or from our online store and save articles and products.
Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if the data is collected in connection with an order (see Sec. VI. below for details), and otherwise our legitimate interest in offering the account functions according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (for example, fraud prevention).
Unless we are required by law to retain your data for a longer period of time (as in the case of data for orders in our store and online store), your data will be deleted at the latest when you delete your account.
In the interest of data minimization, we delete your account if you have been inactive for more than 24 months, i.e. you have not logged in during this period.
V. Online Store
To place an order items from our online or in-store selection, you must create an account using your email address and a personal password.
When placing an order, we collect personal data required to process your order (name, billing address, shipping address, phone number, payment method, email address). These data may be transferred to payment and shipping service providers.
Legal basis for such data processing is Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR. Due to legal regulations, we are obliged to store data for orders, including addresses and payment details, for 10 years.
Payments via PayPal are handled by Braintree, S. à r. l. et Cie, S. C. A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg („Braintree“). If you choose to pay by using Braintree, the information required to process the order (such as customer name, amount to be charged, date/time, bank account details, payment card details, CVC code, post code, country code, address, email address, fax, phone, website, expiry data, shipping details, tax status, unique customer identifier, IP Address, location, and any other data received by PayPal) will be transferred to Braintree. Braintree may forward this data outside the EEA. In this case, Braintree ensures an adequate level of data protection in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Laws. In particular, for transfers of personal data within PayPal related companies, Braintree relies on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent Supervisory Authorities. Other transfers may be based on contractual protections. For payments via Braintree, a fraud check is also carried out.
