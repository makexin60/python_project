Google Tag Manager is a solution that allows us to manage so-called website tags via an interface (and thus, for example, integrate Google marketing services into our online offer). The Tag Manager serves as a "manager" of the implemented tags. This allows us to centrally manage integrated Google products or other analysis tools on our website. The tags embedded on the website are referred to as sections of code that make it possible to track your activities on our website. By using our website, users download the Google Tag Manager, which automatically results in the user's IP address being forwarded to Google With regard to the processing of personal data, please refer to the information on Google services. Data processing for the European Economic Area and Switzerland is carried out by: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
You can access the usage guidelines of the Google Tag Manager here:
