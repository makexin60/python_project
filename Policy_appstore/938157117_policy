When users of the Site wish to negotiate a sale with sellers or make a purchase from a seller they may do so by contacting the seller using a telephone number displayed on the Site which is operated by us. When a user connects with a seller by telephone that call may be recorded by us to log transactions and for training and quality purposes. We may use a carefully selected third party to carry out such call recording, evaluation, and transcription services on our behalf. If a user or seller does not agree to this when notified of this fact by us at the beginning of a call, the call should be terminated. No call recordings are shared with third parties other than as described in this Privacy Policy, and we take steps to eliminate Personal Information from the call recording.
6. Sharing of your Personal Information
1stDibs does not sell, share, trade or give away Personal Information other than as described in this Privacy Policy
, or unless you provide prior consent
.
1stDibs may share Personal Information between the different 1stDibs entities where necessary to provide our services to you. We reveal your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties when you request or authorize it, or to help complete a transaction for you which you have requested.
Where you use our Site to enter into a transaction or correspond with another individual or business registered as a seller on our Site, we provide your Personal Information to that other party in order to facilitate the transaction or the correspondence you have requested. Once your offer is submitted, your Personal Information will be delivered by 1stDibs to that seller, and your order will be placed.
When a US user contacts a seller, 1stDibs may share your search terms, or items you have viewed, saved, or purchased with that seller. You can disable sharing this information with sellers by updating the profile preferences in your account.
Third parties who will have access to your Personal Information include (without limitation) sellers selling items on the Site that you have contacted or made a purchase from, shipping companies, and payment processors completing a transaction at your request.
Sellers from whom you purchase items will have their own privacy practices regarding the information they receive. We encourage you to read such applicable privacy policies. We are not responsible for the processing of your Personal Information by such third parties.
We may share your Personal Information with other companies or agents who have been carefully selected and who perform functions on our behalf (e.g., analyzing data, IT and network services, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, processing orders, shipping or customs agents etc.).
Sharing excludes text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.
We will only transfer your Personal Information to trusted third parties who provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and who can demonstrate a commitment to compliance with those measures.
Where third parties are processing Personal Information on our behalf, they will be required to agree, by contractual means or otherwise, to process the Personal Information in accordance with applicable law.
These companies may then use your information for their own purposes including marketing to you, if you consent to receive notifications relating to their products and services. Where you consent to these companies using your information for their own purposes, their use will be governed by their own privacy policies, which you should review.
We may also disclose your Personal Information to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our User Agreement or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our users or others, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity in connection with our Site, products or services (e.g., sharing Personal Information with a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.).  We reserve the right to release Personal Information to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.
This may also include sharing Personal Information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us, to investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity and to protect the rights or personal safety of 1stDibs employees and third parties (including sellers and buyers).
In the event of a corporate transaction, such as the purchase, sale or other transfer of all or part of our services or assets, we may transfer your Personal Information along with those assets or services to a prospective transferee.  In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, such Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset.  If another company acquires any of our corporate entities, businesses or assets, that acquiring company may acquire your Personal Information.  We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such Personal Information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all of the terms of this Privacy Policy following such transaction.  However, it is our practice to seek reasonable protection for Personal Information in these types of transactions.
7. International transfers
You are advised to be aware that the Personal Information we receive from you and about you may be held on our computers and systems in the European Union and in the computers and systems of our offices and data centers in the United States and may be accessed by or given to our staff working outside the European Union.
Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the United States, where laws regarding data protection may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By using this Site and by providing any Personal Information to the Site, all users, including without limitation users in Canada, the UK and the European Union, acknowledge 1stDibs’ collection and processing of such Personal Information in the United States.
In addition, sellers registered on the Site are located around the world. Due to the nature of our business and to enable us to offer goods and services worldwide, your Personal Information may be transferred to and held by merchants or sellers in any country in the world. By using this Site and by providing any Personal Information to the Site, all users, including without limitation users in Canada, the UK and the European Union, acknowledge the transfer of Personal Information to such third parties.
When disclosing Personal Information from the EU and the UK to a third party (e.g. our shipping agents) located in a country  not recognized by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection (e.g., the United States), we will take appropriate steps to safeguard such Personal Information, such as by implementing the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, this includes where 1stDibs.com, Inc. receives Personal Information in the US from 1stDibs.com Ltd. in the UK.
For the avoidance of doubt, 1stDibs does not rely upon the now invalidated U.S. Department of Commerce Privacy Shield Framework in order to receive EU Personal Information in the U.S.  For further details, please contact us at
privacypolicy@1stDibs.com
.
8. How you can access and amend your Personal Information.
You are required to provide us with accurate and up to date Personal Information. 1stDibs gives you the ability to amend your Personal Information at any time by accessing your account on our Site (by clicking on the “account details” link on the website homepage or the Account icon on the mobile application), modifying the Personal Information on your account page, acknowledging our User Agreement by clicking on the box at the bottom of the page and then clicking on submit.
If you do not want to share search terms, or items you have viewed, saved, or purchased history with sellers you contact, you can update your profile preferences on your account page at any time.
Subject to any legislation which might, from time to time, oblige us to store the Personal Information for a certain period of time, we will respect your wishes to correct inaccurate Personal Information. Otherwise, we will hold your Personal Information for no longer than is necessary in connection with our aims as detailed in this Privacy Policy.
You can ask us whether we are keeping Personal Information about you and you can ask to receive a copy of that Personal Information. Before sending you any Personal Information, we will ask you to provide proof of your identity. If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you any Personal Information. We will respond as quickly as we reasonably can to your requests for details of Personal Information we hold about you.
9. Security.
As a registered user of the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password. Please keep your user ID and password confidential.
If you share your computer, we recommend that you log-out and close your browser window after visiting the Site in order to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information including your credit card information, your offer status and buying history.
You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content at our sole discretion.
We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help us protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on our system. The Site encrypts your credit card number and other Personal Information using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the Personal Information from your PC to our servers.
Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, officers, third-party contractors, and strategic partners of 1stDibs who need the Personal Information in order to perform their duties.
TLS is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the Internet. While no system is 100% secure, we believe that the measures we have implemented minimize the risk of a security breach to an appropriate level given the types of Personal Information involved. Please note that any Personal Information you provide us by email is unencrypted.
Please note that transmission of Personal Information via the internet is not completely secure and although we will endeavor to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Site; any transmission is therefore at your own risk. However, once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
10. Opt- out
If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the future, you can “opt-out” by changing your communication preferences in “My Account” or by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. We will try to complete your request as promptly as possible. You can elect not to receive emails from us either by “unsubscribing” to an email you receive or by contacting us as indicated below. Any changes will affect only future uses of your information.

We also set out in the list of third parties, under each ” Category”, non- exclusive examples of the actual third parties (which may include their assigns and successors) to whom we currently disclose your Account Information or to whom we may consider disclosing your Account Information, together with the purpose of doing so, and the actual information we disclose (except as explicitly stated, these third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information was disclosed).
Disclose necessary information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
Disclose aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in Manchester. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personal information.
Disclose necessary Account Information with unaffiliated third parties (listed here) for their use for the following purposes.
Fraud Prevention and Risk Management: to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk. For example, if you use the Services to buy or sell goods using eBay Inc, or its affiliates (“eBay”), we may disclose Account Information with eBay in order to help protect your accounts from fraudulent activity, alert you if we detect such fraudulent activity on your accounts, or evaluate credit risk.
As part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we also may disclose necessary Account Information with eBay in cases where Hyperwallet has placed a hold or other restriction on your account based on disputes, claims, chargebacks or other scenarios regarding the sale or purchase of goods. Also, as part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we may disclose Account Information with eBay to enable them to operate their programmes for evaluating buyers or sellers.
Customer Service: for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).
Legal Compliance: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.
Service Providers: to enable service providers under contract with us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
15. International Transfers
Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud- based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers.
The third parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own. These countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection. We have taken specific steps, in accordance with data protection laws, to protect your Personal Information, including implementing adequate measures. In particular, for transfers of your EEA Personal Information within PayPal Companies, we rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent Supervisory Authorities (available here). For transfers of Personal Data from the UK, these are based on contractual protections, including the UK Addendum (approved by the Information Commissioner’s Office) to the EU standard contractual clauses, approved by the European Commission. Please contact us for more information about this.
16. California Privacy Notice of Collection
Under the laws of California and certain other US states (i.e., Virginia), we are required to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioural advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. We do not sell or share your Personal Information, including any Sensitive Personal Information. We also do not sell or share and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any Personal Information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect,” “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.
