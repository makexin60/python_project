Speech Central sends to servers only telemetry data (crash analytics and usage analytics) that doesnâ€™t contain any personal identifiable information (it may contain data about the model of your device, version of your operating system, your country and language and similar characteristics). All other data created in the process of using the app is accessible only by the user or not stored at all and Labsii cannot have any insight to it.
Any updates to this privacy policy will be published on this page.
