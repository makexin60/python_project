When more than one bar or trinagle appear you calculate the sum of the respective values:
= 71 mph

How many cm of snow is 1 mm water / precipitation?
One mm of water will give roughly 1 cm of snow. The amount of snow depends of how dense, cold and dry the snow is.
If it snows in colder temperatures than 5-10 degrees below freezing, one mm of water can sometimes give more than 2 cm of snow, while wet and heavy snow around freezing will give a thinner layer of snow.
