When interacting with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, we never use or store any personal information about you available on your profile or account. We also never post or upload anything to a social network without a specific request or action on your part and we only post the exact content that you specify and approve. In most cases, this pertains to an image file of your artwork and some text that you provide to accompany it from within one of our creative apps.
