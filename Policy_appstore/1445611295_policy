To exercise your right to access specific personal information and your data portability right, please fill out this

6.3 Right to Delete Your Account and Personal Information
Certain states provide individuals with data rights. You may have the right under applicable laws, including CCPA, to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) or vendor(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.

Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation or legal order.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

form.
6.4 Right to Opt-Out
Certain states provide individuals with data rights. If you are a resident of any such states and you would like to minimize sharing of your information with third parties for marketing purposes, please fill out this
form.
If you are a California resident and would like to exercise one of your rights, you may also contact us at Privacy Hotline 1-866-I-OPT-OUT (1-866-467-8688) and enter our Service Code 990# and select 1.
If you are 16 years of age or older, you may have the right under certain state laws to direct us not to make your Personal Information available for valuable consideration at any time (the “
right to opt-out
”). We do not make available the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “
right to opt-in
”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in may opt-out at any time.
6.5 Exercising Your Rights
Depending on your state of residence in the U.S., you may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf to access or delete your personal information. To do so, you must: (1) provide that authorized agent written and signed permission to submit such request; and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. Please note, we may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
If you have been designated as an authorized agent to submit a request on behalf of another customer, you must make the appropriate selection when you submit a
form.
.
The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
We will respond to verifiable requests received as required by law. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Depending on your state or country of residence, you may be able to appeal our decision to your request regarding your personal information. To do so, please contact us. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required. If you are a resident of Canada, you may have the right to complain to a privacy commissioner about our decision with respect to your request.
6.6 Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless permitted by the applicable law, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by applicable state law that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
6.7 Online Tracking Choices
Most web browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, some features and services of the Services (particularly those that require sign-in) may not function properly if your Cookies are disabled. Similarly, if you choose to delete session objects from the Services, you may not be able to access or use all or part of the Services or benefit from some or all of the information or features and services offered.
Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“
DNT
”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have the user’s online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about that browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operations, including the Services, do not respond to DNT signals.
7. ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We do not review for accuracy or update your information regularly, but encourage you to access, review and update your Personal Information at any time. To request a copy of your Personal Information and data or for assistance regarding canceling your account, or deleting your Personal Information, please fill out this

Section 6

We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the security of your information that we maintain in connection with your use of the Services. For example, we encrypt all data with secure sockets layer (SSL) or similar technologies when we transmit your data. This, however, does not guarantee that your information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical or managerial safeguards. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, computer, and other devices by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. In the event that any of your Personal Information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you, as appropriate, in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.
8.2 Storage
We or our third party hosting providers store Personal Information in operating environments that are safeguarded against public or unauthorized access and protected from internal access with physical and technical security measures.

5.3 Organizational Transitions

6. YOUR CHOICE AND OPTIONS RELATING TO OUR COLLECTION
You can choose not to provide Personal Information. You may always decline to provide your Personal Information to us. Registering for an account is not required to access some of our online content. If you decide to register, you can choose to provide information that does not reasonably identify you to others by selecting a username that is not related to your actual name. You can also decline to provide any optional information in your account. If you choose not to provide certain Personal Information to us, some of your experiences may be affected (for example, we cannot send you our newsletter if you do not provide your email address).
Below are rights and choices you may have with respect to your Personal Information. Please note that some of the rights may vary depending on your country or state of residence.
6.1 You May Decline Other Requests
We use your Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was collected or where you have consented to our use of such information. If you do not wish to provide information to us or do not wish to consent to the uses described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services, set up an account, or supply the requested information to us.
6.2 Right to Access Specific Information and Data Portability Right
Depending on your state of residence in the U.S., you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. If you are a resident of Canada, you have the right to request access to your personal information, to have your personal information rectified if it is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, and to withdraw your consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information (including or use or sharing of your personal information for marketing or other secondary purposes). These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law.
Under CCPA you have a right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:
- The categories of Personal Information that we have collected about you.
- The categories of sources for the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
- Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or making available that Personal Information.
- The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.
- The specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you (also called a data portability request).
- If we disclosed your Personal Information for a Business Purpose, the Business Purpose for which such Personal Information was disclosed, and the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
To exercise your right to access specific personal information and your data portability right, please fill out this
form.
6.3 Right to Delete Your Account and Personal Information
Certain states provide individuals with data rights. You may have the right under applicable laws, including CCPA, to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) or vendor(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation or legal order.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
To get your personal information deleted from our system at any time, you need to contact our company by filling out and submitting this
form.
6.4 Right to Opt-Out
Certain states provide individuals with data rights. If you are a resident of any such states and you would like to minimize sharing of your information with third parties for marketing purposes, please fill out this
form.
If you are a California resident and would like to exercise one of your rights, you may also contact us at Privacy Hotline 1-866-I-OPT-OUT (1-866-467-8688) and enter our Service Code 990# and select 1.
If you are 16 years of age or older, you may have the right under certain state laws to direct us not to make your Personal Information available for valuable consideration at any time (the “
right to opt-out
”). We do not make available the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “
right to opt-in
”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in may opt-out at any time.
6.5 Exercising Your Rights
Depending on your state of residence in the U.S., you may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf to access or delete your personal information. To do so, you must: (1) provide that authorized agent written and signed permission to submit such request; and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. Please note, we may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
If you have been designated as an authorized agent to submit a request on behalf of another customer, you must make the appropriate selection when you submit a
form.
.
The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
We will respond to verifiable requests received as required by law. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Depending on your state or country of residence, you may be able to appeal our decision to your request regarding your personal information. To do so, please contact us. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required. If you are a resident of Canada, you may have the right to complain to a privacy commissioner about our decision with respect to your request.
6.6 Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless permitted by the applicable law, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by applicable state law that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
6.7 Online Tracking Choices
Most web browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, some features and services of the Services (particularly those that require sign-in) may not function properly if your Cookies are disabled. Similarly, if you choose to delete session objects from the Services, you may not be able to access or use all or part of the Services or benefit from some or all of the information or features and services offered.
Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“
DNT
”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have the user’s online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about that browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operations, including the Services, do not respond to DNT signals.
7. ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We do not review for accuracy or update your information regularly, but encourage you to access, review and update your Personal Information at any time. To request a copy of your Personal Information and data or for assistance regarding canceling your account, or deleting your Personal Information, please fill out this
form.
We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible after verifying your authority to make such requests. Your requests for Personal Information deletion are subject to
Section 6
of this Privacy Policy above and we will delete your Personal Information within a reasonable time.
8. SAFETY AND INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES
8.1 Security
We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the security of your information that we maintain in connection with your use of the Services. For example, we encrypt all data with secure sockets layer (SSL) or similar technologies when we transmit your data. This, however, does not guarantee that your information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical or managerial safeguards. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, computer, and other devices by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. In the event that any of your Personal Information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you, as appropriate, in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.
8.2 Storage
We or our third party hosting providers store Personal Information in operating environments that are safeguarded against public or unauthorized access and protected from internal access with physical and technical security measures. While these measures are helpful to safeguard your Personal Information after we receive it, no transmission of data over the internet is 100% secure.
