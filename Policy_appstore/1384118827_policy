Privacy Policy
Reading Buses General Data Protection policy for website
We are extremely serious about your privacy and safety when visiting the Reading Buses website and using any of our services or products.
This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect about you, when this happens and how it is used. We will always be open and honest about what data we collect and how we use it whenever this happens – and we will never share your data with any third party unless it is for the purposes of fulfilling a contract (e.g. sharing your details with our smartcard supplier to enable you to have a smartcard account) – and your details will never be used for third party marketing unless you give explicit consent.
We will also let you know about the security you can expect whilst browsing our sites as well as when making a purchase from us online.
Children and data protection
Under the new General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), organisations have to be more open about all information usage, especially relating to Children. It is assumed under the regulations that children aged 13 and over are able to give consent as long as the information relating to their data is clear and easy to understand. Children under the age of 13 cannot give consent and this must be given by a parent or guardian. To this end, we will always ask for your date of birth to prove your age – if you are under the age of 13, we will then require another verification from your parent or guardian. This will be indicated on the relevant pages of the website or apps.
Reading Buses email communication
You can sign up for the Reading Buses via the Reading Buses website to receive our monthly eNewsletter which has information, offers and competitions all related to Reading Buses. There are two ways of doing this:
When buying a smartcard (or when logged in to your smartcard account), you can tick the box that asks if you want to receive our email.
You can sign up directly. This function will be available soon.
What information do we collect?
When signing up for our customer email, we currently collect certain information outside the obvious, your email address, to allow us to set up an account for you in our system – this gives you access to your account online so you can change your preferences at any time. This currently includes; Title, name, address, gender, date of birth, a contact number. We also ask that you set up a password.
We are working with our suppliers to ensure that in future, you should only need to give your email address and a preferred name (which will help personalise our customer email for you)
If you sign up to the customer email when buying a smartcard through our online shop, we collect the same information as above as the system is the same.
Who holds my information?
Although your information is entered via the Reading Buses shop website, it is managed by our smartcard system supplier,
Unicard
. Your information will be stored in their system.
Your email address (but no other data), is then exported via an encrypted file into a third-party email system managed by a company called
