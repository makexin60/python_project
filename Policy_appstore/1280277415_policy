Error at level 22
While the target is to use 2 robots you meet on your way, the dash doesn’t update when you succeed, like this there’s no way to reach new levels. Please fix this
Love it
First of all, I’m not a child looking for a game with their favourite cartoon but I love it, it’s extremely addictive. Also, the level 22 error doesn’t exist.(At least not for me or the makers must have fixed it).
