Privacy Policy App
The following privacy policy applies to the use of the app “Looking4Cache Pro” and “Looking4Cache Lite” (hereinafter “App”) of Looking4Cache UG (haftungsbeschrängt) (hereinafter “we” and “our”).
1. General information about data processing
We put great value on data protection. Your personal data is collected and processed in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations, in particular the German “Datenschutzgrundverordnung” (DSGVO). We collect and process your personal data to provide a functional app as well as its contents and services. Your personal data will only be processed with your permission.
2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data
The processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1a of the DSGVO, unless otherwise indicated.
3. Storage time
Unless otherwise indicated, we store personal data on our server until a deletion is ordered by you.
4. Name and address of the controller
The controller in terms of the DSVGO and other national data protection laws of the member states as well as other data protection regulations is:
Looking4Cache UG (haftungsbeschränkt)
Oberer Wasen 12
74626 Bretzfeld
Germany
E-Mail: info@looking4cache.com
5. Data collected by Looking4Cache
5.1. Log files Looking4Cache Server
Every time our server is accessed, this access is logged in log files. This is done when starting the app (checking for news), when downloading maps for offline use (offline vector maps, hillshades), when fetching help content and when saving and loading DNF markers or cache solver variables.
The following data is stored:
called URL
date and time
app and version used
anonymized IP address
The purpose of logging is the traceability of errors and the analysis of the stability of the server. An assignment to your person does not take place. The logs are automatically deleted after 30 days.
This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1f of the DSGVO.
5.2. User-related data on the Looking4Cache Server
Data related to geocaching that cannot be stored on the Geocaching Platform is stored in a database on our server. These are the variables of the Cache Solver.
The following information is transferred and stored:
user ID of the main user
Geocache ID (GC-Code)
variables
date
The purpose of storing this data is to make it accessible when a geocache is downloaded again after it has been deleted from the local database.
5.3. Statistical data / Pro-Test data on the Looking4Cache Server
Our server stores which version of the app was started and, in the case of the „Looking4Cache Lite“ app, whether a test of the functions of the Pro version has already been offered.
The following information is transferred and stored:
pseudonymized user ID of the main user
app version
date
offered / accepted Pro Test
The purpose of saving is to provide the test mode for the functions of „Looking4Cache Pro“ within the „Looking4Cache Lite“ app and to generate statistics on the use of this app (version distribution, number of active users).
It is possible to access the respective data record with the full user ID (e.g. to offer the Pro Test again), but it is not directly possible for us to draw conclusions about the respective user based on the stored data.
In the point of statistics is also our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1f of the DSGVO.
6. Access to device data
Our app uses various data from the iOS device. These accesses are deactivated by default and the authorization for them is not requested until required. All these accesses can be revoked individually in the iOS settings.
6.1. Location
The location is used for displaying your own position on the map, calculating the distance to geocaches and, if necessary, for searching for geocaches via the Geocaching LIVE API.
Your location will not be transferred to us.
Your location is not automatically transferred to third parties, only used locally. A manual transfer to Groundspeak Inc. via the Geocaching LIVE API only happens if you have requested it during a search for geocaches.
6.2. Photos / Camera
Accessing your photos or the camera is done manually through the cache solver (when adding photos) or when creating geocache logs, if you attach a photo to the geocache log.
Photos are not transferred to our server.
When photos are attached to Geocache logs, they are transferred to Groundspeak Inc. via the Geocaching LIVE API.
6.3. Calendar / Contacts
For Event Geocaches you can automatically create calendar entries. This requires access to the calendar. If the calendar is shared with other people, access to the contacts is also required (technically necessary). Calendar entries created from the app can be opened and deleted. The app does not access other calendar entries.
If the profile of a geocacher is opened within the app, it can be called if its geocaching name is entered as a nickname in the contact of the address book. You can also search for geocache log entries for which you have a contact in the address book. To do this, the app searches the address book for contacts with corresponding nicknames. A nickname can also be automatically entered in a contact. This function is optional, the corresponding rights do not have to be granted if this function is not used.
No calendar or contact information is transmitted to our server or to third parties.
7. Third-party vendors
