FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions
1. What is Flexiwage?
Flexiwage is a financial wellness benefit for employees, which enables them to schedule their income in a pay frequency that suits their needs, without impacting a company's ability to process monthly.
2. How does it work?
Flexiwage integrates with your payroll software and works as an add-on via the employee app. The process is simple and works as follows:
Company processes monthly payroll and results are fed to Flexiwage
Flexiwage notifies the employee of how much they have earned in the month
Employee schedules their payments on pre-selected paydates within the app
Flexiwage produces payment file and reports for employer
Employer loads file to bank.
3. If pay frequency is monthly how does it allow me to pay weekly?
As part of implementation, the company selects paydates on which an employee can be paid up to weekly frequency. When the employee receives their notification each month, they can distribute as much of their earned income as they choose on each date.
4. If frequency is currently weekly, how do we move to monthly?
Flexiwage allows an employer to transition to monthly processing , effectively moving the employee into a month in arrears. This is done via an initial bridge loan process to bring an employee up to the monthly cycle. This is then recouped over a period of time, usually 3 months. The employee is not impacted in any way, as during the transition, Flexiwage goes live and they gain more flexibility on the way they are paid.
