Recurrimos a proveedores terceros para ayudarnos a gestionar nuestra actividad, especialmente para el alojamiento de nuestra aplicación, las comunicaciones que podamos tener con usted y el tratamiento de los pagos.

Cuando se transfieren datos personales a un tercero situado fuera del Espacio Económico Europeo (EEE), tomamos las medidas necesarias para garantizar que se continúan protegiendo sus derechos respecto a su vida privada mediante los mecanismos de garantías previstos por el RGPD y de conformidad con las recomendaciones de las autoridades de control, reforzados por medidas contractuales y técnicas.

Medidas de seguridad para impedir la pérdida de sus datos o el acceso no autorizado a estos;
La limitación del acceso a sus datos únicamente a las personas que los necesiten realmente;
El compromiso que nuestro personal, nuestros prestadores de servicios y su personal son conscientes de sus responsabilidades y han firmado cláusulas contractuales adecuadas;
La aplicación de procedimientos que permitan gestionar las posibles violaciones de seguridad de la información, incluyendo los procedimientos para notificarle dichas violaciones cuando estemos obligados a ello;

¿Cuáles son sus derechos?
Tenga en cuenta que, de conformidad con las disposiciones del Reglamento General sobre la Protección de Datos (RGPD), algunos de estos derechos solo se aplican en circunstancias limitadas que le precisamos, si procede.
Accesso
Tiene derecho a acceder a la información que conservamos respecto a este tema.
Esto incluye el derecho a solicitarnos información complementaria relativa a:
Las categorías de datos que tratamos;
Los fines de tratamiento de los datos;
Las categorías de terceros a los que se pueden comunicar los datos;
La duración de conservación de los datos (o los criterios utilizados para determinar dicha duración);
Sus otros derechos relativos a nuestro uso de sus datos.
Tras asegurarnos de que usted es la persona afectada por los datos solicitados o su representante debidamente habilitado, le transmitimos esta información a la mayor brevedad, siempre que no perjudique a los derechos y libertades de cualquier otra persona (por ejemplo, derecho al respeto a la vida privada o los derechos de propiedad intelectual de otra persona).
Rectificación
Tiene derecho a solicitar la corrección de cualquier dato personal inexacto.
En determinadas circunstancias (por ejemplo, cuando los datos personales resultan necesarios en el marco de una investigación penal), no podremos atender su solicitud.
Limitación del tratamiento
Tiene derecho a limitar cómo utilizamos sus datos personales.
Este derecho se pretende aplicar en circunstancias limitadas, por ejemplo, cuando impugna la exactitud de sus datos personales. En dicho caso, puede solicitar la limitación del uso de sus datos en espera de que podamos comprobar la exactitud de sus datos.
Oposición
Tiene derecho a oponerse a que continuemos utilizando sus datos cuando el tratamiento se basa en nuestro interés legítimo.
Para ejercer este derecho, debe proporcionar a Stuart los motivos relacionados con su situación particular que justifique su oposición. Stuart podrá continuar tratando los datos y, por lo tanto, rechazar su solicitud, si existen motivos legítimos e imperiosos para el tratamiento que prevalecen sobre sus intereses y sus derechos, o si los datos resultan necesarios para la constatación, el ejercicio o la defensa de reclamaciones legales.
Portabilidad
Tiene derecho a solicitar la portabilidad de sus datos a otro prestador de servicios cuando la base legal del tratamiento se basa en su consentimiento o en la ejecución de un contrato.
Le entregaremos una copia de sus datos para que pueda proporcionarlos a otro servicio. Si lo solicita y es técnicamente posible, transferiremos directamente los datos a este otro prestador en su nombre. No procederemos a realizar la transferencia cuando esta comporte la difusión de datos pertenecientes a otra persona.
Derecho a la supresión o «al olvido»
Tiene derecho a solicitar su derecho al olvido por parte de Stuart.
Puede solicitar que cancelemos todos sus datos personales que poseemos, siempre y cuando no sea necesario conservarlos en el marco de su uso de los servicios propuestos por Stuart o si retira expresamente su consentimiento (si se trata de la base legal conservada para el tratamiento).
Se aplica el derecho al olvido salvo si se deben conservar los datos con motivo de los requisitos legales o reglamentarios, con fines de seguridad, de prevención de fraudes o con motivo de un problema relacionado con la cuenta como una reclamación o un litigio no resuelto.
Toma de decisiones y elaboración de perfiles automatizados

Recurrimos a proveedores terceros para ayudarnos a gestionar nuestra actividad, especialmente para el alojamiento de nuestra aplicación, las comunicaciones que podamos tener con usted y el tratamiento de los pagos.
En este marco, a veces resulta necesario compartir estos datos con estos proveedores para permitir el correcto funcionamiento de los servicios. Solo compartimos sus datos cuando resulta estrictamente necesario y, de conformidad con las garantías detalladas en esta política de confidencialidad.
Cuando se transfieren datos personales a un tercero situado fuera del Espacio Económico Europeo (EEE), tomamos las medidas necesarias para garantizar que se continúan protegiendo sus derechos respecto a su vida privada mediante los mecanismos de garantías previstos por el RGPD y de conformidad con las recomendaciones de las autoridades de control, reforzados por medidas contractuales y técnicas.
Cuando así lo exige la ley, compartimos los datos personales con las autoridades gubernamentales, incluidas las autoridades fiscales y la policía.

Medidas de seguridad para impedir la pérdida de sus datos o el acceso no autorizado a estos;

El compromiso que nuestro personal, nuestros prestadores de servicios y su personal son conscientes de sus responsabilidades y han firmado cláusulas contractuales adecuadas;
La aplicación de procedimientos que permitan gestionar las posibles violaciones de seguridad de la información, incluyendo los procedimientos para notificarle dichas violaciones cuando estemos obligados a ello;
Si cree que se ha violado la confidencialidad de sus datos, póngase en contacto con nosotros inmediatamente escribiendo a

¿Cuáles son sus derechos?
Tenga en cuenta que, de conformidad con las disposiciones del Reglamento General sobre la Protección de Datos (RGPD), algunos de estos derechos solo se aplican en circunstancias limitadas que le precisamos, si procede.

Esto incluye el derecho a solicitarnos información complementaria relativa a:
Las categorías de datos que tratamos;
Los fines de tratamiento de los datos;
Las categorías de terceros a los que se pueden comunicar los datos;
La duración de conservación de los datos (o los criterios utilizados para determinar dicha duración);
Sus otros derechos relativos a nuestro uso de sus datos.
Tras asegurarnos de que usted es la persona afectada por los datos solicitados o su representante debidamente habilitado, le transmitimos esta información a la mayor brevedad, siempre que no perjudique a los derechos y libertades de cualquier otra persona (por ejemplo, derecho al respeto a la vida privada o los derechos de propiedad intelectual de otra persona).
Rectificación
Tiene derecho a solicitar la corrección de cualquier dato personal inexacto.
En determinadas circunstancias (por ejemplo, cuando los datos personales resultan necesarios en el marco de una investigación penal), no podremos atender su solicitud.
Limitación del tratamiento
Tiene derecho a limitar cómo utilizamos sus datos personales.
Este derecho se pretende aplicar en circunstancias limitadas, por ejemplo, cuando impugna la exactitud de sus datos personales. En dicho caso, puede solicitar la limitación del uso de sus datos en espera de que podamos comprobar la exactitud de sus datos.
Oposición
Tiene derecho a oponerse a que continuemos utilizando sus datos cuando el tratamiento se basa en nuestro interés legítimo.
Para ejercer este derecho, debe proporcionar a Stuart los motivos relacionados con su situación particular que justifique su oposición. Stuart podrá continuar tratando los datos y, por lo tanto, rechazar su solicitud, si existen motivos legítimos e imperiosos para el tratamiento que prevalecen sobre sus intereses y sus derechos, o si los datos resultan necesarios para la constatación, el ejercicio o la defensa de reclamaciones legales.
Portabilidad
Tiene derecho a solicitar la portabilidad de sus datos a otro prestador de servicios cuando la base legal del tratamiento se basa en su consentimiento o en la ejecución de un contrato.
Le entregaremos una copia de sus datos para que pueda proporcionarlos a otro servicio. Si lo solicita y es técnicamente posible, transferiremos directamente los datos a este otro prestador en su nombre. No procederemos a realizar la transferencia cuando esta comporte la difusión de datos pertenecientes a otra persona.
Derecho a la supresión o «al olvido»
Tiene derecho a solicitar su derecho al olvido por parte de Stuart.
Puede solicitar que cancelemos todos sus datos personales que poseemos, siempre y cuando no sea necesario conservarlos en el marco de su uso de los servicios propuestos por Stuart o si retira expresamente su consentimiento (si se trata de la base legal conservada para el tratamiento).
Se aplica el derecho al olvido salvo si se deben conservar los datos con motivo de los requisitos legales o reglamentarios, con fines de seguridad, de prevención de fraudes o con motivo de un problema relacionado con la cuenta como una reclamación o un litigio no resuelto.

Conservaremos estos datos aunque el proceso de incorporación no se complete para mejorar nuestros servicios y evitar cualquier candidatura abusiva o fraudulenta.
Datos biométricos

Esta recopilación de datos nos servirá para asignar entregas, organizar la oferta y la demanda y resolver posibles problemas relacionados con las rutas de entrega. Los clientes también podrán seguir la entrega. Por último, también guardamos un registro de sus entregas, rutas realizadas y contacto con los clientes como parte del seguimiento de las entregas, la prevención del fraude y la gestión de litigios.
También se pueden utilizar sus datos en el marco de la gestión de las reclamaciones de nuestros clientes o de los destinatarios de las mercancías para las necesidades internas de nuestro proceso de mejora de la calidad de nuestros servicios.

C. Core automated processes
Uber uses automated processes to enable certain parts of our services, including functions essential to our business such as matching, pricing and fraud prevention and detection.
Uber relies on automated processes to enable essential parts of our services, including matching (pairing users requesting and providing transportation and/or delivery services), pricing (calculating the amount owed for such services) and fraud detection and prevention. These processes allow Uber to provide a seamless, and safe, experience to millions of users globally every day.
This section describes how automated matching, pricing, and fraud prevention and detection processes work, including how they impact your Uber experience and the personal and non-personal data used to enable these processes.
You may contact Uber
here
if you have questions or concerns regarding these processes.
1. Matching
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms to efficiently match Riders and drivers, or delivery people and Order Recipients. This helps us minimize wait times for you, and enable efficiency for drivers and delivery people.
The matching process is triggered when you request transportation or deliveries through Uber. Our algorithms then evaluate various factors to determine the best match, including your location, requested destination, the proximity and availability of drivers or delivery people, traffic conditions, and historical data (including, in some markets, whether the specific Rider and driver have previously reported having negative experiences with each other).
The trip or delivery request is then communicated to the driver/delivery person matched through this process. Once a trip or order is accepted, we send confirmation of the match to you and the driver/delivery person.
We are constantly refining our matching process to provide the best experience to all users on our platform and may consider different factors depending on the location where you use Uber.
Additional information on Uber’s matching process is available
here
.
2. Pricing
Down Small
When you request transportation or a delivery, Uber uses algorithms to determine the price you pay based on a variety of factors, including:
The type of service you request (for instance, UberX, UberXL, Uber Black)
Your location
Estimated time and distance to destination
Availability and proximity of drivers or delivery people
Time of day
Traffic conditions
Historical data such as traffic patterns and seasonal trends.
Your price may also vary depending on tolls or surcharges incurred, tips, discounts, promotions and subscriptions, and route-based adjustments.
The price may also vary depending on surge pricing, which automatically goes into effect when there are more Riders in a given area than available drivers. This encourages more drivers to serve the busy area over time and shifts Rider demand, to maintain reliability and restore balance.
Additional information on Uber’s pricing process is available
here
.
3. Fraud prevention and detection
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms and machine learning models to prevent and detect fraud against Uber or our users. This includes efforts to monitor for account takeovers, suspicious user behaviors, and unauthorized access attempts, including by third-party aggregators.
These tools look for patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, such as those that vary significantly from typical user behavior. To do this, Uber performs real-time monitoring of information collected from or generated by users, including location data, payment information, and Uber usage. We also examine historical data and compare it against real-time data to help detect suspicious behavior.
Uber may limit your access to its services, or require that you undertake a particular action such as verifying your identity before allowing such access, if it detects potential fraudulent activity.
You may contact Uber customer support
here
if you have questions or concerns about these processes.

Consent
Uber's legitimate interests
Legal obligation
Data protection laws in some countries and areas, including the EEA, UK, Switzerland, Brazil and Nigeria, only allow Uber to use your data when certain circumstances defined under those laws apply.

12. Do we proceed to international transfer of data?
When choosing service providers, Glovo may transfer your data outside the borders of the European Economic Area, for example to the United States. In such cases, Glovo will ensure before sending the data, that such service providers are in
compliance with the standard clauses and minimum security standards
established by the European Commission and that they always process the data in accordance with Glovo’s instructions.
Basis and instructions regarding the international transfer
Glovo may have a contractual relationship with service providers under which they
agree to comply with Glovo’s instructions and put in place the necessary security measures to protect your data.
Where Glovo is compelled to carry out further processing by EU law or the law of the EU Member States to which it is subject,
it shall inform the service provider of such legal requirements prior to the processing
.
Glovo may subsequently
change, supplement or replace
the instructions initially given to the service provider by means of individual instructions and is entitled to issue appropriate instructions at any time. This includes, among other things, instructions regarding the
correction, deletion and prohibition of data.
All instructions issued shall be documented by both Glovo and the service provider.
Requirements directed to service providers
Service providers may only
collect
,
process
or
use data
pursuant to a
master contract and in accordance with Glovo’s instructions.
This applies in particular to the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organizations.
External service providers are required to inform Glovo if they consider that an instruction issued by Glovo, is in contravention of the data protection legislation. Furthermore, service providers are
entitled to suspend
the execution of the instruction concerned until its confirmation or modification by Glovo, and they have a
duty to refuse
to carry out any instructions that are clearly illegal.
13. Do we proceed to automated decision making?
Glovo does not adopt any decision that could affect our
User/ Courier / Job Applicant
significantly based solely on automated processing of their data (e.g. reordering from the stores where our Users have ordered in the past). The only decision-making processes of Glovo are conducted by applying human intervention (e.g. defining the conditions that the User shall meet to be considered for an offer, such as location).
Regarding the existence of automated decisions with legal effects for the Courier, it should be noted that:
Decisions are not made solely on the basis of the automated processing of the personal data of Couriers, but, where appropriate, on the basis of an assessment of the performance of the service.
Consumers or Stores have generated all parameters to be taken into account manually.
All parameters and metrics used to make such decisions always and exclusively refer to the service and the execution of the Terms and Conditions, regardless of the Courier executing it.
Profiles based on the personal data or personal characteristics of the Couriers are not created, as described below.
In no case the attributes of the personality or of the non-professional sphere of the Couriers are taken into account.
The results depend on previous and voluntary actions of the Couriers.
The results may be corrected if there has been an error and/or discrepancy between the Couriers and Glovo.
The Couriers are not prevented from exercising any right.
The Couriers are not prevented from accessing a good or service.
The Couriers are not prevented from entering into a contract.
14. Do we create profiles and/or segment users based on the collected data?
When using the application, Glovo classifies Users based on the
information provided by them about their usage of the application
to adapt it to their needs and to improve it.
The classification is conducted by solely using first party data
. We use information that our Users provide us, such as their historical orders and popularity among new users to suggest similar stores that could be of their interest. This classification is only intended to ensure that our Users find relevant contents, Partners or offers, among others, that may be suitable according to their preferences, and will never have any legal effect on them or the provision of the services by Glovo, the Partners or the Couriers.
Glovo reserves the right to customise the content on its platform and adjust its fees based on various factors and/or information, including but not limited to the number of orders placed by the user prior to the current session, location data, order and delivery data. This process may involve user segmentation based on the data we collect from you, ensuring we can offer you the most personalised and relevant experience possible in our APP.
We remind you that you have the right to not be subject to automated decision making in case you consider that user segmentation may have legal effects to you., by emailing us to gdpr@glovoapp.com
Please, refer to our
T&C
for more information.
15. What security measures have been adopted?
Glovo
has taken the necessary steps
recommended by the European Commission and the competent authority
to maintain the required security level,
according to the nature of the personal data processed and the circumstances of the processing, in order to avoid, to the extent possible and always in accordance with the state of the art, its alteration, loss or unauthorised access or processing. As mentioned above, the personal data supplied
will not be disclosed to third parties without the data subject’s prior authorisation.

17. Glovo Initiatives
GLOVO SOCIAL
What is GLOVO SOCIAL?
GLOVO SOCIAL is a feature of our APP whereby you can add your contacts on your Glovo profile and create your own friends network in the APP. Once your contacts are added, you can share with them, under aggregated or identified basis,  what you are ordering and how you are rating certain items and services offered through the APP.
How can you add your contacts to GLOVO SOCIAL?
First, we will ask you for access to your contacts list of your device. Once you expressly consent to it, your contacts will appear  on your Glovo profile with the name and phone number that are stored in your device.
Then, from those contacts that are incorporated in your Glovo profile from your device, you will be able to add in your Glovo friends list but only  those contacts who are already Glovo users. Hence, in order to protect users’ privacy, you will not be able to add contacts who don’t have a Glovo account.
Last, for adding them in your Glovo friends list successfully, your contacts who are already Glovo users will receive an invitation from your Glovo profile. However, to safeguard your contacts' privacy, you will be unable to know if they have a Glovo account until they accept to be part of your Glovo friends list from their device. Once accepted, they will become part of your Glovo friends list and you can start sharing information with each other.
How do we manage your data?
You always have full control over your Glovo friends list.
You can easily withdraw the consent given to Glovo to access the contacts list of your device at any time by removing the permit given to Glovo for accessing to your contacts list via in your device settings.
Additionally, you can add or remove friends from your Glovo friends list, as well as easily accept or decline invitations from other users’ Glovo users  at any time.
What data do we share?
If you allow us to have access to the contacts list of your device, we will share with you aggregated data about the dishes and partners they rated positively or ordered in the last 12 months only, without identifying them.
In order to see who of your friends have rated a specific dish or partner positively in the last 12 months, you need to ensure that they have become your Glovo friends.
In no instance will Glovo share any information on any other order (such as grocery or shop orders), nor will it share information on the exact number, time or location of the orders made on the platform.
Do we share data with third parties?
We do not share your data with third parties except with those contacts who you accepted to be added in your Glovo account and/or friends you actively accepted to be part of your Glovo friends list. There are no international data transfers involved in this data sharing.
For how long do we share data with your friends? How can you refrain from sharing data with your friends?
We will share your data with your friends while you decide to keep them in your Glovo friend list or you do not revoke our permission to access your contact list on your device. Hence, we will stop sharing your data with your friends (either on an aggregated or identified basis) upon you withdraw the consent given.
How can you exercise your rights?
If you wish to exercise your rights or have any concerns, feel free to contact us through the
form
provided in our privacy policy or emailing us to

Privacy Policy
Last Updated – 13th Aug, 2024
Introduction and Purpose of this Privacy Policy
WizRocket Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its affiliates doing business as CleverTap (“CleverTap,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). CleverTap provides customers (“Customers”) with an online cloud-hosted solution providing them with the ability to analyze how their end users (“Customer End Users”) interact with Customers’ websites or mobile applications and contact Customer End Users via CleverTap’s platform (the “Service”)
CleverTap is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal data. This privacy notice will inform you about CleverTap’s roles in managing personal data, the categories of personal data it collects, their sources, the purposes for using personal data, its practices in disclosing personal data, and how it secures personal data. This notice also tells you about your privacy rights and how to exercise them.
This privacy notice governs, among other things, CleverTap’s privacy practices regarding the clevertap.com website (the “Site”), its relationship with representatives of its business and organizational customers, representatives of other businesses, and candidates for jobs at CleverTap.
Please direct all privacy questions, comments, complaints, or requests to exercise privacy rights to CleverTap’s Data Protection Officer by using the following contact information:
Postal mail or courier: WizRocket Inc., Attention: Angel Indzhov, 607 W Dana St. Suite A Mountain View, CA 94041

Types of Personal Data Received by CleverTap.
CleverTap receives four categories of personal data via its Site, its marketing and business practices:
Personal data collected via CleverTap’s site from site visitors
Personal data collected from representatives of CleverTap’s Customers
Personal data collected from representatives of our vendors, business partners, and other businesses or organizations with which CleverTap has a relationship
Personal data collected from job candidates
Personal data of Customer End Users processed by CleverTap in connection with its operation of the CleverTap Service
CleverTap’s Role as Controller and Processor.
Data protection legislation such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation defines two types of businesses that manage personal data. Data “controllers” determine the purposes and means of processing personal data. Controllers have direct contact with the individuals whose personal data is collected and used. By contrast, data “processors” process personal data on behalf of a controller as a service provider to the controller. Processors do not have direct contact with the individuals whose personal data is collected and used. CleverTap acts as both a data controller and a data processor. However, this privacy notice focuses only CleverTap’s activities as a controller.
CleverTap’s Role as Controller.
When CleverTap manages personal data collected from its site; representatives of its Customers; representatives of vendors, business partners, and other businesses or organizations; and job candidates, CleverTap acts as a controller. As mentioned above, this privacy notice focuses only CleverTap’s role as controller.
CleverTap’s Role as Processor.
When CleverTap processes personal data of Customer End Users via the Service, CleverTap is acting as a processor. As a processor, CleverTap provides its Customers with an online cloud-hosted solution allowing them to analyze how Customer End Users inter act with their websites or mobile applications. CleverTap’s function is limited to providing and managing the Service and the control on the usage, transmission of personal data, is always in accordance with the discretion of a Customer and how a Customer interacts and uses the Service and the agreement between CleverTap and the Customer. However, it is each Customer that has the direct relationship with its Customer End Users. Our Customers would handle all privacy questions, comments, complaints, or requests to exercise privacy rights from Customer End Users under their own privacy policies. If you are an end user of a website or mobile application of one of our Customers, and wish to discuss any privacy matters, please contact the operator of the website or mobile application, not CleverTap.
Customers should be prepared to handle requests for individual rights from Customer End Users regarding personal data about their use of Customers’ websites or mobile applications.
If CleverTap receives a request for individual rights from a Customer End User, CleverTap will use reasonable efforts to identify the applicable Customer and direct the request to that Customer.
Personal Data We Collect, Sources of Personal Data, and Purposes of Use.
Personal Data Collected from Site Visitors
CleverTap collects several types of information from and about users of our site, including information by which you may be personally identified, such as name, company name, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline (“identifiers”). We may also collect from job candidates, in the nature of professional or employment-related information, including education, employment, and employment history.Also, if you use a web form on the Site to communicate with us, we will collect your name, work email, Company name, country, and whatever personal data you include in your message to us. The You are the source of this data. The legal basis for processing this personal data is your consent.
Finally, CleverTap may obtain analytics data in aggregate form or that does not relate or identify an individual. This is not personal data. CleverTap reserves the right to use and disclose this non-personal data without restriction.
Personal Data Collected from CleverTap’s Customers.
Personal Data collected from Representatives of CleverTap’s Customers. CleverTap collects Personal Data from Customer Representatives relating to Customer accounts and management of them. For instance, when Customer Representatives engage in certain activities via the CleverTap Service, including but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or otherwise using or participating in the CleverTap Service (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask Customer Representatives to provide certain information. If they elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask them to provide us with certain Personal Data, such as name, address (including zip code), email address and/or telephone number. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask Customer Representatives to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary. If Customer Representatives do not provide mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity, they will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity with the CleverTap Service.
As Customer Representatives navigate the CleverTap Service, we may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from Customers Representative’s Web browsers (such as browser type and browser language), their Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions they take on the CleverTap Service (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). Through our “import Customer End Users” feature option, a Customer Representative may also provide us with Personal Data about other Customer Representatives such as the name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and/or IP address of the Customer Representatives that you choose to share with us. When you provide us with Personal Data about Customer Representatives that have not provided Personal Data to us, we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided, such as to add new records to your CleverTap account, or as agreed in the applicable agreement with Customer.
We may use Personal Data from Customer Representatives to provide products and/or services to Customers, collect payment for our products and/or services, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the CleverTap Service, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze use of the CleverTap Service, improve the CleverTap Service, and tailor the experience of Customer Representatives in using the CleverTap Service. We may also use Personal Data to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact Customer Representatives, enforce our agreements with Customers, including our Master SaaS Subscription Agreements or Terms of Service, and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. The CleverTap Service may include social media features such as the Facebook “like” button or other associated social media buttons and widgets and such social media features which are hosted by a third party or directly on the CleverTap Service may collect Customer Representatives’ IP addresses and other information. Such interactions are governed by the applicable privacy policy of those social media features.
Customer End User Data.
As part of the provision of the CleverTap Service to Customers, CleverTap collects certain Personal Data and other, Non-Personal Data about Customer End Users as determined by the applicable Customer (“Customer End User Data”). CleverTap does not control or otherwise approve any messages or requests for Customer End User Data made by a Customer to a Customer End User. Customer End Users should be aware that a Customer can request such Customer End User Data from them in order to use the Customer’s website(s) and/or mobile application(s) and that Customer End User Data may then be included in information given to CleverTap through your use of the CleverTap Service. Therefore, Customer End Users should review the privacy policy of a Customer’s website and/or mobile application to assess the security of any information a Customer End User discloses. To the extent that CleverTap does receive any Customer End User Data, CleverTap shall make reasonable efforts, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to maintain the confidentiality of such Customer End User Data. CleverTap has no direct relationship to the Customer End Users whose Customer End User Data it processes and such Customer End User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Customer End User Data should direct his or her query to the applicable Customer for removal. Once such Customer requests removal of such applicable Customer End User Data, CleverTap will respond to such request within one month; provided that (i) such period may be extended by up to 2 additional months when necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests and (ii) CleverTap shall inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
CleverTap’s Customers may electronically submit Customer End User Data to the CleverTap Service. CleverTap will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer End User Data except as provided in CleverTap’s applicable agreement with Customer, or as may be required by applicable law. CleverTap acknowledges that Customer End Users have the right to access their Personal Data. If Personal Data pertaining to a Customer End User has been submitted to us by a Customer, and a Customer End User wishes to exercise any rights it may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such Personal Data, the Customer End User should inquire with the Customer directly. Because CleverTap personnel have limited ability to access data our Customers submit to the CleverTap Service, if a Customer End User wishes to make a request directly to CleverTap, please provide the name of the Customer who submitted your data to the CleverTap Service. We will refer your request to such Customer and will support them as needed in responding to your request within one month; provided that (i) such period may be extended by up to 2 additional months when necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests and (ii) CleverTap shall inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
Personal Data Collected from Representatives of Vendors, Business Partners, and Other Businesses.
We collect Business Card Data from representatives of CleverTap’s vendors, business partners, and other businesses and organizations with which CleverTap has a relationship. We use this personal data to communicate with these businesses and organizations and in order to initiate, maintain, and terminate our relationship with them. Representatives of these businesses and organizations are the source of this information and the legal basis for processing this personal data is the performance of a contract with the applicable business or organization or the legitimate interests of CleverTap or the business or organization.
Personal Data Collected from Job Candidates.
Job candidates can view open positions at CleverTap on the Site and apply for these positions. The portion of the Site for job candidates is managed by
Lever
, an Employ Inc. brand, acting as a service provider to CleverTap. Candidates submit personal data to CleverTap using this portion of the Site, and candidates are the sources of this personal data.
CleverTap collects full name, email address, phone number, resume/CV, LinkedIn profile, expected salary information, notice period, and the candidate’s current location from every job candidate. Optionally, job candidates may submit the name of their current employers, Twitter URL, Github or portfolio URL, other websites, and any other personal data that the candidate provides using the Lever web form, such as a cover letter.
We use personal data collected from job candidates to review, consider, and process their job applications. The legal basis for processing this personal data is the consent of job candidates. If a job candidate withholds or withdraws such consent, we will not be able to consider the job candidate for a CleverTap position.
California resident job candidates: CleverTap has a separate notice of privacy practices covering job candidates who are California residents. California residents should consult the CleverTap Notice of Workplace Privacy Practices for California Candidates and Workers to understand CleverTap’s California privacy practices and their privacy rights.
Cookie Policy.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer or other devices for record-keeping purposes that contains information about you. We use cookies to save you time while using the CleverTap Service, remind us who you are, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect information collected on an aggregate basis that does not identify you, like which pages you visited, what links you clicked on, and how you used the CleverTap Service. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. If you decline cookies, however, you may be unable to use some of the functionality of the Site.
Sharing or Disclosing Personal Data.
CleverTap does not sell the personal data described in this notice in the ordinary course of its business. CleverTap may disclose or share personal data under the circumstances described below.
Authorized Service Providers.
CleverTap provides the Service with the assistance of third parties. These “Service Providers” perform functions on our or your behalf. You or we may share personal data with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, analyze collected personal data, operate the Service, collect payment for the Service, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also share your information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. We require our Service Providers to maintain data protection policies and procedures at least as protective of personal data as the practices described in this privacy notice.
Corporate Transactions.
We may share or transfer personal data about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets of our business, in the event of bankruptcy, or during the negotiations leading to such an event. We will seek assurances from any buyer that your personal data will be used, shared, maintained, and disclosed consistent with the terms of this privacy notice.
Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data.
Exports of Personal Data.
CleverTap may process your personal data in and transfer it to a country other than where you are located. The privacy laws in these other countries may be different from your country of residence and may not offer the level of protection in your own country. We may maintain your personal data in any country in which we have an office or facility or in countries where our Service Providers are located. We will only process personal data and allow Service providers to process personal data in jurisdictions with an adequate level of protection for personal data or use another lawful transfer mechanism to provide an adequate level of protection when exporting personal data covered by this notice.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Compliance.
CleverTap has certified to the U.S. Department of State that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Policy Principles intended as a transfer mechanism to provide an adequate level of protection when exporting personal data to the United States. See
CleverTap’s EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Policy
for details.
Securing Your Personal Data.
We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place industry-standard administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to secure the personal information we collect.
Customer representatives using the Service use authentication credentials or mechanisms to limit access to the Service. We require Customer representatives to protect these credentials or mechanisms by agreement.
Customer End User Data resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information using session encryption initiated by Secure Socket
However, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ industry standard security measures to protect personal data being transmitted and seek to partner with companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the Internet, and we are not responsible for the actions of any third parties involved in the transmission of personal data.
Links to Other Websites.
Our Site may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our Site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such websites and these websites are not governed by this policy. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
Your Rights Regarding Personal Data.
We provide the following rights under this privacy notice, which mirror your rights under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. Your rights described in this section may be limited by applicable law and there may be circumstances under applicable in which CleverTap must or is permitted to limit or deny your request.

Right to Rectification.

Please be aware that applicable law may require or permit CleverTap to preserve some of your personal information as it is presently stored in our systems. Also, Customer representatives may change any of their applicable personal data by logging into their account and accessing the relevant section of the CleverTap Service. We encourage Customer representatives to promptly update their personal data to facilitate continuity of service.
Right of Erasure of Personal Data.
If you wish for CleverTap to delete your personal data, please contact us. Please be aware that applicable law may permit or require CleverTap to retain some of your personal data.

Right to Withdraw Consent.
If we have relied on your consent to process personal data, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us. For instance, CleverTap offers the option to opt out of routine marketing communications from us. Note that even if you opt out of receiving communications from us, we reserve the right to continue communicating with you regarding announcements, administrative messages, and messages regarding account administration relating to the Service that are necessary to our relationship with you and performance of our contract with the applicable Customer.
Exercising Your Rights.
To exercise any of the rights listed in Section 12, please contact us using the contact information.
We may need additional information to act on your request to exercise your rights. For instance, we may ask for information to confirm your identity as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to your personal data.
We will respond to your request within the time limits provided under applicable law. If we deny your request, we will provide the reasons for the denial and the contact information of a CleverTap representative as a point of contact for following up.
We may deny your request if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for instance because you make repetitive requests).
Right to Complain.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Republic of Bulgaria’s Commission for Personal Data Protection, the Bulgarian supervisory authority for data protection issues (https://www.cpdp.bg/en/). We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach the Bulgarian supervisory authority. So please contact us first before lodging a complaint. You may also have the right to submit a complaint to a supervisory authority or regulator in your local jurisdiction.
