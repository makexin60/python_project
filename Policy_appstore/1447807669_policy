When you get a limited license to use Virtual Items, they will reside in your Account until discharged through use of the Service or otherwise surrendered as a result of termination of the Services in accordance with these Terms.

You understand that we may suspend or terminate your Account if for any reason a charge you authorize us to make to your credit card or other method of payment cannot be processed or is returned to us unpaid and, if such event occurs, you shall immediately remit to us payment for such charge through an alternative payment method.
