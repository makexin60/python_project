Description
Explore the radius of locations that matter.
Radius helps you to explore the radius of locations that matter to you.
Maybe:
You are planning a travel aboard for your long-deserved vacation.
You are in charge of open several new retailing stores in a city.
You are buying a new property but hesitate between several possibilities.
You are just wondering about a Tinder match’s possible location. ;-)
…
With Radius Maps, you can:
- Visualize the radius coverage from a location on your maps.
- Combine multiple coverage to make the display more meaningful.
- Manage all the locations that matter to you in one place.
- Automatically project syncing with privacy first policy.
…
We believe that Radius can be especially helpful for those who care about personal privacy, and wish to stay informed while explore.
