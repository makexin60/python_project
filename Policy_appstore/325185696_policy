Turning Sky Live on and off
The camera and microphone on Sky Live can be turned off by pressing the button on top of the Sky Live device. If you do this, no video or audio is captured by Sky Live and the camera and microphone are inoperable.
In addition to this, depending on the service or app you use, you will be able to control the camera and microphone using the controls within the relevant service or app.
Status of Sky Live
When the Sky Live camera and microphone are active, you can tell when video and audio are being captured because the LED light on the front of the device will be white. This will only be happening when you are interacting with Sky Live (e.g. playing a game or making a video call) and if the LED light is not on, the Sky Live camera and microphone are not capturing any video or audio.
Audio and video data leaving Sky Live
The video and audio data captured by the Sky Live device will only leave the device in real time to operate the relevant service you are using at the time (e.g.  making a video call). That data will only be stored or accessed by us off the device if clearly explained to you at the time and you agree to this.
An example of when video might be stored off the device is when you choose to share your photo or video using the Video booth app in which case the photo or video will be stored in the cloud for a short period for you to access it via another device.
Other data we collect
Other than the audio and video data leaving Sky Live and explained above, Telemetry data (as explained above) is collected automatically to enable diagnostics and trouble-shooting.
Subject to you choosing to opt out (details of which can be found under ‘Your choices’), product analytics data (as explained above) is collected automatically to help us improve our content, products, services and customer experiences.
Sky Live captures additional product analytics data due to the unique capabilities of the camera.  This is movement data (in the form of numerical co-ordinates, not actual video) when you move or make gestures or poses in front of the camera. This data is aggregated and anonymised after it is collected and is used to help us improve the performance of the Sky Live camera.
Can Sky Live identify me?
Sky Live does not identify you or anyone else in front of the camera or via the microphone. If we introduce functionality in the future that enables this we will tell you using an appropriate method.

AdSmart is Sky’s tailored TV advertising solution and is used on Sky's and Virgin's TV platforms. AdSmart allows us to show adverts within your TV services (including on Sky+, Sky Q, Sky Glass, Sky Stream and Sky Go) to the people most likely to be interested in the products and services being promoted.
With AdSmart, Sky can show different adverts to different households (in groups of 5,000 or more across Sky and Virgin households) watching the same programme or service. To do this we create a profile about a household comprising factors like interests, age and location using the information you have provided to us, information about your use of our products and services, and information we have acquired from other organisations, and which we may combine with information received from brands wishing to target their advertising to a particular audience. We use this profile information to define groups of audiences to whom we send adverts.
As part of showing these adverts, we also carry out quality and frequency checks, such as whether adverts were displayed correctly and how often particular adverts have been shown.
PromoSmart uses the same process described above to deliver tailored promotions (e.g. for upcoming content) within your TV services.
To the extent any special category data (for example, data concerning health) is processed within AdSmart, Sky relies on your consent for such processing.
If you don’t want your data to be processed for AdSmart & PromoSmart let us know using one of the methods explained under
Your Choices
. You will still see adverts and promotions within your TV services, but they may be less relevant to you.
We also work with Virgin Media to enable AdSmart for their customers on their TV platforms. This works in the same way as AdSmart on Sky as described above. If you do not want to receive tailored advertising (including AdSmart) on Virgin Media's TV platforms, you need to manage your preferences with Virgin Media directly.
More information about how AdSmart can be used by advertisers can be found
here
.
We work with trusted partners to process your personal data to tailor and deliver online and digital advertising, specifically:
Sky’s own advertising on websites, apps and social media platforms, including advertising to promote Sky Protect; and
third-party advertising on websites and apps.
Information we use
We use information such as device IDs, mobile advertising IDs, and IP addresses collected through cookies or similar technologies (which you will separately be asked to accept) on our and third-party websites, apps and devices for online and digital advertising purposes. We may also use information like your name, address, date of birth, phone number and email address, though this will only be in a hashed format (which means that it has been converted into a string of numbers or letters to make it more secure), and our partner will only see that data if it is already used for an account on their site.
How we use this information
This information may be combined with other information we hold about you, including information you have provided to us (such as your date of birth, postcode and your country)  , information about websites you have visited, viewing activity, product holding and information about your use of our products and services, account number and history and Sky iD preferences so we can tailor the adverts you see, show you more relevant content or offers and define groups of audiences to whom we and our partners deliver digital adverts.
What happens if you interact with an advert
If you interact with an advert (such as by clicking a link or scanning a QR code displayed in the advert) we will collect and use the information you provide to enable our partner to fulfil the interaction. For example, if you enter your name, address and payment details to purchase an advertised item, this data will be processed by the fulfilment agency to deliver that item. This information will also be used by us for the purposes described in this section.
We also use aggregated data to better understand advertising performance.
Your online and digital advertising preferences
If you don’t want your data matched with the social media sites you use, let us know using one of the methods explained under
Your Choices
. You might still see Sky posts or adverts on those social media sites, but they won’t be personalised using your Sky account data. You can also change your settings on that social media site to control the promoted posts you see there, and you can find more information on how that social media site uses your personal data in its privacy policy.
Where we use cookies or similar technologies to process your personal data for online and digital advertising purposes, you can set and manage your cookie preferences on the relevant Sky or third-party website or app. After you have made your initial choice, you can change your preferences on Sky websites and apps using the ‘Privacy options’ link in the footer of the site or the settings within the app.
Our partners
We work with our partners to make sure personal data is processed only if appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations and regulatory guidance. Any data transfers outside the UK or EU will only take place on the basis of an approved data transfer mechanism as described in the section ‘How we share your information’.
AdVance is Sky’s online and digital advertising solution which allows us to tailor the digital adverts that you see on Sky and third-party websites and apps based on information we know about you or to reinforce or extend the reach of TV adverts you may have seen (or based on content you may have watched).
To do this, we collect and use the same types of information explained in the ‘Online and digital advertising’ section and combine this with information about your viewing activity so we know what programmes you like and adverts you may have seen.
Subject to your SkyiD and cookie preferences, this may be further combined with device information and information about websites you have visited and other information we hold about you, including information you have provided to us, information about your use of our products and services, and information we obtain from third parties (such as Experian) to define groups of audiences to whom we deliver digital adverts.
If you don’t want your data to be processed for AdVance let us know using one of the methods explained under
Your Choices
.
Where we use cookies or similar technologies to process your personal data as part of AdVance, you can set and manage your cookie preferences on the relevant Sky or third-party website or app. After you have made your initial choice, you can change your preferences on Sky websites and apps using the ‘Privacy options’ link in the footer of the site or the settings within the app.
Sharing with third parties
Sometimes we share information with suppliers and partners to provide our services and for the other purposes described above.  We only share information with these companies where necessary or where we have a legitimate reason to do so and only where we are satisfied that they have appropriate security measures and controls in place to protect your personal data. When these companies act on our behalf, they will only process your personal data in accordance with our instructions and for the reasons set out in this notice.
Some of our suppliers and partners process personal data outside of the UK or EEA (as applicable). We ensure that these companies have measures in place to comply with their obligations under UK or Irish data protection law, and we will only transfer personal data to these companies where we can rely on an approved data transfer mechanism, such as a

in our contracts with these companies. Sky typically relies on the Standard Contractual Clauses available here, together with the ICO’s
data transfer addendum
(where appropriate).
You can see more information below about when and why we share your information with different categories of third party.
Credit reference and crime prevention agencies
Who do we mean  ?
Credit reference agencies (
Experian
,
Equifax
and
CRIF
), other providers who offer affordability and/or credit reference data products, fraud and crime
prevention agencies (
CIFAS
,
GBG Group PLC
(who act as a data controller when processing your data) and
Synetics Solutions Limited
(who act as a joint controller with Sky when processing data)) and other communications providers and banks with whom we have a shared interest in combatting fraud and piracy.
What we do
We share your personal data, such as your contact details, financial data and other information described below:
for use in automated credit decisions;
to help assess whether you are likely to be able to afford the products and services you wish to take from us to help protect your interests and ours;
to assess whether our lending criteria and the decisions we make when providing credit to customers are robust and appropriate;
for the prevention and detection of crimes such as fraud, piracy and
money laundering; and
for identity check and data verification purposes.
When and why we share your data
Credit checks
Where we carry out a credit check with a credit reference agency, the information that we give them (including details of your credit application) and the details of the search itself will be recorded by that credit reference agency. We also exchange information with credit reference agencies on payment performance under your credit agreement on an ongoing basis and this information could be used by us and third parties to make future credit assessment decisions. As part of your credit check, the credit reference agency may also review information in relation to individuals who are financially linked to you.
Fraud prevention
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you.
Fraud prevention agencies may allow the transfer of your personal data outside of the UK. This may be to a country where the UK Government has decided that your data will be protected to UK standards, but if the transfer is to another type of country, then the fraud prevention agencies will ensure your data continues to be protected by ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place. Where appropriate, we may also share your data with other organisations to assist with the prevention and detection of fraud.
Anti-piracy
Where we reasonably suspect that you are pirating Sky or third-party content, we may share information with other organisations with a similar legitimate interest in preventing, detecting and prosecuting piracy.
Data brokers
When and why we share your data
Where a brand or advertiser wishes to target a specific advertising campaign to particular Sky households (for example, using AdSmart), we share your contact details with a data broker (such as Experian) The data broker will match that data against data provided by the brand or advertiser to identify Sky households for that campaign without Sky and the brand or advertiser accessing each other’s customer data.
For example, this data matching process could be performed on behalf of an advertiser that wants to target its television advertising to its existing customers who live near one of its stores.
Separately, the advertiser would receive back a report showing how successful the advertising campaign was (e.g. how many times their adverts were viewed), but would not receive information or data about specific households that have seen their adverts.
Debt collection agencies
When and why we share your data
We will share contact information such as name, address, telephone number and email address with debt collection agencies where there is an outstanding debt owed on the account. We do this so that they can use the information, alongside other information that they hold, to attempt to contact you on our behalf so that we can recover the debt.
In some cases, where we have been unable to recover the amount owed, we may sell the debt to a third-party debt management company. You will be informed when this takes place and following the sale of the debt, any questions you have about communications you receive should be directed to the company in question.
Payment service providers
When and why we share your data
We may share contact details and financial details and any required associated information with our payment service providers to process payments in relation to our services.
This includes Worldpay, who processes some data as a data controller and whose privacy notice can be found

Customer service centres
When and why we share your data
We use third party contact centres, including Firstsource, to provide customer service, sales and support. These companies and their customer service agents can access contact details, account information, product holdings and customer service interaction data to enable them to support you. They may also access any special category data (such as health information) which you have provided to us to help us assist you.
Firstsource’s contact centres in India may process your personal data. Sky relies on Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard this international transfer.
In person sales agents
When and why we share your data
We use third parties, including Salessense International Ltd t/a Uniquely, to sell our products and services in person at your home. These companies and their agents can access contact details, account information, product holdings and customer service interaction data to enable them to discuss your products and services with Sky and offer you further products and services. They may also access any special category data (such as health information) which you have provided to us to help us assist you.

These companies may process your personal data (such as your contact details, account information, product holdings and the information described in the ‘Information we collect automatically’ section above) as part of providing their services to Sky.
Communication providers
When and why we share your data
We share data about you (such as your name, address, email address and device information) with third party communication providers that are necessary for you to enjoy our services, such as broadband and mobile communication providers. This allows us to identify and resolve technical issues impacting the delivery of our services to you so you can continue to receive uninterrupted Sky services. Data shared in this way, is deleted by the third party once the purpose has been fulfilled.
We will also share and receive your information (such as your name, account number, phone number and address) with other communication providers when you choose to switch between us. For example, if you change your broadband provider to Sky, we will share your details with the provider who is losing you as a customer to ensure a smooth transfer of services.
Warranty Companies
When and why we share your data
When you purchase Sky’s products and services, we share your contact information with Domestic & General (Domestic & General Insurance PLC and Domestic & General Services Limited) to enable them to contact you to ensure you are satisfied with your service experience and to let you know about the warranties that apply to your Sky equipment and the options for extended cover.
Loyalty / promotional partners
When and why we share your data
We may share contact and account information with loyalty scheme and other types of promotional partners (such as Nectar), who send information about Sky’s offers, products and services to their customers (where they are permitted to do so) and then report back to us on the performance of such marketing (for example confirmation if you purchased something from Sky based on receiving that marketing).
Marketing companies

Third party app and content providers
When and why we share your data
We share certain personal data with third-party app and content providers (such as Netflix and Disney+) when you choose to pay and/or access those third-party services via Sky (including on Sky Live). We do this to enable and/or verify your ability to access the relevant third-party service via Sky and with certain third-party providers this personal data is held on a joint controller basis (meaning we use and share the data for the joint purpose of ensuring your access to the service).
Third-party app and content providers may also share personal data with us about your use of their apps and services. This is provided to us so we can provide functionality to you within Sky’s services such as resume options for programmes you have started watching elsewhere and personalised recommendations. You should refer to the third-party’s own privacy notice for more details about what information they share and how to manage your preferences.
Other nominated individuals
When and why we share your data
When Sky receives a request for the ownership of a vulnerable customer’s account to be transferred to a nominated individual, the existing account holder’s personal data may be shared with the new account holder. The ownership of the account would only be transferred once Sky has received signed acceptance and authorisation of the transfer from both parties.
Courts, law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulators
When and why we share your data
We share personal data with the courts, law enforcement agencies (e.g. the police) and with regulatory authorities (e.g., Ofcom in the UK) where this is required, in order for us to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

How long we keep your information
In this section, we explain the categories of personal data that we may keep, the periods applied and our reasons for keeping them.
These categories of data include customer contact information, the addresses where we have provided services, account, activation and viewing card numbers, pay per view records, account correspondence with notes and complaints, payment card and financial history. We keep this information for business, legal and regulatory purposes. Some of the legal reasons why we keep this data are: tax purposes, to enable us to defend potential legal claims under the statutory periods set out in the Limitation Act 1980 (for Sky UK Limited and other Sky companies based in England and Wales) or the Statute of Limitations, 1957 (as amended) (For Sky Ireland Limited). We will also need to keep some information to demonstrate compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018, for example, where we need to evidence compliance with suppression requests. This information is also helpful if we receive customer enquiries or complaints, and to verify your identity when you contact Sky.
These records are retained securely for up to 7 years after your account is cancelled.  After this time they will either be securely deleted or anonymised.
Some categories of data are deleted sooner where the data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected (such as where we have recorded calls, these are retained for 24 months). Please read the
Your Rights
page to understand how to get in touch to discuss a right to erasure request.
Please note that you are able to take some actions to delete your data in the My Details page of your Sky account.
