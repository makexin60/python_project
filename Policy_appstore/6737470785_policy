Privacy Policy for Verde VPN
Effective Date: January 9, 2025
Welcome to Verde VPN! Your privacy and legal compliance are our top priorities.
1. Scope of Application
Verde VPN is a comprehensive network protection application specifically engineered for advanced Local Area
            Network (LAN) management. In addition to offering essential VPN services for secure online communication,
            our app is designed to empower users with robust tools for monitoring and managing devices within their
            local networks. These advanced LAN management features enable you to control network access, assign
            permissions, and monitor network status effectively—ensuring that your overall digital environment remains
            secure and well-organized. This Privacy Policy applies to all services provided by Verde VPN that you access
            and use. By clicking "Agree," you consent to the practices described herein. If you do not agree with any
            part of this policy, please refrain from using our services.
2. Information Collection and Use
2.1 Minimal Information Collection
We prioritize your privacy. Verde VPN does not collect, upload, or store any personal information about you.
            Our services are designed to function without accessing or retaining your personal data.
2.2 Permissions Required for Functionality
VPN Permissions:
Necessary to establish a secure virtual private network (VPN) for
                your internet traffic. We do not collect any information transmitted over the VPN.
Network Extension:
Allows Verde VPN to manage network connections without storing or
                accessing your personal information.
2.3 Third-Party Tracking (App Tracking Transparency)
Although our core VPN functionality does not collect your personal information, we may integrate third-party
            services (such as analytics or advertising SDKs) that could track user activity across apps and websites.
In compliance with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requirements, users may be prompted to grant
                or deny permission for such tracking.
If you deny tracking permission, these third-party services are restricted from using your device’s
                Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) or any cross-app tracking methods.
If you allow tracking, certain anonymous or device-level data may be collected by third parties for
                purposes such as aggregated analytics or personalized advertising.
For more information, please review the disclosures in App Store Connect under our “App Privacy”
                details, where we accurately reflect what data is collected and for what purposes.
2.4 Advertisements
We display ads in our app to support our free VPN services. These ads may come from third-party advertising
            networks that collect device information or other data to display relevant ads.
If you grant ATT permission, advertising partners may use your device’s IDFA to provide personalized ads
                or measure ad performance.
If you deny ATT permission, ads will still be displayed, but they may not be personalized based on
                cross-app tracking data.
3. Information Storage
Verde VPN does not collect or store any user data.
            We do not log user activities, store personal information, or require sensitive data.
4. Data Disclosure
We uphold absolute anonymity for our users and:
Do not collect any user data.
Do not share, sell, or disclose any information to third parties (except as noted in Sections 2.3 and
                2.4, if you choose to allow tracking for ads).
Maintain a strict no data retention policy.
5. Information Protection
5.1 Security Measures
Encryption:
We use advanced encryption technologies to protect your data during
                transmission.
Firewalls:
Our servers are protected by robust firewalls to prevent unauthorized
                access.
Access Control:
Only authorized personnel have access to our systems, and they are
                trained to handle data responsibly.
Regular Audits:
We conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate potential
                vulnerabilities.
5.2 Data Security Awareness
Our team undergoes continuous training to stay updated on best practices for information security and privacy
            protection.
5.3 Acknowledgment of Security Risks
While we strive to protect your information, no system is entirely secure. Users should be aware of the
            inherent risks associated with network services.
6. Legal Compliance and Usage Restrictions

Verde VPN is intended solely for legal purposes. Our service is designed to help protect your online privacy
            and manage your network securely.

            of local laws. It is your responsibility to ensure that your use of Verde VPN complies with all applicable
            laws and regulations.
By using Verde VPN, you agree not to engage in any activities that could be interpreted as bypassing legal
            content limitations or geo-restrictions.

            information, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.
