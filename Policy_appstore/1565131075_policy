INTRODUCTION
The Total Football App mobile application software (App) is operated by Topps Europe Limited (Topps, we, our, or us), a subsidiary of The Topps Company Inc.
Topps respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you understand what information we collect about you when you use the App, how we look after your personal data when you use our App and inform you of your privacy rights.
This policy (together with our end-user licence agreements as set out at
https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/
,
https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html
and
https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full
respectively (EULA) and any additional terms of use incorporated by reference into the relevant EULA, together our Terms of Use applies to your use of:
•        The App available on the App Store (for Apple devices) and Google Play Store (for Android devices), once you have downloaded or streamed a copy of the App onto your mobile telephone or handheld device (Device).
•        Any of the services accessible through the App (Services) that are available.
This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
Parents or guardians should explain this policy and the implications of it to any young children using the App. A copy of our Children’s Privacy Policy is available for you to view. Any use of the App by children should be supervised by their parent or guardian.
When downloading and using the App through your mobile platform, the app provider will typically collect certain device and app-related information. Topps does not control the requirements or processes of the app stores; you should review the privacy policy and terms of use of the mobile app stores before downloading or using any app and check your device settings for control options.
This policy is provided in a layered format so you can click through to the specific areas set out below.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WHO WE ARE
Topps Europe Limited is the data controller and is responsible for your personal data.
Contact details
Our full details are:
•        Full name of legal entity: Topps Europe Limited
•        Email address:
totalfootball@topps.com
•        Postal address: 18 Vincent Avenue, Milton Keynes, England, MK8 0AW
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues or other competent supervisory authority of an EU member state if the App is downloaded outside the UK.
Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes
We keep our privacy policy under review.
This version was last updated on August 25th, 2021. It may change and if it does, these changes will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you when you next start the App. The new policy may be displayed on-screen and you may be required to read and accept the changes to continue your use of the App.
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during our relationship with you.
THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
•        When you use the App, we may process anonymised data to see how our users use the App. This data does not identify you as an individual and includes Transaction Data, Device Data, Profile Data, Technical Data and Usage Data. However, in the event that any of these types of data could directly or indirectly identify you, we will treat the data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
•        When you sign-up to the app we may process an anonymised login token received from a sign-in provider such as Google or Apple. This data does not identify you as an individual and is instead a unique numerical ID. We may collect, use, store and transfer (we refer to this as “process” or “processing”) this data that you voluntarily provide in order to satisfy the expectation that you can login across multiple devices. If you trigger a support request that means we need to record this data, it will still be anonymised and only processed in order to satisfy that support request.
•        We also process your anonymised Location Data. You can generally limit or prohibit the collection of Location Data using the built-in settings on your mobile device. Check your device instructions for information on how to do so. We do not collect precise location information from the App.
•        We do process personal data in the form of Transactional Data. We process this personal data, which includes Contact Data such as a physical mailing address to administer the e-commerce transaction that you, the user, has voluntarily triggered and entered personal data in order to receive your order. The purpose for processing this data is to conform to user expectations for this transaction and make sure that the relevant parts of the process have the required information – e.g. Fulfilment Centre gets a delivery address. This data cannot be taken if you are under-18 as you require an active Paypal account to pass on this data. Paypal requires users to be 18 or over to register.
We explain these categories of data below.
We also process Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific App feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?
We will collect and process the following data about you:
•        Information you give us. This is Transactional Data information you give us, through PayPal, when you place an e-commerce transaction, make an in-App purchase, contact us, request to retrieve a lost password, or access the App through different devices and when you report a problem with an App. This applies to any information provided when you use and carry out any activities in connection with our App. If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence.
•        Information we collect about you and your device. Each time you use our App we will automatically collect data including Device Data, Technical Data and Usage Data. You can disable your Location Data in your settings at any time. Such data will be anonymised.
HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We process your personal data for the purposes set forth below. When required by applicable laws, we rely on certain legal bases to process your personal data, depending on how you interact with the Services. Most commonly we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
•        Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
•        Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter or have entered with you.
•        Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
If applicable laws require that we obtain your consent to process your personal data, we will do so at the time of collection.

DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We also share your personal data with the third parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table:
•        Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
•        External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
•        Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
As the Topps family of companies operates globally, we may need to transfer your personal data from our servers in the United Kingdom to other countries, and we may use cloud services whose servers may be anywhere in the world.
In addition, our external third parties may be based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
•        We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
•        Where we transfer personal data to other controllers or processors in other countries, we may use specific contracts approved by the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.
•        Where we use providers based in the United States, we will only process data from users also residing in the United States, affording the same level protection as users in Europe will also experience.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.
DATA SECURITY
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. We do not process any payment transactions from you. All payment transactions will be administered and processed by the respective App Stores under their own terms and/or EULA and Paypal under their agreement. Where you have utilised a third-party login and password that enables you to access certain parts of App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way.
DATA RETENTION
Your anonymised data is retained for as long as you are a user of the App and will not be stored for longer than is necessary. Your Contact data, with Transactional Data, will be retained for as long as the transaction is active. Once the order has been completed, all of your data will generally be deleted from our systems after 3 days and our back-up systems after 14 days.
If your account is inactive, your data will be retained in order to allow you to log into the App to retrieve your account at any point. Our retention practice is as such given users will have purchases tied to their user account and would not expect their account to be closed due to inactivity.
Generally, you may request removal of your account then the account shall be closed immediately and your data will be removed from our live database. All of your data will generally be deleted from our back-up systems after 7 days. You should note that by law, however, we may have to keep certain information about you after you cease being an App user and there may be some exceptions to your right to erasure of your data. Please contact us if you would like further information regarding our data retention practices.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Your legal rights below for further information.
In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
You have the right to access, update and correct inaccuracies in
, or delete,
personal data we collect through the App, subject to certain exceptions.

INTERNAL THIRD PARTIES
Other companies in the Topps family of companies acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the United Kingdom, European Union or the United States and assist with providing the App and Services.
EXTERNAL THIRD PARTIES
•        Service providers acting as processors based in the UK and outside of the EEA who provide the technical expertise to develop the App, to host the App, to provide maintenance and security, to send emails on our behalf, to help us analyse and improve our offers and the user experience and to process any e-commerce transaction that you have entered into.

Such third parties include, without limitation, HM Revenue and Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the UK who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Residents of an EEA member state have the right to:
•        Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
•        Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
•        Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
•        Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
•        Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
(a)  if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;
(b)  where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
(c)  where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
(d)  you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
•        Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
•        Withdraw your consent to processing of your personal data, if we rely on consent as a basis for processing.
DESCRIPTION OF CATEGORIES OF DATA
We will collect certain personal data (data that identifies you directly or indirectly) and anonymous data (e.g. data where your identity has been removed which will not be considered as personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity).

Once scratched off, a code is revealed that can be entered into the Topps Total Football app. This code will deliver a digital parallel of a Total Football's Finest card. A physical copy of this parallel card can then be subsequently printed using the Topps Total Football application functionality at the cost stiuplated within the app.
When does this program begin and end?
The program begins at the official Topps Finest release date of May 15, 2024. The program ends on December 31, 2024 at 11:59GMT. Codes cannot be redeemed after this time, but any claimed cards within the app can be printed until August 31, 2025 at 11:59GMT.
The Program is offered at Topps’ sole discretion. We may, in our discretion, cancel, amend, modify, restrict, and/or terminate these Program Terms and/or the Program, or any aspect or feature of the Program, at any time without prior notice.

What happens if the system says my code is invalid?
Please reach out to our support team via the in-app settings menu or here:
https://total-football.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-topps-total-football/contact-us/
How many times can an unlock code be redeemed?

When do I have to enter my unlock code?
Unlock codes must be received or entered within Topps Total Football no later than the expiration date printed on the unlock card. Expiration dates cannot be extended. Please make sure to review the expiration date on the back of the unlock card.

WHAT CARD CONDITION IS GUARANTEED BY TOPPS?
Any card that is determined to grade an ‘eight’ or better meets Topps standards.
Topps categorise a grade 8 card in line with industry standards. This means that at first glance the card looks to be of high quality, but upon closer inspection there may be a minor print imperfections, slight damage or fraying on one or two of the corners. Centering should be no more that 70/30 difference on the front.
Due to production and handling of the cards, we strive to produce mint or better card(s), but cannot guarantee these conditions. The Topps Company will replace any Topps produced card (from the current year) that is determined to be damaged or defective from production, after being reviewed by our quality control department as not constituting a grade 8 product.
Print finishes, typographical errors and editorial discrepancies are not grounds for a return.
If you choose to print a parallel card, the # will be replaced by a number that shows what version of your card is, such as 1/25, 5/25 and so on. This will not necessarily be the same as the count at the time of your order and not grounds for a return or refund.
Please note that The Topps Company does not pay for shipping when it comes to claims for damaged or defective cards and is not responsible for lost, stolen, damaged, delayed, or, misdirected mail. Replacements for eligible cards will be shipped within 2 to 4 weeks of receipt. Any ineligible cards received (or any cards that Topps is unable to replace, for any reason) will be returned back to the consumer.
WHERE CAN I SEND DAMAGED CARDS FOR REPLACEMENT?
The Topps Company will replace any Topps produced card that is determined to be damaged or defective from any current-year product (only), while supplies last. Topps will send a replacement of similar value (same card not guaranteed).
A request must be accompanied by the following three items:
(1) The damaged card
(2) a letter of explanation
(3) copy of receipt/invoice from point of sale.
Cards can be sent to:
Topps Europe Limited.
Returns Department
PO Box 850
Milton Keynes
MK8 0HU
UK
Topps strongly recommends sending all replacement requests in a fashion which provides proof of delivery, within padded envelopes or boxes.  Please note that The Topps Company does not pay for shipping when it comes to claims for damaged or defective cards and is not responsible for lost, stolen, damaged, delayed, or, misdirected mail. Replacements for eligible cards will be shipped within 2 to 4 weeks of receipt. Any ineligible cards received (or any cards that Topps is unable to replace, for any reason) will be returned back to the consumer.
To be eligible to be submitted for a QC review for a replacement following a purchase, the initial request would need to be submitted within 30 days of purchase. Subsequent reviews of the same order fall under the same timeframe of the initial review and would not be eligible post-30 days to be submitted again.
INTERNATIONAL TAXES
E-commerce orders placed with Total Football from outside the UK may be subject to local import taxes as of 4th January 2021.
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR MY CARDS TO BE SHIPPED?
Once an account holder has placed a delivery request for a card(s) held in their customer typically, within three business days of receipt, the order will be processed and shipped. Once products have been packed and shipped, they should arrive at their destination within 10-15 additional business days.
Please note that once a shipping request is placed, it may not be cancelled, but can be returned at the customer’s expense within 14 days of receipt, should the goods no longer be required and have not been opened. Any refund will be issued, to the payment method used, within 30 days after receipt of the returns.
WHICH COUNTRY'S LAWS APPLY TO ANY DISPUTES?
Consumers should note that these terms, their subject matter and their formation, are governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction except that if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.
