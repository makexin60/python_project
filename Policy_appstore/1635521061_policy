Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information Under The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
