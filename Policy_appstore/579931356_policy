1. INTRODUCTION
Making Fun, Inc. ("Making Fun", "us" or "we") is a publisher and developer of video games for phones, tablets, websites, and personal computers. We offer a website at MakingFun.com, websites for each of our games that are linked from MakingFun.com, and games published on a variety of platforms, by or on behalf of Making Fun, including when they are accessed via the Internet, mobile, PC, or other device (collectively, the "Service").  Making Fun is based in the United States.
As set forth in our
Terms of Service
, which contains the terms for your use of the Service, the Service is intended for general audiences, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under the age of 13 (or under 14 or other age as appropriate based on where you live), please contact us and we will investigate and delete any such data.
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Service ("user", "player", "you", "your"). It describes the collection and use of your personal information on the Service. It also describes generally Making Fun's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and Service usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.
2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON MAKING FUN SERVICES
User Submitted Information
Email Address.
You may choose to submit your email address directly to Making Fun when creating an account with us. We use the email address you submit to provide you with a unique login spanning devices and different third-party platforms as well as to communicate with you.
Additional In-Game Information.
When creating an optional Making Fun account, we require a username and password in addition to email address. Usernames are used to identify the player within the game. It is recommended that the player choose a username that is specific to the game and not something that they use in other applications, such as social media or financial applications. A password is required to secure the account. It is recommended that you choose a strong password that you do not use for any other account. Please note that creating an account and providing your username, email address, and password in our mobile and PC-based games is completely optional. If you do not consent to your personal data being transferred to third parties, which will likely be abroad if you are not in the United States, you can choose not to create an account and forego the advantages of safeguarding your progress and cross-device play.
Public Content
consists of information you disclose in public areas of the Service, such as forums, message boards, chat rooms, gameplay sessions, and other community areas. It also includes the information about you that accompanies this content, such as a username or user picture. Please be aware that Public Content is not private and is available to everyone and may be displayed in search results both on the Service and on external search engines such as Google or Bing. By way of example, gameplay logs containing usernames, timestamps and gameplay data may be made available over the public internet for players to download and analyze for their enjoyment. Please do not use a username that can identify you personally (for example because you use it on other sites that reveal additional information about you) if you have any concerns about this information being freely available. If you have set a user name incorrectly then you may change it via the Service or by contacting us, although it may be impossible for us to eliminate cases of past public usage.
Correspondence
consists of information you disclose when you contact Making Fun, for example, for customer service purposes.
Third-Party Account Information.
When you access our browser-based games through a third-party connection or log-in, such as
Facebook
(the "Channel"), we may collect your user ID, username, country, first and last name, Friend List, and other information relevant to operating our Service that the Channel shares with games on their service, subject to the privacy policy and terms of that Channel.
Making FunÂ Collected Information
Activity Information.
When you access the Service we collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Service, our servers receive and record information about your device, including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Service from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.
On our websites and in our browser-based games, we may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons), which are small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. We may send this data to your browser or device when you first request a remote service and then store the data on your device to access when you make subsequent requests. We use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Service, such as pages you have visited, game sessions you have played, and advertisements you have seen. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the Service.
3. NOTICE & CHOICE
Means of Notice.
This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which Making Fun provides you with notice about its collection and use of your information.
Privacy Policy Changes.
We may modify this Privacy Policy any time at our sole discretion. If we do so, any such changes will be effective immediately upon posting, and we will change the "Updated" date at the top of this document. If we make material changes that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent through email or a prominent posting on the Service (on the website and/or in-game).
Location of Data.
The Service is hosted by
Amazon Web Services
, mostly in the United States, although some elements of the Service are hosted in Europe, Asia and South America to improve the speed of serving users in those areas. If you are located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide immediately encrypted, transferred to, and processed in the United States. U.S. data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. We believe we are in compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), but many aspects of GDPR are up for interpretation and it will take time to understand exactly how GDPR should best be implemented and explained in the context of video games. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care and contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
Linked Websites.
The Service may be linked to sites or services operated by third parties, such as Discord, Google, or Steam. Making Fun is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties. Before you submit information to a third party, leave the Service via a link, or enable a third-party service, you should check the applicable privacy policy of that third-party.
Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Third Party.
We hope that you enjoy our games and occasionally elect to make purchases within them. If you do elect to make a purchase through the Service, you may be required to provide personal financial information, including your credit card information, full name, phone number, billing address, shipping address, or other payment information (collectively, "Personal Financial Information"). At the time of your purchase, Making Fun will notify you of the identity of any independent third-party company that is collecting, transmitting, storing and/or processing your Personal Financial Information. One example of such a third party is
Braintree
, a PayPal service, which processes credit card transactions for games downloaded from our websites.
You acknowledge and agree that this Privacy Policy will not apply to any Personal Financial Information that you provide to any third-party company via the Service and that all payment obligations related to such purchase shall be governed solely by the applicable third-party company's privacy policy. You further acknowledge and agree that Making Fun will have no liability for or control over such third-party company's use or protection of your Personal Financial Information.
You should check the privacy policy of the third-party companyâs website to determine how it will handle any Personal Financial Information it collects from you and/or processes. You acknowledge and agree that in the event that such third-party company experiences a data breach that compromises or otherwise affects your Personal Financial Information, Making Fun shall in no way be responsible or liable to you for such breach. You should contact the applicable third-party company regarding any such data breach.
4. USE AND DISCLOSURE
When we process personal data about you, we do so only as necessary to provide you the Service (i.e. to perform the agreement between us), to meet our legal obligations or to fulfill the so-called "legitimate interests" of Making Fun, or in accordance with the other cases described in this section. To clarify, by legitimate interests we mean lawful purposes that could be reasonably expected, including protecting the security of the data we process, marketing our games, as well as ensuring our marketing is relevant for you, conducting anti-cheat analysis and anti-fraud checks. When we rely on the legitimate interest, we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. For other purposes, we will ask for your consent and you will be entitled to withdraw this consent at any time with no impact on the validity of the processing before your consent has been withdrawn.

We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.
