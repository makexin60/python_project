Privacy Policy
Last updated: May 01, 2021
Data protection and the private sphere of the users are very important to Kollectiv Studio Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Kollectiv Studio”). This privacy policy takes effect on May 01, 2021. It describes what information we hold, why we hold it and how we use it. This policy applies to anyone who uses our App (“Gaelsport/GAH! App”). We’ll refer to the Gaelsport App and GAH! App together as “The App”. In this Privacy Policy, references to the App include both free and paid (Gaelsport Superfan) versions of the App.
Should you be interested in data protection on our website, please read the Data Privacy Policy of the

2. What information do we hold and why?
There are three types of information we process: (1) information you provide, (2) information created when you use features in the App and (3) information from other sources.
2.1 Information you provide
When you use our App, you might provide us with personal information through direct communications
Direct Communications
When you communicate with us (for example when you respond to in-App survey questions, report problems, raise queries etc.) we may receive information about the type of phone you’re using, your service provider and, if you’ve enabled the location permissions in your device, the latitude and longitude of your location when you contact us. We use this information to fix problems in the App, to reply to your communications and to help keep you safe.
Competitions/Promotions solely organised by Kollectiv Studio
The data required for you to participate in the competitions or promotions will be collected and stored by Kollectiv Studio. This data will be used for the following purposes: To execute the contest, to notify prizewinners, and to clarify the shipping address for your prize. Unless otherwise stated, all data collected will be deleted after the conclusion of the contest.
2.2 Information created when you use our App
The following are the types of information created when you use our App. We associate this information with an installation ID number that is randomly generated each time you install the Gaelsport/GAH! App. We use this installation ID to pseudonymise the data we collect from you. We do not access any permanent device ID numbers.
Processing when downloading and installing the apps
In order to be able to download and install our apps from an app store (for example Google Play Store or Apple App Store), you need to register first with the provider of the app store for a user account and finalise a corresponding use contract with the provider of the app store. We have no control over this, in particular we are not party to such a use contract. When downloading and installing the apps, the necessary information in this respect will be transferred to the respective app store, in particular your username, email address and customer number of your account, the time of the download and the individual device number. We have no control over this data collecting and are not responsible for this. We only process this data which has been provided should this be necessary for downloading and installing the app on your mobile end device (e.g. smartphone or tablet).
Location Information
We use the location data described in this “Location Information” section to improve features in the App and for the purposes identified below.
Users of the Gaelsport/GAH! App: if you’ve enabled your device’s location services we may collect and use your start location information when you open the App. If you disable your device’s location services we collect only the start and end points that you search manually.
Device Information
We collect information about the devices you use to access our App, including the type of computer or device you use, the installation ID of the App on your device, the hardware model, operating system and versions, software, file names and versions, the preferred language, time zone settings, and device motion information. This information is necessary for us to diagnose bugs and improve the App. We do not collect any permanent device ID numbers.
Log and Usage Information
Each time you open the App, we collect information about how and when you use it (such as the time and date, searches in the App features and journey results you select, pages visited, app crashes and other system activity). We use this information to improve our App in multiple ways. For example, fixing bugs preventing future crashes and working out which features our users find most helpful.
Cookies
The App uses cookies to store certain information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website or app transfers to your hard drive or mobile device to store and sometimes track information about you. Although they identify a user’s device, cookies do not reveal the name, email address or other obvious identifiers of users.
We try to make your experience of the App simple and meaningful. When you visit our App, our server sends a cookie to your computer or mobile device (depending on how you access the site or App). Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the site. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your App. These are known as “session cookies”. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the App and will last for longer. These are known as “persistent cookies”.
We use cookies to:
remember that you have visited us before, which allows us to identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and to; customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the App; and
collect information about how you use the App so that we can improve the App and learn which parts of the App are most useful.
Some of the cookies used by our App are set by us and some are set by third-party analytics and crash/error-reporting companies as described in this policy.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers. By blocking or deleting cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the App’s features.
2.3 Information from Other Sources

3. How we use your information, summarised.
In summary, we use the information we collect to:
Provide and improve our App.
Build a profile of your preferences so we can personalise the App and provide you with relevant information.
Respond to your emails to discuss your use of the App, Gaelsport
Superfan
and answer any support queries you may have.
Send you marketing communications by email or in-App notifications, and let you know about our policies and terms.
Identify issues with the operation of the App, and provide crash reports in order to find resolution for performance issues.
Improve the design, functionality and/or content of the pages of the App and customise them for you.
Carry out research on users’ choices to improve the App.
Disclose to lawful authorities when required to do so by law, or when appropriate, in our opinion, to respond to their request.
We work hard to improve the App and add functionality, which we think will make it safer, more fun and more useful. New functionality may involve similar or incidental uses of your data to those set out above. We regularly review the way we use data and will update our privacy policy if anything changes.
4. Disclosure of personal data
In principle Kollectiv Studio does not pass your personal data on to third parties. The data collected by us is only passed on to third parties, if this is necessary to provide the technical functionality of the apps or another legal basis for the disclosure of data exists. Personal data may only be used by our service providers in order to fulfil their tasks. These were carefully selected by us and engaged in writing. They are subject to our instructions and are regularly monitored by us. Other use of the information is not permitted and is not carried out by any of the service providers used by us.
Alongside the service providers listed separately in this data privacy policy, data may be disclosed to individual categories of recipients, i.e. to companies in order to support promotions and special campaigns, as well as to external advisors and enforcement authorities.
5. Storage of personal data
Kollectiv Studio Limited is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. We have validated that all 3rd party vendors that we use internally are GDPR compliant.
Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.
6. Permissions
For certain functions, the apps need to be able to access certain services and data of your device. Depending on which mobile operating system you use, this may require you to express agreement to the accessing. Below, we will explain to you – in separate terms according to the mobile operating systems for which we offer the app – what authorisations the apps requests and what these are necessary for.
iOS
Push notifications: Should you click OK in the request “Enable push notifications” , you are permitting the apps to inform you of certain events and topics by means of push notification, even if the apps are not currently open. The notifications can take place by means of sounds, reports and/or symbol letter (a picture of a number on the app icon). Further information concerning push notifications and your configuration options can be found under number 6a).
Background updating: This function enables the apps to download data in the background and to update this, even if the apps are not currently open or are not being actively used.
Mobile data: This function enables the apps to download and update data outside of a WLAN network via mobile data connections (for example GSM, UMTS or LTE).
Android
Apart from the standard entitlements for the operation of Android apps (such as the receipt of internet access or the option of letting the device vibrate; also called “normal entitlements” by Google), we do not request any further entitlements.
Using data which is saved on an external storage device: This function allows the app to save content on the storage card of your device. This is necessary in order to be able to provide content, for example relating to your favourite team, even if no Internet connection is currently present. For this purpose, the apps only use their own saved content. Other data on the storage card is neither deleted, altered or read.
7. Analysis
In order to improve our apps, we use various technologies to analyse the usage behaviour and to evaluate the associated data. These procedures take place anonymously or on the basis of pseudonyms, however never in a directly personal way. Below, we wish to explain these technologies and the providers used for this purpose in more detail. For this purpose, we use so-called number pixels with which we create statistics.
The legal basis is Article 6 Paragraph 1 f) GDPR, based on the legitimate interest of Kollectiv Studio in improving our products.
We use different Firebase Services, including Cloud Messaging, Remote Config, A/B Testing, Performance Monitoring, Crashlytics, Predictions and App Distribution (services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).
Those services help us to optimise our product, spot and fix issues and make sure that all APIs work properly.
The legal basis is Article 6 Paragraph 1 f) GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in analysing usage behaviour in order to improve and further develop the apps.
8. Advertising
In order to showcase relevant adverts to our users, we use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”), on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online service within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR) .
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active
).
We use the service AdMob for our apps, which will display ads in our app and reward us for their insertion or other use. For these purposes, usage data, such as the click on an ad and the IP address of the users are processed, whereby the IP address is shortened by the last two digits. Therefore, the processing of the users’ data is pseudonymised.
We use AdMob with personalised ads. In doing so, Google draws conclusions about their interests on the basis of the websites visited by users or used apps and the user profiles created in this way. Advertisers use this information to align their campaigns with these interests, which benefits users and advertisers alike. For Google, ads are personalised when collected or known data determines or influences ad selection. These include previous searches, activities, site visits, apps, demographics, and location information. Specifically, this includes demographic targeting, interest category targeting, re-marketing, and targeting of customer matching lists and audience lists uploaded to DoubleClick Bid Manager or Campaign Manager.
Further information on the use of data by Google, configuration and objection options can be found in Google’s data protection declaration (
https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
) and in the configuration for the display of advertising by Google (
https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated
).
9. Deactivating Ad IDs
You can also use settings in your operating system to prevent the delivery of personalised advertising. We will explain to you below – in separate terms according to the mobile operating systems for which we offer the app – how the activation or deactivation of the personalised advertising technologies (usage of advertising IDs) works. By deactivating you ensure that the delivered advertisement is no longer interest-based, as the Apple Ad-ID or Google Advertising ID is no longer used and information about your interaction with the app or advertisements can no longer be associated with an Advertising ID.
iOS
Open the “Settings” application of iOS and choose the menu item “Privacy” and then the sub-item “Advertising”. Activate the option “Limited Ad Tracking”, then we can only carry out limited measures, such as determining the unique user or combating fraud. In the same menu, you can reset the Ad ID at any time (“Reset Ad ID”), then a new ID will be created which will not be combined with the data which was previously collected.
Android
Open the application “Google settings” and select the menu point “Adverts”. Activate the “Deactivate interest related advertising” option, in order to prevent the creation of profiles and the display of interest related advertising. In the same menu, you reset the Google advertising ID at any time (“Reset advertising ID”), then a new ID will be created which will not be combined with the data which was previously collected.
