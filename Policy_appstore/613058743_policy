Data Processing
Accessing information from the server system may be logged by EchoSOS for the purpose of maintaining information and service security. Technical data about the user’s device, such as operating system version, app version, and IP address, is transmitted and stored with each access.
The following data is stored locally in the mobile app:
• User’s registered phone number
• Information provided by the user in the emergency pass
For the creation of a wallet pass, temporarily, the information required for creating the wallet entry, as provided by the user in the emergency pass, is transmitted to the server system (only for iOS devices).
Background location permission (only for Android devices) is required to automatically display your emergency pass (EchoID) using bluetooth beacons in the emergency rooms of our partner hospitals. This allows specialists to view vital information in an emergency. No location-related data is stored on our servers for this purpose, only when an emergency call is made (see next paragraph).
When making a call, the following data is temporarily transmitted to and stored in the server system:
• Phone number provided by the user
• Location provided by the user
The overall system uses statistical data (non-personal) to:
• Verify the stability and functionality of the system
• Obtain information about the general usage of the system
For sponsorship, EchoSOS collects the following personal data: first name, last name, address, email address. EchoSOS uses this data exclusively for the purpose of sponsor management.
Data Storage Location
The data is stored in the following locations:
• Data in the mobile app: locally on the user’s mobile phone
• Data in EchoSOS backend: Microsoft Azure in Switzerland
Purposes
The information systems are used to display emergency numbers in the apps, transmit location to emergency services, and create emergency passes.
EchoSOS also offers user location tracking by emergency services through the information system (echosos.com and Web Emergency Locator PRO).
Data Sharing
The provision of information from the information systems or the retrieval of such information by the apps is done through Amazon Web Services (AWS) Content Delivery Network.
When retrieving data from the app backends, the following technical data about the device is transmitted to AWS in Frankfurt:
• IP address
• Operating system version
• App version
Retention Period
We only store personal data for as long as necessary. The data is retained as follows:
• Data in the mobile app: until the app is deleted by the user
• Data in EchoSOS backend:
– Wallet: from the time of ordering a wallet entry until its creation (only for iOS devices).
– Emergency call: The personal data of the call: for one hour after transmission by the user. Afterward, the data is anonymized.
– Statistical data: until the system is deleted by the operator.
• If you are no longer a sponsor of EchoSOS, your data will be deleted.
Data Security
Ubique Health takes appropriate technical (e.g., encryption, logging, access controls and restrictions, data backup, IT and network security solutions, etc.) and organizational (e.g., instructions to employees, confidentiality agreements, reviews, etc.) security measures to protect data from unauthorized access, loss, and misuse.
