4.2. Additional explanations regarding the legal bases that we may use in order to carry out our processing activities from sections 2 and 3 of this notice:
4.2.1 When conducting processing activities in order to comply with a legal obligation
Summary: Our organisation may occasionally process personal data for the purposes of complying with legal requirements and other regulations, especially those governing taxes, invoicing and payments (an example of this may include a court, inspector or other holder of public authority ordering our organisation to provide it with access to certain information which may include personal data).
This may also be the case if someone else had filed for criminal or other legal procedures to be instituted against us by local or international law enforcement agencies or other tax and regulatory bodies, which might therefore contact our organisation for additional details (e.g. when data from our database would have to be presented as evidence in criminal or civil proceedings, otherwise our organisation would suffer material and irreparable damages). Note that we shall only fulfil such requests if specifically required by local or international law and shall adhere to anonymizing or at least minimising any personal data that we are required to share.
In the above stated cases we will always strive to fulfil the request with full transparency, except in cases where this might not be possible as (in accordance with a particular request of an authorised body) notifying the public of such request might endanger the proceedings at hand.
4.2.2 When our processing activities are based on our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of research entities with which we cooperate
Summary: In certain cases (i.e. when evaluating the threat of fraud), we may rely on our legitimate interests in order to process certain payment-, order- or account-related data or the legitimate interests of third (i.e. international research organisations) as described in sections 3.3. and 4.5.2 of this notice.
Our legitimate interests can also include instances where we process your personal data for our own internal business purposes and commercial interests, such as our own marketing activities (i.e. sending you marketing emails when you are our past customer unless consent is required under applicable laws, as described in point 2.3.1 of this notice), and offering additional customer and technical support.
Legitimate interests can also be displayed or claimed by third parties with which we cooperate (i.e. international research organisations) as described in sections 3.3. and 4.5.2 of this notice.
4.2.3 When our processing activities are based on your consent
Summary: When you will have given your consent for the processing of your data for one or more specific purposes (such as sending email marketing messages to new consenting customers as described in point 2.3.2 of this notice), your consenting to the processing of personal data is voluntary, whereby you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at
privacy@mybirdbuddy.com
(or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found in each of our marketing emails). If you do not provide personal data or if you withdraw your consent, this may mean that we will not always be able to fulfil the purposes for which we had collected the data.
Where consent has been withdrawn, we shall delete/anonymize any data we or our processors/service providers have kept on the basis of your consent.
Additionally, every effort will be made to remove relevant personal data from products/marketing campaigns and other distributions. However, this may not be possible in some situations, and in such cases, certain personal data that cannot be removed or otherwise anonymized (e.g. blurred) may still appear in publications, products and other media already in use or circulation.

This also includes instances when we need to communicate (i.e. negotiate) with you so that you may decide to enter into a contract with us (i.e. buy our product, accept a job position with us, etc.).
4.3 How long do we store your personal data and when do we delete/anonymize it?
Summary: choosing the “Remove” option in relation a photo/recording in the app does not immediately cause the permanent deletion of such data, since under the End User Licence Agreement we reserves the right to store and process photos/recordings that have been added or removed from a user’s collection in order to improve our machine learning models until such data is permanently removed (i.e. deleted) by you.
Should you decide to permanently remove (i.e. delete) a photo/recording please navigate to the relevant content/account deletion options in the app or contact us at
privacy@mybirdbuddy.com
, whereby we may, in accordance with our legitimate interests and to the extent permitted by applicable laws, subject the data you wish to delete to algorithmic or manual anonymization (i.e. anonymizing (blurring) photo/recording backgrounds, sounds or otherwise editing the recordings, removing metadata, IP data, feeder ID data, non-precise feeder location data and other potential data in a way which shall irreversibly prevent the photo/recording from being attributable to you or any other person in any way), and continue storing and processing such anonymized data in connection with our machine learning models.

4.5 Transferring personal data to third countries and international organisations / research organisations and measures for protecting such transferred data
4.5.1 Engaging contractual processors/service providers have their place of business registered in the USA or in other “third countries”
Summary: We operate globally and are thereby obliged to transfer your personal information to our main entity which is registered in the USA. The sale of our products and the provision of our services also require that we engage contractual processors/service providers as specified in sections 2 to 3 and point 4.4, whereby many of these processors/service providers have their place of business registered in the USA (or in other non-EEA countries where the GDPR is not applicable or where the requirements of the GDPR are not adequately reflected in national privacy laws, as the case may be).
As stated above, many of our processors/service providers have their place of business registered in the USA (or in other non-EEA countries where the GDPR is not applicable or where the requirements of the GDPR are not adequately reflected in national privacy laws, as the case may be) (hereinafter: “
third countries
”).
As stated above, we thereby regularly engage contractual processors/service who may process personal data on our behalf in third countries, whereby we only do so with the appropriate safeguards in place so that your data is safe and your data subject rights are respected.
Following decision C-311/18 (Schrems II) of the CJEU and the fall of the EU-US Privacy Shield we have reached out to our US-based processors/service providers and decided on alternative safeguards on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the guidance of the European Data Protection Board.
Where we could not put in place such appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses, data encryption, automated data deletion intervals, etc.), we ask for your specific consent before processing/sharing your data. More details on third country service providers and the measures taken to ensure your rights can be found in point 4.4 of this notice.
In addition to the purposes and providers listed in sections 2, 3 and point 4.4 of this notice, your data may also effectively be considered as transferred (i.e. disclosed) in the following situations, where we might have legitimate interests in buying/selling our assets in connection with entities that are registered in third countries:
If we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets that may be registered in a third country (whereby we shall only do so if all applicable confidentiality and security requirements are offered to us by any potential buyer and their organisation). Please note that we shall only do so if all applicable confidentiality and security requirements are offered to us by any potential buyer and their organisation and shall never disclose any data in this way if the processing of such data had been carried out on the basis of your explicit consent.
If all or a substantial part of our assets are acquired by a third party that may be registered in a third country whereby our assets may include parts of your data. Please note that we shall only do so if all applicable confidentiality and security requirements are offered to us by any potential buyer and their organisation and shall never disclose any data in this way if the processing of such data had been carried out on the basis of your explicit consent.
Your data may also effectively be considered as transferred (i.e. disclosed) if we are required on the basis of EU law or the law of a Member State to disclose or share your personal data with an international organisation / public authority or other entity that might be registered in a third country, whereby we are required to do so to comply with a legal obligation.
4.5.2 Disclosing data to international research organisations
Summary: We may also disclose certain photos/recordings or other data (such as non-precise feeder location data, timestamps, etc.) to scientific organisations involved in animal research (i.e. international ornithology research organisations).
We shall only do so when you have either explicitly authorised us to do so (i.e. gave us your explicit consent) or where we or our research partners might have legitimate interests in processing this data for research that is in the public interest.
We shall endeavour to put sufficient data protection measures in place prior to sharing your data with researchers and strive towards only offering data which had been either minimised or sufficiently and irreversibly anonymized (i.e. anonymizing (blurring) postcard/recording backgrounds, removing photo/recording metadata / IP data / feeder ID data, non-precise feeder location data and other potential data in a way which shall prevent the postcard or recording from being attributable to you in any way).
Please note that certain data may not always be anonymised (such as non-precise feeder location data) as this could make the content unusable or unsuitable for the particular research purpose in question. In these situations we shall conduct a “Legitimate Interest Assessment” and shall consider what implications sharing such content for the purposes of a particular research program might have for you as an individual.
In cases where anonymization of certain parts of the data might compromise the research purposes that are being pursued by the research organisation, we shall either obtain the prior explicit consent of all applicable users prior to sharing their data or implement other sufficient safeguards.
If the research organisation in question is registered or set up in a third country, we shall put in place the same appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses, data encryption, automated data deletion intervals, etc.) that we employ with our other third country processors/service providers (as stated above in point 4.5.1) or ask for your specific consent before processing/sharing your data.
You can obtain more detailed information on specific data transfers, safeguards and potential third country processors/service providers or research organisations we may be cooperating with by sending your questions to
privacy@mybirdbuddy.com

QUICK PRIVACY GUIDE​
Introduction
While your Bird Buddy feeder has been lovingly crafted so that we may all learn more about our feathered friends in new and exciting ways, birds aren’t the only shy creatures that might be photographed or recorded in your backyard or neighborhood forest.
Although the vast majority of all photos and recordings captured with our feeders contain no personally identifiable information (i.e. no photos or recordings of people) and other potentially identifiable information (i.e. car license plates, house numbers, etc.), you are kindly asked to always consider the privacy of everyone involved when setting up and using your feeder.
Feeder spots we love:
Calm, secluded areas, facing trees or other backdrops that aren’t typically filled with many people or buildings.
Feeder spots we do not recommend:
Public spaces, areas where people and cars congregate on a regular basis, areas in view of neighboring buildings and properties.
Like birds, your feeder prefers secluded spots without a lot of people.
Consider making your feeder extra inviting in case of shy birds and extra private in case of shy humans by placing it:
in your backyard with the camera facing towards your own home;
in front of your home while making extra sure that the camera is not facing somebody else’s (or a shared) doorway, window, car, parking lot, stairwell, or any potential neighboring property or public area;
in another kind of appropriate feeding spot that is not frequented by humans that could reasonably expect privacy at times when birds visit.
What to consider when setting up your feeder for the first time
While taking photos or recordings of non-human subjects on private property is typically allowed, we strongly recommend that you:
only set up and use the feeder in areas where capturing photos or recordings of people, cars, entryways or other information that may be tied to a particular individual, is least likely;
check with the owner of the property where the feeder shall be set up or check with the residents/occupants of the building/home/property that may be captured in the photos or recordings;
conduct your own research and gain a basic understanding of the relevant privacy requirements in relation to private video camera monitoring devices in your state or country prior to using the feeder (browse your country/state or local sheriff’s website for more information).
Interiors and public spaces
Always make sure that no interior of any commercial or private residence is in view and can be recorded during your use of the feeder (which may also include views of the interior of your own home).
Placing your feeder in view of public spaces is also discouraged, as not all country/state or national laws may view such areas as being tied to a lower expectation of privacy.
Please perform your own basic online search before committing to a feeder location that could potentially capture public spaces.
My feeder has captured an image of a person in the foreground, now what?
No problem, just remove the relevant photos or recordings by choosing the “Remove” option in your collection gallery.
Please also make sure to delete such photos or recordings from any other drives, databases and platforms, and check if you might have shared the image to our community.
Also consider changing the position or angle of the feeder to avoid similar situations in the future.
Other important legal information
Your Bird Buddy feeder is not a surveillance, security, or commercial monitoring device and should never be used for such purposes.
You are ultimately the one responsible for any photos or recordings that you capture with the feeder.
You are also the one responsible for storing, sharing or posting your photos or recordings online and elsewhere.
We take privacy very seriously at Bird Buddy Inc. and reserve the right to withhold the distribution of our services to users who misuse the feeder and pose a potential privacy risk to other individuals.
While Bird Buddy Inc. may from time to time publish “best practice” guides or blog posts (which includes this
Quick Privacy Guide
), as well as other information regarding the use and setup of the feeder, such materials are purely speculative in nature and are in no way intended to be understood or used as legal or other material advice, whereby Bird Buddy Inc. makes no representation or warranty with regards to such materials and information, and that no attorney-client relationship is created should you choose to use or act on such materials and information.

When you add a card to Apple Pay, card-related information, location, and information about device settings and use patterns may be sent to Apple to determine eligibility.
Some of the above information, account-related information, and paired-device details may be shared with your card issuer or bank to determine eligibility and for anti-fraud purposes.
When you use Apple Pay in apps and on the web, information necessary to process the payment is shared with the app or website. Your actual card number isn’t shared with the merchant.
Apple Pay data that can no longer be tied to you may be used by Apple to improve Apple Pay and other Apple products and services.
Apple Pay is a technology service provided by affiliates of Apple Inc., which are responsible for your personal data.
Apple Pay allows you to make secure purchases in stores, in apps, and on the web, using your debit, credit, and prepaid cards.
Apple Pay is a technology service provided by affiliates of Apple Inc., which are responsible for your personal data. Your Apple Pay provider may differ depending on your location, such as Apple Payments Services LLC in the United States. For more information on Apple entities responsible for the processing of your personal data, visit Apple’s Privacy Policy at
apple.com/privacy
and Apple-Affiliated Companies at
www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en/affiliated-company
.
Adding Cards to Apple Pay
When you are adding a payment card like store, credit, debit, and prepaid cards to Apple Pay, information you provide about your card, and whether certain device settings are enabled may be sent to Apple in order to determine your eligibility to enable Apple Pay and its features. Your device may also evaluate device use patterns (for example, percent of time device is in motion, approximate number of calls per week) to help identify fraud. The information evaluated by your device is not shared with Apple in a way that can be linked to you.
Your card issuer, payment network, or provider authorized by your card issuer may share information about card features and benefits with Apple, such as whether it supports a rewards or installments program, to determine eligibility for certain Apple Pay features. Information may also be provided by Apple to those entities to enable Apple Pay, determine card eligibility, set up your card with Apple Pay, and to prevent fraud, including:
Your credit, debit, or prepaid card number
The name and billing address associated with your Apple Account
General information about your Apple Account activity (for example, whether you have a long history of transactions within iTunes)
Information about your device and, if using Apple Watch, the paired iOS device (for example, a device identifier, phone number, and the name and model, for both your Apple Watch and paired iOS device)
Location at the time you add your card (if you have Location Services enabled)
Account or device history of adding payment cards
Aggregated stats relating to the information from payment cards you’ve added or attempted to add to Apple Pay
When you add a card to Apple Pay using a third-party app such as a banking app, the app sends an account or card identifier to your device. This information is used by Apple and your card issuer to determine the eligibility of your card, set up your card with Apple Pay, and to prevent fraud. To help you set up cards that you have, or have recently had, on other devices, Apple stores a card reference with your Apple Account that can be used with the card issuer or payment network to re-add the card after entering the security code. Apple Pay does not store the original credit, debit, or prepaid card number.
Paying with Apple Pay
When you begin a payment, to enable tax and shipping cost calculation your zip code, postal code, or other equivalent information may be provided to the app, website, or merchant. When you begin a payment within a third-party browser, the browser generates a QR code or an App Clip Code to scan with your Apple Pay-supporting device. Once scanned, Apple initiates a communication channel between the browser and the Apple Pay-supporting device, through which the browser and device share relevant transaction and billing and/or shipping information necessary to process the transaction.
If enhanced Apple Pay payment features such as the ability to pay with installments or rewards are enabled, after you initiate an Apple Pay purchase, Apple will identify the payment options available to you based on what cards you have in your Wallet and the benefits and features of those cards, which are provided to Apple by the card issuers. You may also choose to have Apple identify additional payment options that may be available to you and that are not yet in your Wallet. To do so, Apple will use information about your transaction, such as merchant and amount, to determine whether additional payment methods are available for that transaction. Apple does not retain information about the transaction and the payment method eligibility check in a manner that is linked to you. If you choose to apply for a new payment method, your application information will be shared directly with the issuer and will not be seen or stored by Apple. To help you make informed financial decisions, if you choose to pay with rewards, Apple may use information about your card, card features, and benefits, as well as the transaction merchant and amount, to fetch and display your current rewards balance, the rewards points (or equivalent) that would be charged for the transaction, and your rewards balance post transaction. To allow you to select the right installment plan for your financial health, Apple provides your participating issuers with merchant and amount information, which they use to evaluate eligibility and provide Apple with a list of installment options for display. Apple does not retain this information processed to provide enhanced Apple Pay payment features in a manner that is linked to you.
After you authorize the payment, other information requested by the merchant, such as a device- or merchant-specific account number, your shipping address, or email address, is also provided. The card number from your credit, debit, or prepaid card is not provided when you use Apple Pay.
To help ensure that any recurring or other merchant-initiated charges like subscriptions are authorized by you, when you choose to provide eligible Apple Pay payment methods to participating merchants for recurring or merchant-initiated charges, your issuer and/or payment network will approve and generate a merchant-specific account number to be used for such charges. Only that merchant-specific account number can be used by a participating merchant to authorize transactions without you taking a specific action. Apple will know which merchants are associated with your merchant-specific account numbers, but not what you purchased or how much you paid for it. You can manage your merchant-specific account numbers in Wallet by tapping the card and tapping the More button to view card details.
For cards with certain enhanced fraud prevention, when you attempt an online or in-app transaction, your device will evaluate information about your Apple Account, device, and location if you have enabled Location Services for Wallet, in order to develop on-device fraud prevention assessments. The output of the on-device fraud prevention assessments, but not the underlying data, will be sent to Apple and combined with information Apple knows about your device and account to develop Apple Pay transaction fraud prevention assessments. These transaction fraud prevention assessments may be shared with your payment network, together with a shipping address identifier and IP address if available, in order to prevent fraud at the time of transaction. The shipping address identifier differs per payment network and may be used to confirm whether shipping addresses for different transactions using a particular card on your device are the same in a way that does not reveal the underlying address. You can check whether a card has this enhanced fraud prevention at any time by going to the back of your payment credential in Wallet. To prevent the sharing of fraud prevention assessments with your payment network, you can select another card.
When using an app or visiting a website through Safari that uses Apple Pay in iOS, watchOS, or macOS, the app or website can check if you have Apple Pay enabled on that device. When visiting a website in Safari on an iOS device, or Mac to which a card cannot be added, the website can check if you have Apple Pay set up on an iPhone or Apple Watch using the same Apple Account. You can disable websites you visit from checking if Apple Pay is enabled by changing your settings. On iOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Advanced > Check for Apple Pay. On Mac, go to Safari > Settings > Advanced and deselect “Allow websites to check for Apple Pay and Apple Card”.
Safeguarding Your Payment Methods
Safeguarding Safari Payment Methods
To help safeguard your payment methods on the Apple ecosystem and take advantage of the benefits of Apple Pay privacy and security, your supported Apple Pay payment methods from Wallet will also be available in Safari AutoFill. When shopping online with Safari AutoFill, for websites, you can set up a virtual card number to hide your physical card number, if supported by your participating card network and issuer. To enable this functionality, Apple will send limited information about your payment method to your network or issuer (or their authorized third party), which will generate a virtual card number for your use when shopping online with Safari AutoFill. To manage your Apple Pay card numbers, including virtual card numbers, go to the back of your pass in Wallet and tap to see Card Information. You may also help to safeguard payment methods already in Safari AutoFill by paying with Apple Pay or a virtual card number rather than your physical card number. To manage, go to Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay and tap Use Apple Pay When Available. When enabled, limited information about your saved card in Safari AutoFill necessary to verify eligibility for Apple Pay will be sent to your payment network for verification. If your payment network indicates the card is eligible, Apple will add the payment method to Wallet and your network will generate an Apple Pay card number for enhanced online shopping protection.
Safeguarding Apple Account Payment Methods
To help you manage your payment methods on the Apple ecosystem, Apple may check whether any Apple Pay payment methods are eligible to be added as a payment method on file to your Apple Account and display those payment methods in Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping > Add Payment Method > Payment Method. When you conduct a transaction with your Apple Account, Apple may also check whether any Apple Account payment methods on file are eligible for Apple Pay. If so, to help safeguard your payment information, Apple may enable Apple Pay for that payment method. You can modify your Apple Account payment methods at any time by going to Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping.
Apple Transmits, But Does Not Store Your Payment Information
In order to securely transmit your payment information within apps, websites, and Business Chat, it is sent to Apple in encrypted form, where it is briefly decrypted and reencrypted with a merchant-specific key, so that only the merchant, the developer, or their payment processor can decrypt your payment information. When you make a payment on a Mac to which a card cannot be added, the Mac and the authorizing device communicate over an encrypted channel via Apple servers. Apple does not retain any of this information in a form that personally identifies you.
Apple Pay also allows you to make payments in third-party browsers and use devices supporting Apple Pay to authorize the transaction. When using this feature, Apple will create a communication channel between the third-party browser and your authorizing device via Apple servers to allow you to update your shipping and payment details, and provide your authorization. Your shipping and billing information, and information about merchant charges, such as tax or shipping fees associated with your purchase, will briefly be visible to Apple. Apple does not retain any of this information in a form that personally identifies you.
Apple Pay Order Tracking
To provide you with order tracking, upon making an Apple Pay purchase, a participating merchant sends your device-limited order information for your device to use to track your order. And, Apple provides the merchant with a merchant-specific device identifier and a push token that the merchant can use to provide the device with order updates. Apple facilitates merchant updates, but does not store order information, nor track how many, how often, or which merchants send order updates. Order tracking information is stored locally on your devices and is kept up-to-date across devices by syncing an encrypted copy, which cannot be accessed by Apple. You can manage your Apple Pay orders at any time by tapping to view your Orders, tapping on a specific order, and tapping Manage Order. You can also manage notifications about Orders by going to Orders, tapping the More button, then tapping Mute Notifications.
When you sign out of your account, your device may still retain limited information about orders for which the device is getting updates. This information will not be visible to device users, will be retained for a short time, and used by your device only to help stop updates from being sent to the device after sign-out to prevent unauthorized access to your order information.
Sharing Account Activity with Third-Party Apps
You can share your Apple Card, Savings, and Apple Cash account details and transaction history with participating personal financial management apps you trust from the App Store. Apps must request the ability to read your Apple Card, Savings, or Apple Cash account activity from Apple Pay in Wallet. You have control over the data that you share with these apps and can change what you share at any time. Account activity that you choose to share with a third-party app will be handled in accordance with that app’s privacy policy. Apple does not see or store your account details or transaction history when you share your account activity.
Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We process your Apple Pay personal data generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service, and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable local law.
Where applicable local law provides, we process the following categories of personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party, including information about:
Your account, such as whether your account is active
Your device, such as the type of device, the software version, and the device serial number
Your pass, such as information displayed on the pass
Your pass issuer, such as the third party authorized to provide updates to the pass
Your use of Apple Pay, for example, the number of Apple Pay passes that you have added
Your location
These legitimate interests include:
Adding and managing a pass
Helping to improve and optimize the service for you and others
Helping you to discover features that are most relevant to you
Checking eligibility
Providing you with services you request
Sending you communications about Apple Pay and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you
Preventing fraud and other malicious activity
Other Information
To determine eligibility for Wallet and Apple Pay features, when you tap a card in Wallet, Apple may check feature eligibility by looking at the country in which the card was issued and whether the issuer participates in the feature.
If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your device at the time you use it to make purchases in stores may be sent anonymously to Apple and will be used to help Apple Pay improve the accuracy of business names in the Wallet card transaction history and may be retained in aggregate to improve Apple Maps, Apple Pay, and Wallet. You can disable this location-based functionality of Apple Pay at any time on your iOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services and tapping to turn off Apple Pay Merchant Identification. On Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Location Services, then click to turn off Wallet.
To help improve Apple Pay, Apple collects information about your use of Apple Pay and stores that information in a way that does not identify you personally. This information includes the time it takes you to successfully add a card or complete a transaction using Apple Pay. Apple may also use this information to improve other Apple products and services, for marketing, and for fraud and security purposes.
The terms of any cardholder, user, merchant agreement, or other terms and conditions applicable to the use of the features of Apple Pay will continue to govern the use of your cards and their use in connection with Apple Pay, and such terms may have additional privacy policies. Neither Apple nor its affiliates providing Apple Pay is a bank and this notice is in addition to any notices you may receive from your bank. In the event that Apple suspects fraud in connection with use of Apple Pay, information about the potentially fraudulent Apple account and transactions may be shared with your card issuer or payment network provider to prevent fraud.
Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this notice and in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, or as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest period permissible under law.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at

Uses
For over two centuries, the Postal Service™ has valued your privacy, and built a brand that customers trust. Thank you for reviewing our privacy policy.
Our privacy policy tells you about our information practices when you provide personal information to us, whether collected online or offline, or when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. Personal information may include your name, email, mailing and/or business address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally.

Expand all
The following describes the ways we collect information from you, and the protections that apply to your information.
The Postal Service collects personal information from you and from your transactions with us. We use information we collect to provide you certain products and services, and if needed to respond to your inquiries or requests for information. We occasionally collect data about you from financial entities to perform verification services and from commercial sources. We do this, for example, to prepopulate data fields in call centers to facilitate transactions, or to market products to consumers who have agreed to receive such messages.
Privacy Act Rights
The Postal Service follows the privacy requirements of the Privacy Act, which protects your personal information that we maintain in what is called a system of records. A system of records is a file, database, or program from which personal information is retrieved by name or other personal identifier. In other words, the Privacy Act applies when we use your personal information to know who you are and to interact with you – such as when you provide information to request a product or service, register on usps.com, or submit an inquiry or complaint. The Privacy Act provides comprehensive protections for your personal information. This includes how information is collected, used, disclosed, stored, and discarded.
When we collect and maintain personal information from you offline, a Privacy Act notice will be provided. The following is your Privacy Act notice for personal information collected online:
Privacy Act notice: Your information will be used to provide you requested products, services, or information. Collection is authorized by 39 USC 401, 403, & 404. Providing the information is voluntary, but if not provided, we may not process your transaction. We do not disclose your information to third parties without your consent, except to facilitate the transaction, to act on your behalf or request, or as legally required. This includes the following limited circumstances: to a congressional office on your behalf; to financial entities regarding financial transaction issues; to a USPS auditor; to entities, including law enforcement, as required by law or in legal proceedings; to domestic and international customs relating to outgoing international mail pursuant to federal law and agreements; and to contractors and other entities aiding us to fulfill the service (service providers).

Information Collected from Emails and Online Forms
Many of our programs and websites allow you to send us an email. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry, provide information, or to fill your order for postal products and services in which you have expressed an interest.
Remember that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. If your email communication is very sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or social security number, you should send it by mail unless the Web site indicates the particular site is secured.
The Postal Service believes in permission-based marketing. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to outside marketers. You will only receive marketing about products and services of the Postal Service or its partners, other than products and services you already receive or are registered for, under the following conditions.
If you are a consumer, we use an opt-in standard. If you have provided personal information to register for or purchase a product or service, we will not use that information to contact you in the future about another product or service unless you have provided express consent.
If you are a business, we use an opt-out standard. We assume you are interested in other products and services that could aid you in your business, and so we will provide information to you unless you tell us you do not want to receive it.
Consumers may opt-in, and businesses may opt-out, when they register on usps.com and create a customer profile. These preferences in the profile can be changed at any time. Please contact the privacy office at the addresses below with any questions about your preferences.
In those instances where we secure your personal information in transit to us and upon receipt, the Postal Service uses the industry standard encryption software, Secured Socket Layer (SSL). The URL in your browser will change to "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate this secure transmission is in place.
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the Postal Service employs software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this policy. Unauthorized modification or misuse of information stored in this system will be investigated and may result in criminal prosecution.
U.S. Postal Service® information systems may be protected by EINSTEIN cybersecurity capabilities, under the operational control of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Electronic communications with the Postal Service may be scanned by government-owned or contractor equipment to look for network traffic indicating known or suspected malicious cyber activity, including malicious content or communications. Electronic communications within the Postal Service will be collected or retained by US-CERT only if they are associated with known or suspected cyber threats. US-CERT will use the information collected through EINSTEIN to analyze the known or suspected cyber threat and help the Postal Service and other agencies respond and better protect their computers and networks.
For additional information about EINSTEIN capabilities, please see the EINSTEIN program-related Privacy Impact Assessments available on the DHS cybersecurity privacy website
http://www.dhs.gov/files/publications/editorial_0514.shtm#4
, along with other information about the federal government's cybersecurity activities.
Service Providers
The Postal Service enters into relationships with service providers in order to provide the highest quality product or service. Service providers may include an entity that provides assistance for the program, such as a call center; a provider of advertising services; or a partner for the program. The USPS holds service providers to the same rigorous standards of privacy that apply to the USPS, including being made subject to the Privacy Act and USPS privacy policies. Service providers that have access to personal information are also subject to security review.
If you have provided personal information to us, you may request to review the information that we have maintained. Please contact the program office that provided you the product or service, the office that handled your inquiry, or the privacy office at the addresses below. We will correct or delete any inaccurate information upon your request.
We would like to hear from you if you have any questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or use of your information.
Please contact us at
privacy@usps.gov
*, or mail us at:
PRIVACY OFFICE
US POSTAL SERVICE
475 L'ENFANT PLZ SW RM 9431
WASHINGTON DC 20260-1101
We will investigate and respond to your inquiry. Your inquiry will be treated confidentially and will be protected under the Privacy Act.

Information Collected and Stored Automatically
We automatically collect certain information about your visit to usps.com. We limit the data collected to meet specific business needs and to fully protect your privacy. We thus may know what path(s) you took on usps.com, but we don't know who you are. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not use this information to identify you personally without your express consent.
We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:
General log information—Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" or "yourschool.edu"); Internet Protocol (IP) address; operating system; the browser used to access our Web site; the date and time you access our site; and the pages that you visited. Additionally, we collect information that identifies the software acting on your behalf (i.e., your user agent) and the device that you are using if you access the site through a mobile or wireless network. We use the information to help us make usps.com more useful to visitors. We use it to learn about how locations on our site are being used, what information is of most and least interest, and to ensure usps.com can interface with the types of technology our visitors use. We also use the information to tell us of any possible site performance problems and to identify, prevent, or mitigate the effects of fraudulent transactions.
Referral and statistical information where we have links or ad banners to or from usps.com. Such data may include aggregate data such as the number of click-throughs that occurred. It may also include specific data, such as whether you are a repeat visitor; whether you visited a page with a banner on it or clicked on an ad banner and then used our site (for instance, to register or make a purchase); the value, date and time of any sale; and the identity of the site which you linked to or from usps.com. We collect this information to know which links and banners are effective. For example, this allows us to determine which ads may be of most interest and to help us control how many times a specific ad is displayed.
How Data Is Collected - Cookies and Other Web Analysis Tools
We understand that you may have questions about Web technology and information that is collected as you surf or conduct business online. The Postal Service has very strict policies about Web analysis tools. Such tools include what are known as cookies and Web beacons.
The Postal Service uses a third-party analytics provider (currently Google Analytics Premium) to analyze data from cookies. The third-party analytics provider does not receive personally identifiable information through these cookies and is prohibited from combining, matching or cross-referencing usps.com information with any other information. We have also limited the provider's ability to see your full IP address (a process known as "IP masking"). Please refer to
Google Analytics security and privacy principles
for more information.
The Postal Service strictly limits the types of analysis tools allowed, the data collected, and how long the tools last, in order to best serve your business needs and also safeguard your privacy. The types of Web analysis tools we use are fully explained below, and in the attached letter from the Postmaster General.
Postmaster General's Letter on Cookie Usage

HTM
Cookies
Cookies may be categorized as session or persistent, which describes the length of time that they stay on your system. Both session and persistent cookies are used on this site. The following are detailed descriptions of how we use these cookies.
Session Cookies
A session cookie is a small piece of textual information that a server places temporarily on your browser during the time your browser is open. The cookies are erased once you close all browsers. We use session cookies in the following manner:
Log-on and log-off administration—If you decide to register with our site, so as, for example, to use one of our online services, session cookies help with the log-on and log-off process. The cookies enable us to recognize your log-on ID when you log on so that we do not establish a duplicate registration record for you.
Transactions and site usability — We use session cookies to improve how you navigate through usps.com and conduct transactions. As examples, session cookies are used to maintain your online session as you browse over several pages; to store and prepopulate information so that you do not have to reenter the same information twice; to enable the postage rate calculator; and to retain your shopping cart information. Session cookies may also be used to collect referral statistics when you click on a link or ad banner to or from usps.com.
Persistent Cookies
A persistent cookie is a small piece of text stored on your computer's hard drive for a defined period of time, after which the cookie is erased. We do not collect or link to personal information through persistent cookies without your express consent. We use persistent cookies as follows:
Site usage measurement—Our site measurement tool uses a persistent cookie to assist us in measuring how and when our Web site and its various components are used. It functions as a "visit cookie," so that we can determine if you are a repeat visitor to our site. This allows us to know if we are attracting new visitors and what aspects of the site seem most useful. The cookie will expire 30 days after your last visit.
Log-off safety function—The USPS uses a persistent cookie to automatically log you off of usps.com if there has been no activity for 15 minutes. This is done for your safety to ensure that, if you have finished using our site, but have forgotten to log off, no one else can use your computer via your log-on and password. The cookie is permanently removed from your computer when you log off, or, if you have closed the browser without logging off, it is removed within 15 minutes from your last activity.
Opt-in cookies—Persistent cookies allow us, at your request, to recognize you when you return to usps.com, or to remember certain information that you have provided us. The recognition feature allows you to log on to usps.com automatically, without having to enter your name and password each visit. The cookie assigns a random number to you, which we link to personal information you have provided and your purchase history. This allows us to personalize the site for you and tailor the content to your needs, for instance to show you other products you may be interested in. Other cookies allow us to remember certain information related to prior transactions, such as package tracking numbers, or mailing or address lists, so that we may prepopulate those fields for you on return visits. These features and cookies are strictly at your option and for your convenience. We will also present you with a convenient way to remove the cookies, via where you manage your account, if you decide later that you want to terminate one or more of these functions. The cookies will expire one year from your last visit.
Ad banner cookies—On behalf of the USPS, persistent cookies and beacons (described below) may be set and managed by third party advertising suppliers to support ad banners. Ad banner cookies are set when you view or click on an ad banner on usps.com, or an ad banner on another site for a USPS product, and persist for no more than five years.
Web Beacons
A Web beacon, also referred to as a clear gif or page tag, consists of code on the USPS site that delivers a small graphic image from another Web site or third party server. They may not be visible as the beacon is generally a 1x1 pixel that is often designed to blend into the background of a Web page.
We use beacons, often in conjunction with cookies, to monitor the effectiveness of ad banners; and to gather general log, statistical, and referral information. We do not use beacons to store or link to personal information. We thus use beacons to understand certain actions that you took (such as a purchase), but not to know who you are.
Third Party Web Analysis Tools
The Postal Service does not allow Web analysis tools to be used by third parties, except for service providers who help us in performing site analysis or providing a particular product, service, or advertisement. Service providers may use session cookies, just like the USPS does, solely to improve the use of the site. Service providers may only use persistent cookies and beacons if specifically approved by the USPS, which uses must comply fully with this policy.
Data Derived from Web Analysis Tools
We are careful to safeguard any data derived from cookies and beacons. No data derived from session cookies, or from the log-off persistent cookie, are retained. Data derived from other persistent cookies and beacons are retained behind the USPS firewall or a secure firewall of our service provider.
Opting Out of Web Analysis Tools
If you still have concerns about cookies, you may choose to opt out of their use.
Ad banner cookies – You can opt out of ad banner cookies, without erasing or altering other cookies. If you opt out of these cookies, we will no longer track any information from ad banners related to a specific user's visit. By clicking below, you will be taken to a third party site that explains how to opt out.
Click here to learn how to opt out of ad banner cookie.
Opting out of all cookies – You may choose to opt out of the use of all cookies. You will still be able to access most features of usps.com. However, certain features may not work as well or may be unavailable to you. You will not be able to register or purchase from usps.com because we need cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to process your transaction.
Click here to learn how to opt out of all cookies.
Information from Children
From time to time as part of a special Postal Service promotion, such as stamp collecting, we may request information from children under 13 years of age. We will do so only with parental notice and consent. We will take all necessary steps to protect the privacy and safety of any child participating, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Postal Service Collection of Information from Children
We will post a notice that we are requesting information from children including the type of information, how we will use it, whether it will be forwarded to a third party, and a contact at our Web site for questions. We will utilize the information only for the given Postal Service promotion. We will not condition a child's participation in an event on the provision of more information than is absolutely necessary for that promotion. An example of such a promotion could be a stamp-collecting program that might be of interest to children.
Obtaining Verifiable Parental Consent
We will use reasonable effort to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under 13. The method of parental consent verification may vary according to the event in which the child wishes to participate. Means of obtaining such consent may include, but are not limited to, offline consent such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail or fax, or online consent that contains a verifiable unique identifier such as a credit card.
Parental Review
The U.S. Postal Service will allow parents to review any personal information collected from their children, based on verifying the identity of the consenting parent. Parents may revoke their consent and delete information collected from their children at their discretion. The Postal Service will then stop collecting, using, or disclosing information from that child, and will end that child's participation in that event if such information is necessary to continue. We will also alert parents if the event or activity changes either the type of information collected or the way in which the site uses the information.
When Parental Consent is Not Required
We do not require parental consent in order to collect and use online contact information to:
respond directly to a child's request on a one-time basis to a specific request where the information is not used to recontact the child for other purposes;
request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification;
respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child and not used to recontact the child beyond the scope of that request.
Notification to Children
The U.S. Postal Service will provide a prominent notice to children describing in age appropriate terms what personally identifiable information will be collected, and explain the need for those children to obtain parental consent before sharing their information.

Introduction
Policy overview
FedEx Corporation and its operating groups, subsidiaries and divisions (hereafter “FedEx”) recognizes the importance of having effective privacy protections in place and is committed to compliance with applicable data privacy laws, regulations, internal policies and standards. These protections form the foundation of a trustworthy company; are necessary to maintain the confidence of customers and employees; and ensure the company’s own compliance with such local laws. This Global Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is based on globally accepted, basic principles on data protection.
Scope
This Policy applies worldwide to all employees and companies of FedEx. Individual operating companies may not adopt policies inconsistent with this Policy. Supplemental data protection requirements for individual operating companies, regions or countries may be created with the approval of the Global Chief Compliance and Governance Officer (“GCCGO”).
Application of local laws
Each operating company of FedEx is responsible for compliance with this Policy. If there is reason to believe that local law requirements or other legal obligations contradict the duties under this Policy, the relevant operating company must inform the GCCGO. In the event of conflicts between applicable local laws, rules or regulations and the Policy, FedEx will work to find a practical solution that reconciles these requirements.
Definitions
Personal data
Any information that can directly or indirectly be used to identify a natural person, whether that individual is an employee, a customer or employee of a customer, a vendor or employee of a vendor, a job applicant or any other third party.
Examples:
Names
Government-issued identification numbers (social security and driver’s license numbers, etc.)
Addresses
Phone numbers
Email addresses
Photos
Processing
Any operation performed on Personal Data, with or without the use of automated systems, such as to collect, store, organize, retain, archive, record, view, modify, adapt, alter, query, use, retrieve, forward, transmit or combine data. This also includes disposing of, deleting, erasing, destroying or blocking data.
Examples:
Storing information in databases
Viewing information stored on another computer
Transferring information from one database to another
Notes
Data that has been anonymized such that individuals cannot be identified does not constitute Personal Data.
The transportation of physical media (documents, computers, etc.) containing Personal Data does not constitute Processing of that Personal Data.
Data protection principles
Overview
Personal Data will be collected, recorded and used in a proper and professional manner, whether the Personal Data is on paper, in computer records or recorded by any other means.
FedEx is accountable for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the following principles of data protection.
Fair and lawful
When Processing Personal Data, the rights of the individual related to their Personal Data must be protected. Personal Data must be collected and Processed fairly and lawfully.
Purpose specification
Personal Data can be used or Processed only for the purpose defined at the time of collection and shall not be further used or Processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose. Personal Data may not be collected and stored for potential future use unless allowed by local law.
Collection limitation
FedEx only collects Personal Data necessary to meet the specified purpose at the time of collection and only to the extent allowed by local law.
Deletion
Personal Data no longer needed for the purpose specified at the time of collection shall be deleted according to applicable retention schedules unless it is subject to an exception from the Legal Department.
Data quality
Personal Data should be accurate, and if necessary, kept up to date.
Security safeguards
Personal Data must be protected using technical, managerial and physical security measures against risk of loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.
Transparency
Individuals must be notified at the time of collection how their Personal Data is being used or Processed. They must be aware of who is collecting the Personal Data, the purpose for the Processing of the Personal Data and if third parties will Process the Personal Data, that adequate safeguards are in place. All such notices must be approved by the Legal Department.
Individual participation
To the extent required by local law, individuals have a right to access their Personal Data and, where appropriate, to correct or delete it and exercise any other right provided by local law.
Security and access
Personal Data
Personal Data is classified as confidential. Any unauthorized Processing of such data by employees is prohibited. Any Processing undertaken by an employee that is not part of his or her legitimate duties is prohibited. Employees may have access to Personal Data only as is appropriate for the type and scope of the task in question. This requires the definition and separation, as well as implementation, of roles and responsibilities.
Employees are prohibited from using Personal Data outside of the scope of their employment at FedEx, to disclose it to unauthorized persons or to make it available in any other way outside the permitted business use. Supervisors must inform their employees at the start of the employment relationship about the obligation to protect Personal Data. This obligation shall remain in force even after employment has ended.
Personal Data must be safeguarded from unauthorized access and unlawful Processing or disclosure. This applies regardless of whether data is Processed electronically or in paper form. Before the introduction of new methods of data Processing, a privacy impact assessment should be performed for new IT systems, which may lead to implementing technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data.
Employees are expected to follow FedEx Information Security Standards, which can be found by searching keyword “standards.” Note that Information Security classifies all data as Sensitive, Internal or Public. Depending on its classification, Personal Data must be protected in accordance with the applicable Information Security Standards.
In the event of suspicious activity, suspected cyberattack, suspected security incident or possible breach of Personal Data, all FedEx employees must notify Information Security immediately via the Incident Notification Website, keyword “incident,” or call (901)224-2021 or (901)224-2022 to report the incident.
Special circumstances
Data transferring or processing by third parties
Personal Data may not be transferred to a country outside the country of origin unless the transfer has been approved by the Legal Department, who will ensure an adequate level of data protection or suitable safeguards are in place. If a vendor or third party is engaged to Process Personal Data, a data transfer agreement must be in place with that external provider. An external provider can Process Personal Data only in accordance with instructions from FedEx.
Processing of special categories of Personal Data
Special categories of Personal Data that are highly sensitive can be Processed only under certain conditions. These categories include an individual’s racial and ethnic origin, political beliefs, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership or the health and sexual life of the data subject. Under local law(s), further data categories may necessitate special treatment. Personal Data that relates to a crime can often be Processed under special requirements of local law. Leave requests, that include special categories of data, will be handled by local Human Resources and Legal Departments.
If there are plans to implement a new system, procedure or Process that includes Personal Data in a special category, the GCCGO must be informed in advance.
Telecommunications and internet
Telephone equipment, email addresses, intranet and Internet, along with internal social networks, are provided primarily for work-related assignments. They can be used within the applicable legal regulations and internal policies. In the event of limited acceptable usage for private purposes, the local laws on secrecy of telecommunications and any local telecommunication laws must be observed.

Visiting our Website
DHL is committed to preserving the privacy of users of our websites. When you visit our web pages, our web servers always temporarily save for connection and set up and security purposes the connection data of the computer connecting to our site, a list of the web pages that you visit within our site, the date and duration of your visit, the IP address of your device, the identification data of the type of browser and operation system used as well as the website through which you linked to our site. Additional personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. while completing an online contact form, as part of a registration, survey, competition, fulfillment of contract or an information request.
The legal basis for the processing of the aforementioned data categories is Art. 6 (1) (a) of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Due to the said purposes, in particular to guarantee security and a smooth connection setup, we have a legitimate interest to process this data.
The web tracking data stored on our servers will be kept for a period of 24 months and then automatically deleted. Furthermore this website uses cookies and similar technologies, (hereafter “technologies”). You will find more details
here
.
Processing for Advertising Purposes
If you register for one of our newsletters, we are entitled to use your e-mail address for this purpose. The legal basis for this data processing is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You may unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking the relevant link at the bottom of the newsletter. You can also revoke the consent at any time with effect for the future using the contact address provided. If you unsubscribe from our e-mail communications or revoke your consent, the corresponding data will be removed or blocked from the mailing list and will no longer be processed for these purposes. Including your e-mail address in a blocking list is effected in order to safeguard our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in us not sending you any information by e-mail in the future.
We use tracking software to determine how many users visit our website and how often. We do not use this software to collect individual personal data or individual IP addresses. The data are used solely in anonymous and summarized form for statistical purposes and for developing the website.
We use the online advertising program “Google AdWords” and the conversion tracking function of Google AdWords. Google conversion tracking is an analytics service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”).
When you click on an ad delivered by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days, do not contain any personal data and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can tell that you clicked on the ad and were directed to that page. Each Google AdWords customer has a different cookie, so it is not possible to track cookies via websites of other AdWords customers. The information collected by means of the conversion cookie is used to compile conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers can see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page containing a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive information that enables them to identify users personally. If you do not want to participate in conversion tracking, you can opt out of this use and prevent cookies from being installed by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software (deactivation option). You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics. Further information and Google’s Privacy Policy are available at:

DHL provides its services in accordance with all applicable data protection laws, including the PDPA, and the Deutsche Post DHL Data Privacy Policy. DHL collects, uses and discloses Personal Data for purposes as notified to you or as permitted by law.
Pursuant to the PDPA, “Personal Data” means any data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from (a) that data alone; or (b) that data and other information which DHL has or is likely to have access.
DHL may collect your Personal Data:
that you have voluntarily provided to DHL, its agents and/or business partners;
when you contact or request assistance from DHL, its agents and/or business partners;
when you participate in offers, competitions, surveys and/or lucky draw opportunities;
from your use or supply of services and/or products provided by or to DHL, its agents and/or business partners;

where you are the recipient of a shipment delivered by DHL, its agents or business partners;
when you apply for a job with DHL; and/or
when you access DHL’s, its agents’ and/or business partners’ premises.
Where the Personal Data is indicated as being mandatory, DHL may in certain instances be faced with delays or be unable to provide you with the contracted services and/or products which you may require should you fail to provide DHL with the required Personal Data. When browsing DHL’s websites and/or applications, you may choose to configure your browser settings to disable all cookies or the like. Please be reminded that should you choose not to accept the cookies, certain functionalities (e.g. banner redirection) may not be available.
DHL collects, uses or discloses your Personal Data for its legitimate functions, including but not limited to:
effecting delivery of shipments locally or abroad;
providing, monitoring and improving DHL’s services;
managing and administering your account(s) with DHL;
advertising products and services provided by DHL;
sourcing of supply of services and/or products to DHL;
recruitment or other employment purposes; and/or
such other purposes as may be required for the running of DHL’s services and businesses or by applicable laws or regulations, including the communication of the same to customs authorities.
Any use of your Personal Data by DHL for direct marketing or any directly related purposes would be in accordance with all applicable data protection laws, including the PDPA and the DPDHL Data Privacy Policy. DHL will only use your Personal Data for direct marketing or any directly related purposes after your consent has been duly obtained and you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time.
Where you provide DHL with Personal Data relating to third parties, you confirm that you are authorized to or have obtained the prior consent of such third parties before providing DHL with the same.
DHL may disclose the Personal Data collected to other members of the Deutsche Post DHL group of companies and to DHL’s agents, suppliers and business partners, whether based in Singapore or abroad, who are involved in the fulfilment of your requests or the services and/or products contracted for.
DHL may also disclose the Personal Data collected to third parties (whether based in Singapore or abroad) who assist DHL with certain of its internal functions, including but not limited to invoicing and the mailing of account statements, credit reference checks, transportation services and information technology services. These third parties are bound to abide by applicable laws and/or DHL’s policies relating to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data.
If DHL transfers your Personal Data to countries outside of Singapore, DHL will obtain your consent for the transfer to be made and DHL will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data continues to receive a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that provided under the PDPA.
DHL wishes to assure you that other than in the instances stated herein and for any other legitimate purposes, DHL will not share, sell, rent, trade and/or disclose your Personal Data to any unauthorised third party in contravention of applicable laws unless your consent has been duly obtained.
In Singapore, the PDPA grants you certain rights to seek access to and/or correct your Personal Data provided to DHL.

Alert on Fraudulent Emails
As the leader in international shipping, the DHL brand is known around the world. DHL takes protecting our customers and their sensitive information seriously. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to be on the alert for fraudulent emails sent by malicious third parties falsely claiming the DHL brand and name. These unauthorised emails often bear images such as official-looking logos to mislead recipients.
False Payment Notice
In most cases, these emails solicit for payment to be made by online shoppers for the delivery of consumer goods purchased over the Internet.
Please be advised that DHL does not request direct payment from online consumers. DHL only collects money due for shipping arrangements made between a consigner and a consignee.
A receiver is still obligated to pay shipping, customs, VAT or similar charges, where these are properly payable at the time of delivery. DHL accepts no responsibility for any costs, charges or payments incurred as a result of fraudulent activity.
SPAM
If you receive an email requesting you to open an email attachment in order to confirm a delivery by DHL, this email is fraudulent and the attachment may be a computer virus.
Phishing
You should be wary of emails appearing to be from DHL, but requesting personal information such as username, passwords, bank account or credit card details. These phishing emails might include links that direct you to a spoofed website or online form where you are asked to enter personal information.
If a link appears suspicious, please do not click on it.
In general, DHL recommends not opening attachments or clicking on links in emails identified as being “from” DHL, if one or more of the following is the case:
You are not doing business with DHL
The email is asking for personal or confidential information
The email contains suspicious-looking links or attachments
You are instructed to open an attachment for more details, including the tracking number
The email does not come with a valid tracking number

Contract

Where we are processing personal data is based on contract, we generally will retain your personal data for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from our contractual relationship.
Legitimate Interests
.
Where we are processing personal data based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account your fundamental interests and your rights and freedoms.

Legal Claim

We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to establish a claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads

Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites.

The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.

sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.

similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.

For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

When you sign in with your Apple Account, you will enable services such as iCloud, the App Store, iMessage, and Find My on this iPhone.
Certain data, including your contacts, calendars, photos, documents, health, activity, and other app data, will be sent to Apple to store and back up on your behalf.
In addition, your device will be associated with your Apple Account to provide you with better service and support.
Your Apple Account and all Apple services are designed from the ground up to protect your privacy. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better. When we do collect data, we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices.
An Apple Account is the personal account you use to access Apple services like iCloud, the App Store and other Apple online stores, iMessage, and FaceTime, and to access your content across all your devices and the web. Your Apple Account includes the information you use to sign in, as well as all the contact, payment, and security details, such as trusted phone numbers or security questions, that you use across Apple services. Apple retains your device’s name, serial number, and other hardware identifiers to provide you with better service and support, including as a convenience to display the warranty status of your device and to check your eligibility for service offers when you activate a device. You can edit your Apple Account information and view a list of your devices and phone numbers on your Apple Account page at
account.apple.com
.
When you sign in with your Apple Account, you will enable services such as iCloud, the App Store, iMessage, FaceTime, and Find My on this iPhone. Your Apple Account information, including your associated phone number, will be used with each service, which will generate analytics information that may be used to maintain and improve those services. Additionally, certain data from your device, including your selected profile photo, your contacts, calendars, photos, documents, health, activity, Safari tabs, and other app data, will be sent to Apple to store and back up on your behalf.
Apple collects information associated with your Apple Account to determine whether your device is eligible for certain legally required features and services, which are based on the country or region in which your device is located. We also collect information about the apps you install, including from where you install them (for example, a website or app marketplace), associated with your Apple Account for accounting, reporting, analytics, and fraud detection purposes in connection with the enablement of these legally required features and services. In addition, we use the age associated with your Apple Account to comply with our obligations, including providing age-appropriate information about your privacy rights in certain cases.
iCloud and Privacy
Signing in to iCloud
When you use iCloud, certain data you store on your device will be automatically sent to and stored by Apple. This allows you to access your data on all your iCloud-enabled devices or computers (“devices”) automatically. This data may include:
Contacts
Calendars
Reminders
Bookmarks
Safari tabs
Health data
Home data
Notes
Freeform
Photos
Documents
Wallet data
Keychain and passwords
Phone number on your device
Device and account settings
Data from other Apple apps that use iCloud
Data from third-party apps that use iCloud
iCloud Backup is also enabled to help ensure you have a current backup of the data on your device in case you need to replace or restore it.
You can adjust which iCloud features are enabled and what data is sent to iCloud from Settings on your device at any time.
iCloud Data Security
iCloud protects your information by encrypting it when it’s in transit, storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication. For certain information, Apple uses end-to-end encryption. This means that, by design, only you can access this information, and only on devices where you’re signed in to iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information. For more information on iCloud Data Security, visit
support.apple.com/102651
.
Both Apple and third-party data centers may be used to store and process your data. When processing data stored in a third-party data center, encryption keys are accessed only by Apple software running on secure servers, and only while conducting the necessary processing.
iCloud Keychain
iCloud Keychain keeps your Safari website usernames and passwords, credit card information, and Wi-Fi network information up to date and available across all your devices. It can also store the account information you use for Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Messages, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other internet accounts and automatically add this information to all of your devices.
iCloud Keychain uses end-to-end encryption and is designed so that only you can access this information and only on devices where you’re signed in to iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access your iCloud keychain data. You can choose to turn off iCloud Keychain in your iCloud settings at any time.
iCloud Backup
When you use iCloud Backup, your backup may include photos, videos, messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), Health and other app data, location settings (such as location-based reminders that you have set up), Visual Voicemail, device settings, device characteristics, and other data from your iOS or iPadOS device depending on your Settings.
You can stop iCloud from backing up your app data for a particular app by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups, selecting your iOS or iPadOS device in the Backups section, and tapping to turn off the apps for which you’d like to disable backup.
You can turn off iCloud Backup entirely from iCloud settings and use Finder (macOS Catalina 10.15 or later) or iTunes (macOS Mojave 10.14 or earlier) to back up your iOS or iPadOS device to your computer. To completely remove your backup data from iCloud, you can delete your individual backups before turning off iCloud Backup. Otherwise, the backup data will be retained for up to 180 days.
Sharing Data with iCloud
If you use iCloud to share files either publicly or privately in Notes, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Freeform, and certain third-party apps, Apple will store and have access to the shared file. Your first and last name associated with your account (if applicable), the phone number on your device, and the file name will be available to anyone who has access to the sharing link, regardless of whether your share is private or public. The identities of private share participants will not be made available to anyone who has not been invited to and accepted the private share.
If you create or join a Shared Library, all participants can add, edit, or delete photos and videos in the Shared Library through iCloud. There are several ways to add content to a Shared Library either manually or with automatic sharing. You can control how you want to share content by going to Settings > Photos > Shared Library > Share from Camera on your iOS or iPadOS device.
iCloud and Apps
Some apps use iCloud to store data and content you provide to the app, so you can access the data across all your iCloud-enabled devices. The app may choose to store some or all of your data in iCloud. Third-party apps can request to look you up, so that other users of that application can see your first and last name when they search by Apple Account.
You can stop an app from storing data in iCloud by turning off its access to iCloud. To do so, go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud, and tap to turn off apps shown in the list.
Apple Services That Require iCloud
To use Apple services like Apple Pay, Activity sharing, Home, Handoff, Universal Clipboard, and Unlock with Apple Watch, you must be signed in to iCloud on your device. Apple uses your iCloud plan to verify your eligibility to set up and use Secure Camera Recording in the Home app. Apple can’t access the content of your camera recordings. You do not need to use all iCloud features and can turn off any iCloud features you don’t want to use in iCloud settings on your device.
Signing Out of iCloud
If you want to stop using iCloud on your iOS or iPadOS device and any paired Apple Watch, you can sign out of iCloud by going to Settings > [your name] and tapping Sign Out. To stop using iCloud on your Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] and click Sign Out. Your Apple Account password may be required.
Communicating with You
Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own, the Apple apps you download, devices registered to your account, and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about iCloud and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, including Apple One. Your device serial number may be used to check eligibility for service offers. If you are in a Family Sharing group, Apple may send you communications about products, services, and offers available to you through Family Sharing. If you purchase an Apple One subscription, we may send you communications about the features of each of the services for which you have subscribed.
Email Marketing
You may receive these communications by email, if you consent to receive email marketing. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to
account.apple.com
, or on your iOS or iPadOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > Personal Information.
Push Notifications
You may also receive these communications by push notification. To update your notification preferences or to opt out of notifications on your iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > Notifications.
Family Sharing
Family Sharing lets you and your family group share subscriptions, purchases, and location. The family organizer can set up parental controls such as Ask to Buy and Screen Time for children in the family group. If a member of your family group signs in to certain Apple devices, such as Apple TV, the device may suggest adding other members of your family by displaying their Apple Account name and profile photo. For more information on Family Sharing, visit
www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/family-sharing
.
iMessage, FaceTime, and iCloud
When you sign in with your Apple Account on your iPhone, you will be signed in to iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud, and other Apple services automatically. The phone number on your device will also be verified and associated with your Apple Account. Your Apple Account or phone numbers will be shown to the people you contact or share data with, and people can reach you using your Apple Account, and email addresses or phone numbers on your account. You can choose how people can reach you by going to Settings > [your name] > Personal Information. You can also learn more about iMessage and FaceTime and Privacy by going to Settings > Messages and tapping About iMessage and FaceTime & Privacy.
iTunes and App Store and Music
When you sign in with your Apple Account on your iPhone, you will be signed in to the iTunes Store, the App Store, and Apple Music automatically so that you can make purchases or begin using Apple Music quickly and easily. Any purchases you choose to make will be recorded in our systems so you can redownload them at any time. If you use Apple Music, your listening history may be retained and used to help provide personalized recommendations. You can choose not to share your listening history from Apple Music settings.
If iTunes Match is available in your region and you use iTunes Match, iCloud will collect information about media in your iTunes library, and either match media to songs currently available in the iTunes Store or upload songs that cannot be matched, after which those songs can be accessed by your eligible devices.
Apple Subscriptions Through Partners
If your mobile network provider or another Apple partner offers subscriptions and free trials to Apple services (such as Apple One, Apple Music, or Apple TV+) Apple will use your phone number or a unique account identifier shared by the partner to identify the free trial or subscription, verify your account at sign in, and to connect your Apple subscription or free trial to your Apple Account. We will also use the phone number or unique account identifier to let the mobile network provider or partner know that you have activated your free trial or subscription.
Payment Methods, Gift Cards, and Adding Funds to Apple Account Balance
To make purchases from the App Store, iTunes, Music, and more, you must add a valid payment method to your Apple Account. To add a payment method on iOS, go to Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping, tap Add Payment Method, and add relevant payment details. You may add payment details by manually entering information or taking a picture of your payment card. If you choose to add payment details by taking a picture of your payment card, your device will pull the relevant information from the image to populate the required fields; the image will not be seen or stored by Apple. Apple collects and stores the payment method details that you provide, including account number and expiration date, to carry out your purchases, comply with law, and to prevent fraud. You may also provide Apple with a billing and shipping address, which may be used for marketing and analytics purposes, as well as to comply with law and prevent fraud.
When you use a payment card, Apple may retain and automatically update your card number and billing information for future purchases, recurring transactions, or other uses you authorize. Apple may obtain this information from your financial institution or payment network, and also use it for fraud prevention and verification.
If you have enabled Apple Pay, Apple will also check whether any Apple Pay payment methods are eligible to be added as a payment method on file to your Apple Account and display those payment methods below Found in Wallet. When you conduct a transaction with your Apple Account, Apple may also check whether any Apple Account payment methods on file are eligible for Apple Pay. If so, to help safeguard your payment information, Apple may enable Apple Pay for that payment method. You can modify your payment methods at any time by going to Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping.
You may purchase an Apple gift card using a payment method associated with your Apple Account and share the gift card with a recipient by providing Apple with their email address, your name, and the gift card amount. You may also enter a message if you so choose. Apple will use recipient information for purposes of gift card sales and redemptions, to comply with law, and to prevent fraud.
You may also redeem an Apple gift card by applying the gift card value to your Apple Account balance. When you redeem an Apple gift card, information about the gift card will be associated with your Apple Account balance and may be used by Apple to comply with law and to prevent fraud. Certain information about your gift card redemption, such as the number of gift cards that you have redeemed, may also be used to personalize your redemption experience and communications from Apple to you. You may opt out of use of gift card information for personalization by going to the iTunes Store, scrolling to the bottom, tapping Apple Account > View Apple Account and tapping to turn off Personalized Recommendations.
You may add funds directly to your Apple Account balance using your payment method on file. When you add funds to your Apple Account balance, you may have the option to set automatic amount or time intervals for recurring funds increases. When you set up automatic funds increases, you will receive communications from Apple on your device or by email concerning your balance or recurring funds increases (for example confirmation notices, receipts, and reminders once you’ve enrolled). You can update or stop the automatic funds increases at any time in your Apple Account settings.
After you redeem a gift card or add funds to your Apple Account balance, your updated Apple Account balance will be visible in Wallet so that you can easily use your Apple Account balance for Apple Store purchases.
To improve your experience with payment methods, gift cards, and adding funds to your Apple Account balance, Apple may collect certain data about your interactions, including your clicks and taps, with your Apple Account payment settings.
Subscription Management
You can view and manage your subscriptions to Apple services and third-party services purchased through Apple’s in-app purchase system in your Apple Account Settings. On iOS, go to Settings > [your name] > Subscriptions. To view the details of, manage, and cancel an active or recently active subscription, tap the subscription. You may also manage the sharing of your subscription with your family if you are in an iCloud family, as well as your Renewal Receipt preferences. When you view and manage your subscription through your Apple Account, Apple may use receipt information provided to developers at the time of your subscription purchase to request from the developer any messaging or offers that they would like Apple to display to you. Apple does not store or otherwise use for our own purposes the content of the messages that we display on the developer’s behalf, but the request for messages may indicate to the developer that you are managing your subscription, and Apple may collect information about whether and what type of message was displayed. To improve your experience with subscription management, Apple may collect data about your interactions, including what you view, click, and tap, within your Apple Account Subscription settings.
School and Business Organizations
If the email address you associate with your Apple Account uses a domain controlled by an Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager organization, Apple may share your email address with the organization after it verifies that it controls the domain. The organization may prevent your email address from being associated with your Apple Account by allowing you to transfer your account to a work or school account or by reclaiming your email address. If you choose to transfer your account, Apple may check various account characteristics to determine eligibility, such as your subscriptions and purchases, payment methods and remaining balances, and whether your account is part of a Family Sharing group. If your account is eligible, you can opt in to transfer your Apple Account to a work or school account managed by the organization, which will allow the organization to access all data associated with the account. If your account is not eligible, or you do not want to opt in, you will need to update the email address associated with your Apple Account. For more information on transferring your account, including the full list of account characteristics, and updating your email address, visit
support.apple.com/102159
.
Usage Data
We also collect data on your use of iCloud to provide and improve the quality of the service. To help address customer issues if they arise, some of this data may be associated with your Apple Account. We may use your IP address to determine the city and country from which you are accessing the service, but we do not retain it.
Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We process your Apple Account and the associated information described above generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service, and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable local law.
Where applicable law provides, we process the following categories of personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party, including information about:
Your Apple Account, including information you use to sign in, as well as all the contact, payment, and security details, such as trusted phone numbers or security questions, that you use across Apple services
The apps you install, including from where you install them (for example, a website or app marketplace)
Whether your device is eligible for certain legally required services and features based on the country or region in which it is located
Your devices, including your device’s name, serial number, and other hardware identifiers
Your use of, and subscriptions to, various Apple services, such as iCloud, the iTunes Store, the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple One
Payment details, including account numbers and expiration dates, billing and shipping addresses, and gift card redemption information
These legitimate interests include:
Providing you and others with better service and support, and for accounting, reporting, and analytics purposes
Determining the availability of and enabling legally required features and services
Using your data to send you offers via email and push notifications that may be of interest to you
Checking eligibility for offers
Preventing fraud and other malicious activity
Retention
Where you make a purchase such as a subscription, we retain personal data associated with your purchase for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting, which vary by region. For most customers, that requires at least a 10-year retention period, but in regions such as China that period can be 30 years. We may also retain a record of your interactions with iCloud-related services. These records are typically stored for 30 days but may be stored for up to three years in an aggregated form, unless we are required by law or legal process to store them for a longer period.
If you delete your Apple Account, we retain a record of the deleted account to comply with legal obligations, including as described above, and for so long as necessary for the legitimate interests of account security. If you choose to create a new account later, you will need to use an email address that is not associated with the account you have requested we delete. If you used a phone number to create your account, it cannot be used to create another account for the same reasons. You will not be able to remove the primary email address for the account or the phone number if you used it to create the account. We may also be required to retain information to comply with a court settlement or other equivalent mandated process.
Where we delete an account, we make our best efforts to delete all personal data associated with your account. If we delete your personal data, we will both render certain personal data about you permanently unrecoverable and also deidentify certain personal data.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
www.apple.com/privacy

We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings.

Right to Delete.
You have the right to request that we delete personal data that we have collected from you.
Right to Correct.
You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data that we maintain about you.
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.
We do not sell personal data to third parties in exchange for money. However, as we explain in
Section 5
, we share information with advertising partners and allow advertising partners to collect information from our Digital Properties. This exchange may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under California law, and you have the right to opt out of this “sale” or “sharing” of personal data.
California residents may request to exercise the Right to Know, the Right to Delete, and the Right to Correct by using our
webform
. We will not discriminate against you, in any manner prohibited by applicable law, for exercising these rights.
How to Fully Exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing:
In order to fully exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing with respect to any “sale” or “sharing” of information, you must undertake both of the following steps:
Submit a Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request using our
webform
; and
Disable the use of advertising cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our website footer. You must complete this step on each of our Sites from each browser and on each device that you use. These steps are necessary so that we can place a first-party cookie signaling that you have opted out on each browser and each device you use.
If you block cookies, we will be unable to comply with your Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request for device data that we automatically collect and disclose to third parties online using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. If you clear the cookies in your browser, you will need to follow Step 2 above again. To the extent required by California law, we will honor “Do Not Sell or Share” opt-out preference signals sent in a format commonly-used and recognized by businesses at the browser level, such as an HTTP header field or JavaScript object.
Verification:
To process California data protection requests, we will need to obtain information to locate you in our records or verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request. In most cases, we will request information about you, which may include your name, email address, or other information. If you submit a Right to Know “Specific Pieces Report,” we may also request a signed declaration, under penalty of perjury, that you are who you say you are.

Terms of Service
Terms of Service
Version
/legal/terms/3.0.0/
of This Agreement was created on
February 12, 2024
.
These Sentry Terms of Service (“
Agreement
”) are entered into by and between Functional Software, Inc. d/b/a Sentry (“
Sentry
” or “
we
”) and the entity or person placing an order for or accessing the Service (“
Customer
” or “
you
”). If you are accessing or using the Service on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to “you” or “Customer” in this Agreement mean your company.
If you have a separate written agreement with Sentry for your use of the Service, this Agreement will not apply to you.
This Agreement permits Customer to purchase subscriptions to the Service and other services from Sentry pursuant to Sentry ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions or order confirmations referencing this Agreement (“
Orders
”) and sets forth the basic terms and conditions under which those products and services will be delivered. This Agreement will govern Customer’s initial purchase on the Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer that reference this Agreement. Certain capitalized terms are defined in Section 20 (Definitions) and others are defined contextually in this Agreement.
The “
Effective Date
” of this Agreement is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer’s initial access to any Service through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the effective date of the first Order referencing this Agreement.
Modifications to this Agreement
: From time to time, Sentry may modify this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified by Sentry, changes become effective for Customer upon renewal of Customer’s current Subscription Term or entry into a new Order. Sentry will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the changes through communications via Customer’s account, email or other means. Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement before renewing a Subscription Term or entering into a new Order, and in any event, continued use of the Service after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer’s acceptance of such updated version. If Sentry specifies that changes to this Agreement will take effect prior to Customer’s next renewal or order (such as for legal compliance or product change reasons) and Customer objects to such changes, Customer may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the applicable Service for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.
BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES CONTAINED OR REFERENCED IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 16, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.
Overview
. Sentry offers a suite of software-as-a-service solutions designed to identify, monitor and alert Customer to problems that are occurring in a Customer Application. These Services include code coverage reporting, error monitoring, performance monitoring and other application monitoring solutions. Customer uses SDKs to bundle Service Data about the Customer Application and send that Service Data to the Service. Customer may either create its own SDKs or select from reference SDKs that Sentry makes separately available for different software languages, frameworks and libraries. Customer controls what Service Data (including what, if any, personal information) are sent to and processed by the Service by configuring SDKs and the Service. Customer may also elect to import and export Service Data between the Service and certain Third-Party Platforms (e.g., messaging services, code repositories and project management solutions) through supported integrations.
The Service
.
Permitted Use
. During the Subscription Term, Customer may access and use the Service only for its internal business purposes in accordance with any Scope of Use and the Documentation, the AUP and this Agreement.
Users
. Only Users may access or use the Service. The Service is not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 16. Customer must ensure that all its Users are over 16 years old. Each User must keep login credentials confidential and not share them with anyone else. Customer is responsible for its Users’ compliance with this Agreement and actions taken through their accounts (excluding misuse of accounts caused by Sentry’s breach of this Agreement). Customer will promptly notify Sentry if it becomes aware of any compromise of any User login credentials. Sentry uses User account information as described in its Privacy Policy, but the Privacy Policy does not apply to Service Data.
Restrictions
. Customer will not (and will not authorize anyone else to) do any of the following: (a) provide access to (except for Users), distribute, sell or sublicense the Service to a third party, (b) use the Service on behalf of, or to provide any product or service (except for Customer Applications) to, third parties, (c) use the Service to develop a similar or competing product or service, (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Service, except to the extent expressly permitted by Law (and then only with prior notice to Sentry), (e) modify or create derivative works of the Service or copy any element of the Service, (f) remove or obscure any proprietary notices in the Service, (g) publish benchmarks or performance information about the Service, (h) interfere with the Service’s operation, circumvent its access restrictions or conduct any security or vulnerability test of the Service or (i) transmit any viruses or other harmful materials to the Service.
SDKs
. In order to use the Service, Customer may be required to use SDKs to send Service Data about Customer Applications to the Service. Customer may create its own SDKs or select from reference SDKs that Sentry makes separately available in public repositories (“
Reference SDKs
”). Customer’s use of Reference SDKs is subject to the applicable license terms provided with such Reference SDKs and not the terms of this Agreement. Customer’s failure to properly implement SDKs may cause certain features of the Service to be unavailable or cease to function. The Service excludes SDKs, and Sentry shall have no warranty, support, indemnity or other obligations with respect to SDKs under this Agreement.
Support
. If Customer has purchased a paid subscription to the Service, unless otherwise specified in an Order, during the Subscription Term Sentry will provide Support through Sentry’s online support page for the relevant service, or by email at the email address for the relevant Service, currently
support@sentry.io
and
support@codecov.io
, respectively. Sentry will use reasonable efforts to respond to Support requests during business hours. For free or unpaid subscriptions to the Service, please visit our online support page for any support-related questions.
Data
.
Submission of Service Data
. Customer controls the types and amounts of Service Data (including what, if any, personal information is included) that are submitted to the Service through Customer’s configuration and use of SDKs, the Service and Third-Party Platforms. Customer is responsible for its configuration of SDKs and the Service (including any decision not to use available data scrubbing tools or other privacy or security settings or features).
Data Use
.
Service Data
. Subject to this Agreement, and solely to the extent necessary to provide, maintain and improve the Service and Support to Customer, Customer grants Sentry the non-exclusive, worldwide right, during the term of this Agreement, to access, use, process, copy, perform, store, export, transmit and display Service Data. Solely to the extent reformatting Service Data for display in the Service constitutes a modification or derivative work, the foregoing license also includes the right to modify and create derivative works of Service Data. In addition to the rights granted above, Sentry may use Non-Identifying Data for Additional Uses. Only to the extent Customer so authorizes via its configuration of the Service, Sentry may use other elements of Service Data for Additional Uses; provided, however, that Sentry will not disclose any Service Data used in this manner externally unless it has been Aggregated or Anonymized.
Usage Data
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Sentry may collect and use Usage Data to operate, improve and support the Service and for Additional Uses.  Sentry will not disclose Usage Data externally, including in benchmarks or reports, unless it has been Aggregated or Anonymized.
Security
. Sentry uses reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the Service and Service Data as described in the Security Policy.
Personal Data
. Unless Customer and Sentry have entered into a DPA, Customer will not submit any Personal Data to the Service.
Protected Health Information
. Sentry makes a BAA available for customers with subscriptions to eligible plans. Unless Customer’s then-current subscription is to an eligible plan and has entered into a BAA with Sentry, Customer will not submit any PHI to the Service.
Location
. Sentry will store Service Data in the region selected by Customer through its configuration of the Service. In addition, Sentry may process Service Data in the United States or in countries where its Affiliates and third-party sub-processors are located.
Data Export and Deletion
. During the Subscription Term, Customer may export or delete its Service Data from the Service using the export and deletion features described in the Documentation. After the Subscription Term, Sentry will delete Service Data in accordance with its standard schedule and procedures.
Customer Obligations
.
Generally
. Customer is responsible for all Service Data, including its accuracy, and agrees to comply with Laws and the Documentation in using the Service. Customer represents and warrants that it has made all disclosures and has all rights, consents and permissions necessary to use Service Data with the Service and grant Sentry the rights in Section 4.2 (Data Use), all without violating or infringing Laws, third-party rights (including intellectual property, publicity or privacy rights) or any terms or privacy policies that apply to Service Data.
No Sensitive Personal Information
. Customer must not use the Service with Sensitive Personal Information (except as permitted in accordance with Section 4.5 (Protected Health Information). Except as set forth in a BAA, Customer acknowledges that the Service is not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, including HIPAA requirements, and that Sentry is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, except for PHI submitted in accordance with Section 4.5 (Protected Health Information), Sentry has no liability for Sensitive Personal Information.
Suspension of Service
. Sentry may suspend Customer’s access to the Service and related services: (i) if Customer breaches Section 2.3 (Restrictions) or Section 5 (Customer Obligations), (ii) if Customer’s account is 30 days or more overdue, (iii) if Customer’s actions risk harm to other customers or the security, availability or integrity of the Service (including by regularly exceeding any applicable rate limits) or (iv) if Customer fails to comply with the AUP. Where practicable, Sentry will use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice of the suspension. Once Customer resolves the issue requiring suspension, Sentry will promptly restore Customer’s access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement.
Third-Party Platforms
. Certain features or functionality of the Service may require Customer to use Third-Party Platforms. Use of Third-Party Platforms is subject to Customer’s agreement with the relevant provider and not this Agreement. Sentry does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Platforms, including their security, functionality, operation, availability or interoperability or how the Third-Party Platforms or their providers use Service Data. If Customer enables a Third-Party Platform with the Service, Sentry may access and exchange Service Data with the Third-Party Platform on Customer’s behalf.
No Professional Services
. Sentry does not provide any professional, consulting, work-for-hire, custom development or similar services of any type.
Commercial Terms
.
Subscription Term
. Unless otherwise set forth on the applicable Order, each Subscription Term will automatically renew for an equivalent period unless either party gives the other party notice of non-renewal before the current Subscription Term ends (with respect to Customer, in accordance with Section 9.5 below).
Fees and Taxes
. Fees are as described in each Order. Fees are invoiced on the schedule in the Order. Unless the Order provides otherwise, all fees are due within 30 days of the invoice date.  Fees for renewal Subscription Terms are at Sentry’s then-current rates, regardless of any discounted pricing in a prior Order. Except as expressly otherwise set forth herein, all fees are non-refundable. All Fees are exclusive of any applicable sales or other taxes or similar fees imposed by any government authority. Customer will (a) pay or reimburse all such taxes and fees (including any interest or penalties), if any, due, based on or measured by amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement (excluding taxes based on Sentry’s net income) or (b) furnish Sentry with evidence acceptable to the applicable government authority to sustain an exemption therefrom. If Customer is required by Laws to deduct withholding taxes from payments to Sentry, Customer will increase the amount payable to Sentry as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings, Sentry receives and retains (free from any tax liability) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.
On Demand
. If Customer purchases a Service with on-demand usage and exceeds the applicable Scope of Use specified in the Order in a given month, Customer agrees to pay Sentry additional on-demand fees for such excess usage (“
On Demand Usage
”) monthly in arrears at the then-current price for On Demand Usage.
Payment via Credit Card
. If Customer is purchasing the Service via credit card, debit card or other payment card (”
Credit Card
”), the following terms apply:
Recurring Billing Authorization
. By providing Credit Card information and agreeing to purchase the Service, Customer hereby authorizes Sentry (or its designee) to automatically charge Customer’s Credit Card on the same date of each calendar month (or the closest prior date, if there are fewer days in a particular month) during the Subscription Term for all fees accrued as of that date (if any) in accordance with the applicable Order. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the amount billed and charged each month may vary depending on Customer’s use of the Service and may include fees for On Demand Usage for the prior month.
Foreign Transaction Fees
. Customer acknowledges that for certain Credit Cards, the issuer of Customer’s Credit Card may charge a foreign transaction fee or other charges.
Invalid Payment
. If a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration of a Credit Card, insufficient funds, or otherwise, Customer remains responsible for any amounts not remitted to Sentry and Sentry may, in its sole discretion, either (i) invoice Customer directly for the deficient amount, (ii) continue billing the Credit Card once it has been updated by Customer (if applicable) or (iii) terminate this Agreement.
Changing Credit Card Information
. At any time, Customer may change its Credit Card information by entering updated Credit Card information in its account settings.
Payment of Outstanding Fees
. Upon any termination, expiration or cancellation of a Subscription Term, Sentry will charge Customer’s Credit Card (or invoice Customer directly) for any outstanding fees for Customer’s use of the Service during the Subscription Term (including any fees for On Demand Usage), after which Sentry will not charge Customer’s Credit Card for any additional fees.
Cancellation
.
If Customer does not want to renew a subscription, Customer must cancel its account(s)/subscription(s) from its account settings.
An email or phone request to cancel Customer’s account is not considered notice of non-renewal. Any cancellation will take effect only at the end of Customer’s then-current Subscription Term, and Customer will continue to owe all fees (including, if applicable, monthly subscription fees and fees for any On Demand Usage) for the duration of the then-current Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sentry reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to permit Customer to cancel its subscription immediately without further liability by making a lump-sum payment to Sentry that is equal to the upcoming three (3) months of subscription fees that Customer would otherwise have owed Sentry.
Upgrades and Downgrades
. If Customer upgrades its plan or Scope of Use, we will immediately bill Customer for the applicable subscription fees. Downgrades will go into effect at the end of Customer’s then-current Subscription Term. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. Downgrading account(s) may cause the loss of Service Data, features, or capacity of such account(s). We do not accept any liability for such loss.
Disclaimers. The Service, Support and all related Sentry services are provided “AS IS”. Sentry and its suppliers make no other warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or noninfringement. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, Sentry does not warrant that Customer’s use of the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, that Sentry will review Service Data for accuracy or that it will maintain Service Data without loss. Sentry is not liable for delays, failures or problems inherent in use of the Internet and electronic communications or other systems outside Sentry’s control or for use of the Service in High Risk Activities. Customer may have other statutory rights, but any statutorily required warranties will be limited to the shortest legally permitted period. Sentry does not warrant that using the Service will enable Customer to identify all issues or bugs in Customer Applications or that Customer will be able to correct issues or bugs reported by the Service. Sentry makes no warranties regarding the performance of Customer Applications and, as between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for Customer Applications.

Except for Customer’s use rights in this Agreement, Sentry and its licensors retain all intellectual property and other rights in the Service and related Sentry technology, templates, formats, machine learning or large language models and dashboards, including any modifications or improvements to these items made by Sentry. If Customer provides Sentry with feedback or suggestions regarding the Service or other Sentry offerings, Sentry may use the feedback or suggestions without restriction or obligation.
Limitations of Liability
.
Consequential Damages Waiver
.
Except for Excluded Claims, neither party (nor its suppliers) will have any liability arising out of or related to this Agreement for any loss of use, lost data, lost profits, failure of security mechanisms, interruption of business or any indirect, special, incidental, reliance or consequential damages of any kind, even if informed of their possibility in advance.
Liability Cap
.
Except for Excluded Claims, each party’s (and its suppliers’) entire liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed in aggregate the amounts paid or payable by Customer to Sentry during the prior 12 months under this Agreement.
Excluded Claims
. “
Excluded Claims
” means: (a) Customer’s breach of Sections 2.3 (Restrictions) or 5 (Customer Obligations), (b) Customer’s breach of Section 15 (Confidentiality) or (c) amounts payable to third parties under the indemnifying party’s obligations in Section 14 (Indemnification).
Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose
. The waivers and limitations in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose.
Indemnification
.
Indemnification by Customer
. Customer will defend Sentry from and against any third-party claim to the extent resulting from Service Data or Customer’s breach or alleged breach of Section 5 (Customer Obligations) and will indemnify and hold harmless Sentry against any damages or costs awarded against Sentry (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in settlement by Customer resulting from the claim.
Procedures
. The indemnifying party’s obligations in this Section 14 are subject to receiving (a) prompt notice of the claim, (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement of the claim and (c) all reasonably necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at the indemnifying party’s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the indemnified party’s prior consent if settlement would require the indemnified party to admit fault or take or refrain from taking any action (other than relating to use of the Service, when Sentry is the indemnifying party). The indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.
Confidentiality
.
Definition
. “
Confidential Information
” means information disclosed to the receiving party under this Agreement that is designated by the disclosing party as proprietary or confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be proprietary or confidential due to its nature and the circumstances of its disclosure. Sentry’s Confidential Information includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any technical or performance information about the Service. Customer’s Confidential Information includes Service Data.
Obligations
. As a receiving party, each party will (a) hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, including Section 4.2 (Data Use), and (b) only use Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Sentry, the subcontractors referenced in Section 19.9), provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 15 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 15.
Exclusions
. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that the receiving party can document (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party, (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this Agreement, (c) it rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations or (d) it independently developed without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.
Remedies
. Unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone are an insufficient remedy. Each party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section 15.
Required Disclosures
. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits either party from making disclosures, including of Service Data and other Confidential Information, if required by Law, subpoena or court order, provided (if permitted by Law) it notifies the other party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.
No-Charge Products
. If Customer receives access to the Service or Service features on a no-charge, free or trial basis or as an alpha, beta or early access offering (“
No-Charge Products
”), use of such No-Charge Products is permitted only during the period designated by Sentry (or if not designated, 30 days). No-Charge Products are optional and either party may terminate No-Charge Products at any time for any reason. No-Charge Products may be inoperable, incomplete or include features that Sentry may never release, and their features and performance information are Sentry’s Confidential Information.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Sentry provides no warranty, indemnity, service levels or Support for No-Charge Products and its liability for No-Charge Products will not exceed US$50.
Publicity
. Neither party may publicly announce this Agreement except with the other party’s prior consent or as required by Laws. However, Sentry may include Customer and its trademarks in Sentry’s customer lists and promotional materials, issue a press release identifying Customer as a Sentry customer, inform other potential customers that Customer is a Sentry customer and identify Customer as a customer in other forms of publicity (including, without limitation, case studies and blog posts), but will cease such use at Customer’s written request.
General Terms
.
Assignment
. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all its assets or voting securities (each, a “
Change of Control
”). If Customer assigns this Agreement in a Change of Control permitted under this Section, Customer will update all necessary details in Customer’s account settings. Any non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns.
Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue
. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement will be the state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in connection with such action.
Notices
. Except as set out in this Agreement, any notice or consent under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given: (a) upon receipt if by personal delivery, (b) upon receipt if by certified or registered U.S. mail (return receipt requested), (c) one day after dispatch if by a commercial overnight delivery service or (d) upon delivery if by email. Either party may update its contact information with notice to the other party. Notices to Sentry must be sent to: Functional Software, Inc. dba Sentry, Attn: Legal Department, 45 Fremont Street, 8th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105-2250, USA (with a copy by email to
legal@sentry.io
). Notices to Customer will be sent to the address (if any) set forth in the Order or by email to Customer’s email set forth in the Order. Sentry may also send notices to Customer through the Service.
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement (which includes all Orders, the Policies and, if applicable, the BAA and the DPA) is the parties’ entire agreement regarding its subject matter and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements regarding its subject matter. In this Agreement, headings are for convenience only and “including” and similar terms are to be construed without limitation. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including electronic copies and PDFs), each of which is deemed an original and which together form one and the same agreement.
Amendments
. Except as otherwise provided herein, any amendments, modifications or supplements to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by each party’s authorized representatives or, as appropriate, agreed through electronic means provided by Sentry. Nonetheless, with notice to Customer, Sentry may modify the Policies to reflect new features or changing practices, but the modifications will not materially decrease Sentry’s overall obligations during a Subscription Term. The terms in any Customer purchase order or business form will not amend or modify this Agreement and are expressly rejected by Sentry; any of these Customer documents are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.
Waivers and Severability
. Waivers must be signed by the waiving party’s authorized representative and cannot be implied from conduct. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so the rest of this Agreement remains in effect.
Force Majeure
. Neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) due to events beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, pandemic, riot, Internet or utility failures, refusal of government license or natural disaster.
Subcontractors
. Sentry may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise Sentry’s rights, but Sentry remains responsible for their compliance with this Agreement and for its overall performance under this Agreement.
Independent Contractors
. The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners or joint venturers.
Export Control
. Customer agrees to comply with all relevant U.S. and foreign export and import Laws in using the Service. Customer (a) represents and warrants that it is not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country, (b) agrees not to access or use the Service in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction and (c) will not submit to the Service any information controlled under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
Government End-Users

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Controls For Do-not-track Features
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?
In Short:  Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
California Consumer Protection Act
Effective January 1, 2020, the CCPA allows California residents twice a year, upon a verifiable consumer request, to request that a business that collects consumers’ personal information to give consumers access, in a portable and (if technically feasible) readily usable form, to the specific pieces and categories of personal information that the business has collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared. California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of information under certain circumstances. Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your rights, we won’t charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information.  Please contact us as described in the “How Can You Contact Us About This Policy?” section below for information on how to submit a request. Please note that you must verify your identity and request before further action is taken. As a part of this process, government identification may be required.

In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
