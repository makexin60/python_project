Google API and OAuth Permissions [Gmail One-Click]
Post SMTP offers a Gmail One-Click Setup feature that allows users to send emails through their WordPress sites using their Google accounts. This feature uses the Google Gmail API for seamless email sending.
Use and Transfer of Google User Data:
When you activate the Gmail One-Click Setup, Post SMTP requests the following OAuth scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send
– Allows the plugin to send emails on your behalf.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
– Verifies the user’s email address during setup. (With this scope, the app can see the user’s email address and the information that the user made public).
These scopes are essential for enabling the Gmail One-Click Setup feature, and we do not request any additional permissions beyond what is necessary.
Post SMTP adheres to the
Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
Retention and Deletion of Google User Data:
Post SMTP does not store or log the content of emails sent through the plugin.
No Google user data is retained after authorization is revoked by the user.
Users can revoke Post SMTP’s access at any time via their Google account settings. Once revoked, all OAuth tokens are deleted, and access to your Google account is permanently terminated.
