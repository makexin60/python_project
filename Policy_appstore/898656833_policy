Last Updated: December 22, 2022
The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We use physical, technical, and administrative measures to secure your information including personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We have certain policies and procedures in place such that we never transfer particular types of sensitive information.  It should be noted that while Zolo takes the security of your information seriously, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality and privacy of the Internet.
The Online Security and Privacy Policy applies to Questrade Financial Group Inc. and all its subsidiaries which includes Zolo Ventures Ltd. (and its subsidiaries), Questrade, Inc., Questrade Wealth Management Inc., QuestEnterprise Inc., QuestGlobal Inc., Community Trust Company, and Think!nsure Ltd. In addition, QuestMortgage® is a service provided under license by Community Trust Company, and is a trademark of Questrade, Inc. All of the foregoing entities are collectively referred to as the “

Zolo uses various security controls at different levels, which include the latest online and networking security technology to ensure that your interaction with Zolo is safe and secure. Some of our security features include:
Firewalls
Firewalls are designed to securely separate the Internet from our internal computer systems and databases.
Traffic coming from customer computers passes through a series of safety checkpoints that inspect and block unauthorized traffic before being accepted to our internal system; as such, only authorized traffic can enter our system.
The firewalls also inspect and restrict the traffic from leaving our systems to the Internet.
Encryption
Encryption is a means of scrambling information for transmission, in this case, between your personal computer and Zolo's network. Information that is encrypted at one end is decrypted (decoded) upon receipt at the other. Zolo uses industry best practices for encryption of your information.
To protect your privacy and account information, we use digital certificates in order to assure you that you are communicating directly with Zolo. When you login to your account, your browser challenges the Zolo website to prove its identity using digital certificates. Your browser can verify the certificate and will alert you if the website is not Zolo.
