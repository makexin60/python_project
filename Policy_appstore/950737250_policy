"Excellent training and software implementation"
We have found the product and the company second to none. It was extremely easy to
implement and any issues we had with it were sorted immediately. The company bent over
backwards to solve any hiccups we had or anything we needed tweaked or changed. We had
excellent training on a weekly basis until we were happy to push forward by ourselves.
We are so glad we picked this software.
