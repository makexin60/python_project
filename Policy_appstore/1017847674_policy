This policy does not apply to our education users. If you are an education customer, please see our Education Privacy Policy at
edu.sphero.com/child-policy
.
As a company focused on inspiring the creators of tomorrow, we are passionate about protecting your privacy. We have divided this policy into two parts; we start with a general overview of the key points and then provide more details on those concepts later in the policy. Our policy works in tandem with our
Terms of Use
, which we recommend you read as well.
Overview
We limit the information we collect from those using our products and give parents control over their children’s information. If you have questions, please email
support@sphero.com
or Sphero’s Data Protection Officer at
dpo@sphero.com.

We collect information about you—such as your name, login details, and contact information—to provide our service, personalize it for you, and contact you in connection with your product or our service. Sometimes we collect data from our products, such as when they crash, in order to improve the product for you. We also collect information on how people interact with our site to help us improve the user experience and provide more relevant advertising. For our users outside the United States, we also want to flag for you that we may need to transfer your data back to the United States—which is where we are based.

We believe in your privacy and keeping your data secure. So we have adopted measures to help us safeguard your information. For example, we put security measures in place to prevent our robots from being used in nefarious ways. Find or suspect a vulnerability in our system? Let us know at
security@sphero.com.
Learn more about our security >
We don’t disclose your data often, but sometimes we provide it to (1) our vendors who help us make our website or products work better, (2) companies who help us tailor advertising to your interests, and (3) others in limited situations described below (such as when the law requires it).
Learn more about when we disclose data >
We make sure you have control over your data and how we use it. If you don’t want to get messages from us or want to close an account, you can do so at any time. Plus, if you want to delete your in-app data from our systems, just email our team at
support@sphero.com
and we’ll take care of it (though we may still retain copies of your records in our routine backups).

2. Uses
We generally use your information to:
Provide our Services

For example, we may use it to maintain your account, fulfill your orders, respond to your comments, provide requested support, and improve our services by understanding what you like (or don’t like).
Operate our Products.
Our products are interactive, and we are always working to improve our products and make sure everything works. For example, we may process user data to help you control the product, understand engagement with it, and personalize the content when you use it (such as greeting you by username or showing you age-appropriate content).
Improve our Offerings.
We are always working to improve our Site and want to keep visitors informed about our offerings. For example, we may use your data to help us understand and improve our Site’s design and our Services’ functionality.
Communicate with You.
We use your contact information for promotional marketing if you have purchased a product or agreed to receive such emails. For example, when you provide us contact information, we may send you newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to our Services.
Provide Relevant Advertisements.
We, and certain third parties operating on or through our Site, may collect your information in order to provide you more relevant advertising on our Site and elsewhere on the internet. You can find more information our practices below in the Cookies and Similar Technologies section.
With your consent, we may also use your Personal Data for other reasons. We do not use your sensitive Personal Data for any reasons not permitted by California Civil Code section 1798.121(a) and the related regulations.
For our European customers, the law in Europe—the GDPR and similar United Kingdom legislation—requires we also tell you our legal bases for processing your information. We generally process your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests. These interests include: direct marketing, personalizing and providing the Services, evaluating marketing campaigns, securing and protecting our Services, looking into suspicious activity, investigating violations of our policies or Terms of Use, and preventing harm to you or others. But we rely on (1) legal necessity when we use your information to comply with legal obligations or (2) your consent when using non-essential cookies, transferring Personal Data to the United States, and engaging in other activities not addressed elsewhere in this policy.
3. Cookies and Similar Technologies
To make our Services more useful to you, we and our trusted partners may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies (collectively “Cookies”) to process Personal Data when you interact with our Site. Generally, we use Cookies to ensure our Site functions properly, gather analytics that helps us improve the Site, and provide you with relevant advertising. You can find more details on our use of Cookies by visiting our Cookie Policy
here
.
If we determine you are visiting our Site from Europe, we will seek your consent before using any non-essential Cookies. For our other users, you can opt out of certain Cookies by following the instructions in our Cookie Policy, exercising the rights described below, changing your browser’s settings, or visiting
www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
or
www.aboutads.info/choices
.
Please note, at this time, our Site does not respond to your browser’s do-not-track request or similar signals.
4. Disclosures & Transfers
In the last 12 months, we have not disclosed your Personal Data to third parties, as that term is defined in applicable privacy laws. We may, however, disclose your information to the following recipients:
Vendors.
We provide information to vendors we rely on to provide us certain services or process data on our behalf. Our vendors can only use the data pursuant to our instructions, and they are contractually bound to adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Policy
Affiliates.
We provide information to our affiliates to help us streamline our operations, develop products, communicate with our customers, and carry out similar business functions.
Marketers.
We provide information to marketing companies to help us deliver relevant advertisements.
We may also disclose information to others: to comply with the law or court orders, in connection with appropriate investigations, as needed to protect our legal interests (such as advancing or defending claims), and in connection with a corporate reorganization (such as a merger or acquisition). It is possible that we will make these disclosures to recipients in locations that do not ensure the same degree of protection of your Personal Data as your home jurisdiction.
We do not give your information to third parties in exchange for money.
As discussed more above, however, we allow trusted partners to collect some of your data so they can provide you targeted advertising based on your interactions with us and others online. Some states may consider this practice as us “selling” or “sharing” your information. In the last 12 months, we allowed companies to collect the following categories of personal data for targeted advertising: Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information. We do not have actual knowledge that we allowed those companies to collect
information on anyone who is younger than 16 years old.
We are based in the United States. So, if you create or use an account in another country, you consent to your data being processed in and transferred to the United States.
5. Your Rights and Choices
You have the following rights concerning your Personal Data:
Access
. You can request that we provide you access to the Personal Data we have about you. Specifically, you can ask us to give you: the specific pieces of Personal Data we collected, the categories of that data we collected, the source of that data, our purpose for collecting it (and selling or sharing it, if applicable), the categories of data we disclosed to a third party for a business purpose (along with the categories of recipients), and the categories of data we sold or shared (along with the categories of recipients). You can also request that we provide you a copy of your Personal Data in a common, portable format.
Correct.
You can request that we correct Personal Data we hold about you. You may be able to make changes to much of the information you provided via your account settings menu.
Delete.

Object.
For our European customers, you can object to our processing of your Personal Data when we do so based on our legitimate interests.
Opt-Out of Sales & Sharing.
You can ask us to not sell or share your Personal Data. [As a reminder, the only “sale” or “sharing” we do is allowing our trusted partners to collect your information to deliver you more targeted advertising.] You can make this choice yourself by using our Cookie management function on our website.
Complain.
You have the right to contact or file a complaint with regulators or supervisory authorities about our processing of Personal Data. To do so, please contact your local data protection or other applicable regulator.

Welcome to hCaptcha! This Privacy Policy describes the practices of Intuition Machines, Inc. ("IMI", "we" or "us") regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of information (including Personal Information, defined below) through our website at www.hcaptcha.com and any other subdomains or domains we use (the "Sites") and the hCaptcha application program interface and related software and materials (collectively, the "Service").

Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Sites and Service you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.
‍
A Note to California Residents
. Please see our "Notice to California Residents" section related to your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). At or before the time of collection, California residents may have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the categories of Personal Information to be collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is sold or shared, and how long such information is retained. You can find those details within this Privacy Policy.
‍
A Note to European Economic Area Residents.
Please see our "Notice to EU Data Subjects" section related to your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and our Data Privacy Framework notice below.
Note that IMI is the controller of your personal information, except where we process personal information on behalf of our Integrators in connection with the provision of our Service, in which case we are the processor/service provider of personal information, and those Integrators are the controllers/businesses of the personal information.
‍
Where we act as a processor/service provider for our Integrators, we do not use the personal information collected for any purpose other than as reasonably necessary to provide our Service, and our processing will be governed by the contracts that we have in place with our Integrators, not this Privacy Policy
.
If a contract we have with an Integrator refers to, or incorporates by reference, this Privacy Policy, any personal information we process on behalf of the Integrator will be subject to the Data Processing Addendum, not this Privacy Policy.
In some cases, we may license our software to Integrators and/or operate it within their environment on their behalf, in which case we are solely a licensor of software and only their terms and privacy policy shall apply to such personal data.
We may reference or describe some personal data collected from End-Users throughout this Privacy Policy. However, these disclosures are for informational purposes only and, for clarity, the processing of End-User personal data is governed by the agreement we have with our Integrator customers, not this Privacy Policy.
Processing of EU Data Subject data operates under the legal basis of the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) integrated within the Data Processing Addendum to our Terms of Service or Data Processing Agreements with our Integrators.
If you have any questions or concerns about how such data is handled or would like to exercise your rights, you should contact the person or entity (i.e., the data controller) who has contracted with us to use the Service to process this data. We will, however, provide assistance to our Integrators to address any concerns you may have, in accordance with the terms of our contract with them.

We collect the following categories of information:
Information that can be used to identify or contact an individual ("Personal Information"), such as name, email address, and country. We collect Personal Information from our current and prospective Integrators and Customers when they give it directly to us (for example, by filling in a form when signing up for an account, or applying to receive email notifications from us). We may also verify the identity of our Integrators and Customers by comparing personal information against third party databases or official legal documents.
Information collected automatically as a result of an Integrator’s or Customer’s use of the Sites or the Services ("Analytics Information"), such as IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp of access, and other similar information. Some Analytics Information is collected on our behalf by third parties we engage for that purpose, and some Analytics Information is collected through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies (see "Third Party Analytics and Tracking Technologies" below).
Information collected as a result of End-Users answering prompts through the Service ("Labeled Data"), such as image labeling data, text converted from audio files played to those End-Users, answers to questions, and other prompts generated by the Service for purposes of labeling data for use in machine learning applications. Note that Labeled Data is not tied to any identified individual.
Other information collected from End-Users as part of the Service to that is required to determine whether they
are human, such as mouse movements, scroll position, keypress events, touch events, and similar information as applicable.
We may collect additional information from End-Users who wish to work with us as Individual Data Labelers.
How We Use Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
To administer Integrator and Customer accounts and provide the Service. We use Personal Information in order to associate specific accounts with  Integrators and Customers and to provide them the Service, to respond to requests or inquiries, to provide support or technical assistance, and to facilitate payments.
To improve to Site and the Service. We use Analytics Information to improve our existing and develop new services and offerings and to customize existing and future product offerings.
To derive market insights. We use Analytics Information to analyze the market and conduct business analyses related to the Site and our Services, and for other research purposes.
To provide a market for Labeled Data. Our Service enables high volume data labeling and human review for machine learning systems as a service to website owners and companies who need help getting their data labeled. To that end, we disclose Labeled Data to our Customers interested in acquiring Labeled Data.
To secure our services and systems. We use Analytics Information to secure our systems by identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, and to otherwise protect the information we collect.
For any legitimate business purpose, provided that the information is de-identified or aggregated such that it cannot be reasonably tied to an individual.
How We Share Information
We share or disclose personal information in the following cases:
Upon direct request from an Integrator to identify the fraud risk of a specific CAPTCHA challenge request or IP address, or otherwise where specific consent was given.
With vendors we engage to provide essential aspects of the Sites and the Service, such as data storage, hosting, and Analytics, and only for those purposes.
As necessary to comply with applicable law, including governmental requests, law enforcement requests, and otherwise to public and private entities in order to protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of you, us, or others.
With others for any legitimate business purpose, provided the information is de-identified
or aggregated such that it cannot be reasonably tied to an individual.
