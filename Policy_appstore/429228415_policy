1. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT
The Globe collects personal information from you in several ways. For example, we collect information that you provide to us, through your use of the Services, as well as information collected from publicly available sources or third parties.
INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE
When you subscribe, register, or otherwise interact with our services, you may be asked to provide certain personal information.
For example, when you register or inquire about our services, you will be asked for your contact information. For paid Services, we will require payment information such as your credit card information. For services that have age restrictions, such as age-restricted content or events, your date of birth may be required to access those services. You may choose to provide supplementary information about yourself when you register for our services, such as your birth date, gender, income range, interests, the industry you work in, current position, and other demographic information. We collect personal information that you provide when you participate in discussions using our comment feature, engage with us on social media, post an online ad, enter a contest, participate in a promotion, use our event space, or use our tools, such as when you create an investment watchlist through The Globe’s portfolio tool.
INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES
As you use our services, we collect usage information such as the pages you view, product and service preferences, purchase history, and other customer engagement information. Some information is collected automatically when you visit our websites or apps through the use of cookies and similar technologies; to learn about the types of automated information we collect and how we use it, see “

INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES OR THIRD PARTIES
The Globe may receive personal information about you from third-party sources, as permitted by law, such as marketing and data analytics databases. Third-party sources provide us with survey data and publicly available data that may include information such as your name, mailing address, phone number, contact information, other demographics, and interests to help us understand our audience and ensure our content and services are relevant. In some cases, the advertisers that serve ads on our Services will share a hashed version of your e-mail or other information with us so that we can make sure their advertisements or offers reach you. When you register for our services using a third-party platform (e.g. using your Google or Apple account), the third-party platform may provide us with your social media identifier or handle and any additional information you authorize that third-party platform to share, such as your email address or contact information.
Other people may provide us with your personal information, for example, if they provide you with a gift subscription or if they want you to have access to a corporate or educational group subscription.

3. INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED WHEN YOU VISIT OUR SITES AND APPS
We collect certain information automatically when you visit our websites, using cookies and other similar technologies, such as: your IP address, usage information such as page requests, browser type, and operating system. When you use our mobile app we collect your device hardware type and operating system, unique device identiﬁer, IP address, language settings, and the date and time the app accesses our servers. We may collect and analyze information about your use of our sites and apps, such as the pages most read, app features used, time and duration of use, search terms, and other information about your interaction with the Services.

We will obtain your express opt-in consent prior to using your precise location data for analytics, personalized ads, and personalized services.
Advertising:
We collect and use automated information to offer relevant advertising on our site and across the Internet on behalf of ourselves and advertisers.

Some advertising is based on your activity on our site, as well as your activity across different sites on the Internet known as interest-based advertising (sometimes also referred to as personalized or online behavioural advertising). Please see
Interest-Based Advertising
for information on how to opt out of interest-based advertising.

For those sites or apps, you can access the opt-out tool at any time through the ‘Privacy Settings’ link at the bottom of the applicable site.
5. INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING
The Globe may deliver tailored advertising on and off our Services based on your activity across different sites on the Internet and apps known as interest-based advertising (also referred to as personalized or online behavioural advertising). To learn more on how to opt out of interest-based advertising see “
Opting-Out of Interest-Based Advertising
”.
The Globe and third-party advertising companies, such as ad networks, may use cookies, pixels, SDKs, and other technologies to collect information about your activity on our sites or apps and on third-party sites and apps (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content, and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on our sites and apps, third-party sites, and across your devices. This information may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.
The Globe is a participant of the Digital Advertising Alliance Canada's (DAAC) AdChoices program and adheres to its principles that promote providing notice and choice to consumers about the use of their data for interest-based advertising. For more information on this program and the privacy choices it offers, see
https://youradchoices.ca/
.
OPTING-OUT OF INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
Web and Mobile Browser:
When accessing The Globe and Mail using your desktop or mobile browser, you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on the site by using our opt-out tool.  You can access the tool by clicking on the ‘Privacy Settings’ link at the bottom of the site.
You may also see the AdChoices icon in or around advertisements on a website of The Globe. These advertisements are tailored for you through interest-based advertising. You can opt out of targeted advertising from that advertiser by clicking the "AdChoices" logo within the ad.
Mobile App:
You can opt out of interest-based advertising on your mobile app through your mobile device settings, which vary by device. More information on how to do this can be found here:
https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices
. DAAC also provides a tool called AppChoices to help you opt-out that can be downloaded here:
https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools/
.
Other:
You can also generally opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising or who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) by visiting the opt-out pages on the
DAAC website
and the
NAI website
.
IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT YOUR OPT-OUTS
If you opt-out of interest-based advertising by us or a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us across the Internet, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.
Because your opt-out choice is managed by cookies or through your device settings, if you delete or clear your browser’s cookies or use a different browser or device, you will have to make your selection again.

1. About this policy
Top
“
PressReader”
or “
We
” means PressReader Inc. or PressReader International Limited, depending on where you are located. For more information, please visit:
Countries
We are the data controller. We know your privacy is important to you.  It’s important to us, too. So this Privacy Policy will help you, as a user of the Services, understand what information we may gather about you, how we use it, and how we work to protect it.  This Privacy Policy forms part of the
Terms of Use
that govern your use of the Services.
Defined terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms of Use. In visiting the Websites, downloading the App or otherwise using the Services, you are agreeing to the information practices outlined in this Privacy Policy, and to the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Each time you use the Services, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply and we encourage you to review it from time to time for updates.
Basically, if you’re using PressReader, you agree to this Privacy Policy.   If you don’t agree (but we hope you will), don’t use PressReader, and
delete your account
.
2. Information covered by this policy
Top
This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information.  “
Personal Information
” is personally identifiable information that can be used to contact you or determine your identity.  When other information is linked to this personally identifiable information, it may also become Personal Information.
Depending on the privacy laws where you live, Personal Information may include your name, personal email address, phone number, billing information, shipping address, device ID or IP address, or account login credentials, such as your login for sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google, or other third party websites or apps (your “
Social Logins
”).
This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that you provide to us, or Personal Information provided to us on your behalf by a third party, including through a Social Login. For example, you may use login details from Facebook, Google, or Twitter in order to register with PressReader. Where your registration is paid for by one of PressReader’s business or institutional customers, you may also need to provide your login details with that business or institution (for example, a library card details for access through a public library).
We want to be clear: unless we or a third party tells you otherwise, we won’t ask a third party to hand over your Personal Information in order for us to provide you with the Services.  This Privacy Policy does
not
apply to the practices of those third parties with respect to how they collect or use Personal Information in the course of their own business. Also, this Privacy Policy does not cover the processing of Personal Information by advertisers and their service providers in connection with any advertisements from third parties you may see while using our Services, including any advertisements which may be integrated into the display of the PressReader Services, nor does it cover content in the Services that links to third party websites. You’ll have to check with them to find their privacy policy.
We might have your Personal Information because the PressReader Services host content licensed to PressReader by its publishers or copyright holders which may contain your Personal Information due to the events in which it’s referenced are of public relevance, as a result of the public notoriety of your Personal Information or because of circumstances that occur in events of public interest in which you’re the protagonist. According to the applicable law, the processing of your Personal Information might not require your consent and the exercise of your Data Subject Rights might be limited to allow freedom of expression in a democratic society.
3. It’s all about you
Top
Readers are at the centre of every decision we make at PressReader. We collect, use, share and process your Personal Information, we promise it’s only to provide access to the content you want and to make your PressReader experience even better. By “better” we mean, customized to you – we want to recommend stories and content we think you’ll love, and allow you to save and share the ones you do.
If you want to get technical about it, there are a number of reasons we collect and use your Personal Information.  For example, we do so in order to deliver the Services to you as required by the Terms of Use, including providing customer support to you when you need it.  We also use it to comply with our contractual obligations to our publishing partners, to help our product development team build a better PressReader product that better reflects your interests and to advertise our services to you and users sharing your characteristics on other sites and apps.
4. Some Personal Information is required to access certain features or Services
Top
Certain features or Services will only be available to you if you create a Registered Account.  When you create a Registered Account, we ask you for basic registration information, including your name and email address or Social Login through Facebook, Twitter, or Google.  This is the minimum information you will need to provide in order to create a Registered Account.   You will be required to create a Registered Account to fully use and enjoy the features associated with a Trial, Subscription, Single Issue Purchase, or Gifted Issue.
If you purchase a Subscription or make a Single Issue Purchase, we will also collect billing information such as your credit card number, expiry date, and billing address. We may also use payment processors in order to facilitate your payment. At PressReader, your credit or debit card information is stored securely, and encrypted appropriately.
Sponsored Access may not necessarily require you to create a Registered Account.
5. We might ask for more Personal Information
Top
We may ask you to volunteer additional Personal Information at other times, such as when you register we invite you to express your interests in categories of publication so that we can present publications likely to be of your interest, or when you provide opinions, post a Submission, enter a contest or promotion, or report a problem with the Services. You can choose not to provide us with this additional Personal Information, but it may mean that you cannot take advantage of the features, Services, contests or promotions associated with our request.
6. We automatically collect certain information
Top
When you submit a request for support or information, PressReader will keep a record of that support or information request, and the manner in which it was handled by us.
We also collect information about you as a user so we can make your experience more personal. We automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, your computer or device’s name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, mobile device IDs, location information derived from GPS or similar features on your mobile device (where you have enabled such features and where you have given us permission to collect this information), date/time stamp, and other generally-accepted log information. We also record page views (hit counts), and capture information about your reading behavior.
We also use aggregated data of users in order to improve the Websites, the App, and the Services, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, to inform publishers as to what content is appealing to certain users of the Services, to inform advertisers of the usage habits or characteristics of certain users of the Services, to advise potential investors so that they may better understand PressReader’s user base; and to provide you with an improved experience when using the Websites, the App, and the Services. Some of this data is anonymised and does not therefore constitute personal data.
We use third-party technology providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Site. This includes Google Analytics - for more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page:
http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
.
7. Cookies (not the chocolate chip kind)
Top
A cookie is a small amount of data which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  Each website can send its own cookies to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it. However, to protect your privacy, most browsers only permit a website to access the cookies that the same website has already sent to you,
not
the cookies sent to you by other sites.
PressReader sets and accesses our own cookies on your computer and uses pixels, APIs and similar technologies on its site and app.  We use them to identify you as a repeat visitor, to maintain session information for logged-in users, to present personalised content recommendations based on your stated preferences, for user authentication (for instance allowing you to register and logon using your Facebook, Google and other third party platform credentials) and security and to track usage trends and patterns. That helps us better understand and improve areas of the Websites.
We also allow third party advertiser partners to use cookies and other tracking technologies in connection with “Tailored Advertising” which associates a user’s activity and interest information, demographic information, geographic information, and similar information with a browser cookie or other online identifier in order to provide more useful and relevant advertising on other sites and platforms)  We use third-party services to advertise our Services to you after you visit our site or app. We and our third-party vendors use cookies and other online tracking technologies on our site or app to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant Tailored Advertising and/or other content to you and others on our Services and in third-party services or third-party digital properties after you have left our Services. In addition to the use of such online tracking technologies, we may also upload customer lists (including encrypted email addresses) to third-party service providers, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Google, to have ads shown to users (or users with similar interests or characteristics to our users) who have visited our Site.

8. When we disclose Personal Information
Top
We share your Personal Information with certain service providers and partners to help us deliver, personalise or improve the Services, help with the security of our Services and with advertising our Services on other sites or platforms. Examples of sharing include:
When PressReader employs other third parties to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending mail, processing credit card payments, processing currency conversions, or other functions necessary to our business;
If publishers of the Publications request additional Personal Information from us. The information practices of those publishers will be governed by their own privacy policies;
If we believe you are harming or interfering with the enjoyment of the Services of other PressReader users, anyone else, or violating the terms of your Subscription, Trial, Sponsored Access or Gifted Issue, or violating the Terms of Use, or if we believe you are infringing any of PressReader or a third party’s legal rights;
If we are required by applicable law (or court order) to provide any of your Personal Information or if in our reasonable opinion it is appropriate to do so to lawful authorities in connection with their investigations. We will, if permitted by applicable law or the terms of a court order, attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied when creating your Registered Account before we respond to the request;
In the event of a sale of all or most of PressReader’s assets, this information may be transferred to the purchaser so they may continue to provide the Services to you.
We share Personal Information with certain technical service providers and partners.

The TL;DR version?  If you have any complaints or concerns about your Personal Information or how PressReader uses it, just hit us up at
dataprotection@pressreader.com
.  We’re here for you.
PressReader Inc. is governed by the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia (https://www.oipc.bc.ca/). PressReader International Limited is governed by the Irish Data Protection Commission (https://www.dataprotection.ie). If you are located outside of Canada or Ireland, you have a right to make a complaint to your applicable data protection authority.
11. How long do we keep your Personal Information For?
Top
We don't want to hold on to any of your Personal Information for longer than we need to. We delete your Personal Information as soon as we no longer require it to provide you with our Services, unless there is a legal obligation we are subject to which requires us to hold onto it. For instance, we delete your account information two years after you close your account. If you opt-out of marketing from us, we may keep a record of your opt-out for longer so that we can demonstrate we respect your preferences.
12. Privacy Notice for California Residents
Top
If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. To learn more about your rights under the act, please visit
https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038010812
.
13. For our UK and EU Users
Top
As we've mentioned already, we will collect your Personal Information if you use our Website, App and/ or receive our Services. We always ensure we have a "lawful basis" under GDPR for having your Personal Information. "Lawful basis" means we have a good reason recognised by GDPR for having your Personal Information and using it as we explain in this Policy. Some reasons for this use of your Personal Information are:
For the purposes of our contract with you – to enable us to provide you with our Services in accordance with the contact between us;
In our "legitimate interests" (as GDPR describes it) to continually learn and improve (we balance this with your rights); and
In our "legitimate interests" to manage our business and Website and App (we balance this with your rights).
We will also process your Personal Information to fulfil our contractual obligations with our publishing partners.
14. Taking security seriously
Top
PressReader uses reasonable and up-to-date security methods to prevent unauthorized access to Personal Information. Seriously. We work hard to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure correct use of Personal Information.
Your Personal Information will be stored within a database behind a firewall for added security. The server that houses the database is physically protected at a secure site and is monitored by security personnel twenty-four hours a day.  Only authorized personnel can access the site and the particular server housing the database.
No data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure.  So, while we try to protect your Personal Information, we can’t ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  We encrypt all information and web sessions within the Services that are required to be encrypted, such as transmission of credit card information to the Websites or the App, to help protect the data.
15. Watch the Kids
Top
The Services offered by PressReader are not directed to children (persons under the age of 16) and we do not knowingly collect, either online or offline, Personal Information of children under the age of 16, except where a parent or guardian has authorized its collection.  If you believe the Personal Information of a child under the age of 16 has been provided to us without parental or guardian consent, please notify us at
https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
.
16. Spam
Top
We don’t want to spam you, but we do periodically send emails to users with Registered Accounts that we think are helpful. They might talk about changes to the features of the Services, the addition of new issues of your favorite Publications, promotions, or other fun stuff.  You can always opt out of PressReader’s marketing or promotional messaging by adjusting the settings in your Registered Account.  Sorry, but you can’t opt out of billing, legal, or account-related emails.
17. Ch-ch-changes (to this Privacy Policy)
Top
We might change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we do make changes regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information, we will post a super-obvious notice of the new-and-improved Privacy Policy on the Websites (you might get an email from us, too).  Your continued use of the Services after we’ve posted notice of any change to this Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of those changes.
