Mode and place of processing the Data
Methods of processing
The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
                  unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
                  destruction of the Data.
The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT
                  enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes
                  strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the
                  Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain
                  types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of
                  this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal,
                  system administration) or external parties (such as
                  third-party technical service providers, mail carriers,
                  hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies)
                  appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The
                  updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner
                  at any time.
Legal basis of processing
The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one
                  of the following applies:
Users have given their consent for one or more specific
                    purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
                    allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                    such processing ("opt-out"), without having to rely on
                    consent or any other of the following legal bases. This,
                    however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal
                    Data is subject to European data protection law;
provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
                    agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                    obligations thereof;
processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
                    obligation to which the Owner is subject;
processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                    public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                    vested in the Owner;
processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                    interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the
                  specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
                  particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a
                  statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
                  necessary to enter into a contract.
Place
The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in
                  any other places where the parties involved in the processing
                  are located.
Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
                  transferring the User's Data to a country other than their
                  own. To find out more about the place of processing of such
                  transferred Data, Users can check the section containing
                  details about the processing of Personal Data.
Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
                  transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
                  international organization governed by public international
                  law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and
                  about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard
                  their Data.
If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by
                  checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire
                  with the Owner using the information provided in the contact
                  section.
Retention time
Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
                  required by the purpose they have been collected for.
Therefore:
Personal Data collected for purposes related to the
                    performance of a contract between the Owner and the User
                    shall be retained until such contract has been fully
                    performed.
Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner's
                    legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
                    fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
                    regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner
                    within the relevant sections of this document or by
                    contacting the Owner.
The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
                  period whenever the User has given consent to such processing,
                  as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the
                  Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer
                  period whenever required to do so for the performance of a
                  legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be
                  deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure,
                  the right to rectification and the right to data portability
                  cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
The purposes of processing
The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner
                  to provide its Services, as well as for the following
                  purposes: Beta Testing and Infrastructure monitoring, Hosting
                  and backend, Analytics, Ads and In-App purchases.
Users can find further detailed information about such
                  purposes of processing and about the specific Personal Data
                  used for each purpose in the respective sections of this
                  document.

                  related to their particular situation to justify the
                  objection.

                  justification. To learn, whether the Owner is processing

Art und Ort der Datenverarbeitung
Verarbeitungsmethoden
Der Anbieter verarbeitet die Nutzerdaten auf
                  ordnungsgemäße Weise und ergreift angemessene
                  Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, um den unbefugten Zugriff und die
                  unbefugte Weiterleitung, Veränderung oder Vernichtung von
                  Daten zu vermeiden.
Die Datenverarbeitung wird mittels Computern oder IT-basierten
                  Systemen nach organisatorischen Verfahren und Verfahrensweisen
                  durchgeführt, die gezielt auf die angegebenen Zwecke
                  abstellen. Zusätzlich zum Verantwortlichen könnten
                  auch andere Personen intern (Personalverwaltung, Vertrieb,
                  Marketing, Rechtsabteilung, Systemadministratoren) oder extern
                  - und in dem Fall soweit erforderlich, vom Verantwortlichen
                  als Auftragsverarbeiter benannt (wie Anbieter technischer
                  Dienstleistungen, Zustellunternehmen, Hosting-Anbieter,
                  IT-Unternehmen oder Kommunikationsagenturen) - diese Anwendung
                  betreiben und damit Zugriff auf die Daten haben. Eine aktuelle
                  Liste dieser Beteiligten kann jederzeit vom Anbieter verlangt
                  werden.
Rechtsgrundlagen der Verarbeitung
Der Anbieter darf personenbezogene Daten von Nutzern nur dann
                  verarbeiten, wenn einer der folgenden Punkte zutrifft:
Die Nutzer haben ihre Einwilligung für einen oder
                    mehrere bestimmte Zwecke erteilt. Hinweis: In einigen
                    Gesetzgebungen kann es dem Anbieter gestattet sein,
                    personenbezogene Daten zu verarbeiten, bis der Nutzer einer
                    solchen Verarbeitung widerspricht ("Opt-out"), ohne sich auf
                    die Einwilligung oder eine andere der folgenden
                    Rechtsgrundlagen verlassen zu müssen. Dies gilt jedoch
                    nicht, wenn die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten dem
                    europäischen Datenschutzrecht unterliegt;
die Datenerhebung ist für die Erfüllung eines
                    Vertrages mit dem Nutzer und/oder für vorvertragliche
                    Maßnahmen daraus erforderlich;
die Verarbeitung ist für die Erfüllung einer
                    rechtlichen Verpflichtung, der der Anbieter unterliegt,
                    erforderlich;
die Verarbeitung steht im Zusammenhang mit einer Aufgabe,
                    die im öffentlichen Interesse oder in Ausübung
                    hoheitlicher Befugnisse, die dem Anbieter übertragen
                    wurden, durchgeführt wird;
die Verarbeitung ist zur Wahrung der berechtigten Interessen
                    des Anbieters oder eines Dritten erforderlich.
In jedem Fall erteilt der Anbieter gerne Auskunft über
                  die konkrete Rechtsgrundlage, auf der die Verarbeitung beruht,
                  insbesondere darüber, ob die Angabe personenbezogener
                  Daten eine gesetzliche oder vertragliche Verpflichtung oder
                  eine Voraussetzung für den Abschluss eines Vertrages ist.
Ort
Die Daten werden in der Niederlassung des Anbieters und an
                  allen anderen Orten, an denen sich die an der

Je nach Standort der Nutzer können
                  Datenübertragungen die Übertragung der Daten des
                  Nutzers in ein anderes Land als das eigene beinhalten. Um mehr
                  über den Ort der Verarbeitung der übermittelten
                  Daten zu erfahren, können die Nutzer den Abschnitt mit
                  den ausführlichen Angaben zur Verarbeitung der
                  personenbezogenen Daten konsultieren.
Die Nutzer haben auch das Recht, sich über die
                  Rechtsgrundlage der Datenübermittlung in ein Land
                  außerhalb der Europäischen Union oder an eine
                  internationale Organisation, die dem Völkerrecht
                  unterliegt oder von zwei oder mehr Ländern gegründet
                  wurde, wie beispielsweise die UNO, sowie sich über die
                  vom Anbieter ergriffenen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zum Schutz
                  ihrer Daten aufklären zu lassen.
Wenn eine solche Übermittlung stattfindet, kann der
                  Nutzer mehr darüber erfahren, indem er die entsprechenden
                  Abschnitte dieses Dokuments überprüft oder sich mit
                  dem Anbieter über die im Kontaktteil angegebenen
                  Informationen in Verbindung setzt.
Speicherdauer
Personenbezogene Daten werden so lange verarbeitet und
                  gespeichert, wie es der Zweck erfordert, zu dem sie erhoben
                  wurden.
Daher gilt:
Personenbezogene Daten, die zu Zwecken der Erfüllung
                    eines zwischen dem Anbieter und dem Nutzer geschlossenen
                    Vertrages erhoben werden, werden bis zur vollständigen
                    Erfüllung dieses Vertrages gespeichert.
Personenbezogene Daten, die zur Wahrung der berechtigten
                    Interessen des Anbieters erhoben werden, werden so lange
                    aufbewahrt, wie es zur Erfüllung dieser Zwecke
                    erforderlich ist. Nutzer können nähere
                    Informationen über die berechtigten Interessen des
                    Anbieters in den entsprechenden Abschnitten dieses Dokuments
                    oder durch Kontaktaufnahme zum Anbieter erhalten.
Darüber hinaus ist es dem Anbieter gestattet,
                  personenbezogene Daten für einen längeren Zeitraum
