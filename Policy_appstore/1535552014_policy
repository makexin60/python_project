We use a variety of security measures and technologies to help protect your personal information.  We carefully choose service providers to work with, and check they have security measures and technologies in place to protect your personal information. We do not allow our service providers and suppliers to use your personal information for their own purposes.

All Personal Data is encrypted in transit and at rest (minimum 256-bit encryption)

Your responsibilities
Mentor by eDriving Application
Your participation in this program ensures your full understanding of your Company’s driver safety policies and requirements. As an authorized driver, you are entrusted to drive in a safe and responsible manner in accordance with all applicable local laws and Company policies.
You will download the Mentor app securely from the Apple or Android App Stores onto your corporate or privately-owned mobile phone. The Mentor app must ALWAYS remain loaded on the mobile phone on which the Mentor app is permitted to operate.  The location services must be ON for the app to function. The App only begins collecting driving information when the raw sensors detect driving motion.
It is your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws (including traffic laws) while using the Mentor app.
If your Monthly FICO® Safe Driving Score falls below 710 and/or you are involved in a collision, regardless of blame, you may start to have a regular (monthly) Road Safety Review with your Company until your score returns to greater than 710 for 3 consecutive months.
You must designate shifts/trips that are “Personal” or “Passenger” in the Mentor app to exclude them from your FICO Safe Driving Score.
Changes to this privacy policy
This Privacy Notice may change from time to time.  This notice was last updated on 29 October 2021.
On what legal basis do we use your personal information?
Data privacy law sets out the legal basis for which a company may collect and use your personal information. Please read the section below that is relevant to your country or region.
Risk reduction strategies and risk improvements – no personal information used; anonymous only
The Mentor Application will also be used to facilitate research on the effectiveness of the Global Driver Safety Program, and to develop and improve risk reduction strategies. The information used for research purposes will be anonymized by eDriving before it is entrusted to any other entity or used in connection with any research-related purpose.  This means it will be de-identified – fully and irreversibly stripped of all identifiers that can be attributed back to a specific individual. The research-related purposes for which such data may be used are limited to improving drivers’ safety and the effectiveness of the Global Driver Safety Program and will not be used for any other purpose.  Your data
will not be
sold, shared, or entrusted to any organization, in anonymized
or
identifiable form, for any purpose not specifically addressed in this notice. Organizations used for such research will be limited to authorized vendors and governmental agencies that are involved in occupational safety research.

To comply with your Company’s legal obligations
:
Every organization has a duty to protect the health, safety and welfare of their drivers and other people who might be affected by their business. Your Company must do whatever is reasonably practicable to achieve this. Processing your personal information for the purposes of providing driver safety education helps achieve the legal obligations in this respect.
Your Company has a legitimate interest
to process the data:
Your Company will use your personal information to ensure we provide the necessary guidance and training to drivers, in the interests of their personal safety and safety of others, and to appropriately manage risk within the business.
The countries to which your personal information may be sent or processed
eDriving will process your personal information in the UK and EU.  In some cases, US citizen driver data is stored in the US only. Check with your Company for details. Your
pseudonymized
personal information will be processed in the US. This means that your personal information will be removed, and the data will be assigned a random ID. This is to allow for FICO Safe Driving Score scoring in an unidentifiable format.
eDriving has implemented appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected and secure when it is transferred outside of your home country, in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. These measures include data transfer agreements implementing standard data protection clauses and additional measures.
