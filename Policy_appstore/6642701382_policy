It is important that you read this privacy notice together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.

2.1 THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
“Personal data”, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together follows:
• Identity Data includes: first name, initials, last name, username or similar identifier.
• Contact Data includes: email address only.
• Financial Data is not taken
• Transaction Data relates to your making an in-app purchase on an Amuzo App. Your Channel Provider only provides us with aggregated information so that we know how many users purchase content via the App Channel Provider, but we do not know the actual identity of those users. Please consult your App Channel Provider’s privacy notices for information on how they process this type of personal data.
• Technical Data includes your login data, time zone setting and location, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our Apps.
• Profile Data includes: your username and password.
• Usage Data includes: Analytics functions within Apps that compiles data. This data is anonymous.
• Marketing and Communications Data is not included in our Apps.
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific App feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
2.2 IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
3 HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?
We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
• Direct interactions. You may give us your Contact Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you: download our products or services; create an account on our Apps; subscribe to our service or publications; or give us some feedback.

Please refer to your App Channel Operator’s privacy notices;
• Technical Data and Usage Data from App Channel Operators relating to analytics. However, the App Channel Operator provides us with aggregated and de-identified information so we do not know it is specific to you or your device.

5.1 HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
• Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into, with you.
• Where it is necessary for our Legitimate Interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our Legitimate Interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
• Under a Performance of Contract. Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
• Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
• Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications, which we do not do within our Apps.
5.2 PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We have set out below a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our Legitimate Interests are where appropriate.

Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.
5.3 OPTING OUT
You can ask us to not use your data for marketing purposes. Where you opt out, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, product/service experience or other transactions.
5.4 CHANGE OF PURPOSE
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
6. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in Clause 4 above.
• Internal Third Parties as set out below.
• External Third Parties as set out below.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. These rules are called “binding corporate rules”. For further details, see European Commission: Binding corporate rules.
8. DATA SECURITY
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
9 DATA RETENTION
–
HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six (6) years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request Erasure below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
10.1 YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:
• Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
• Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
• Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
• Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
• Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
• Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
• Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
10.2 NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
10.3 WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
10.4 TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the request. Occasionally it may take us longer, if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.
We ask that where you request in writing via post you send the request via recorded delivery to ensure safe receipt.

We may change, upgrade, suspend or discontinue the Website and/or one or more parts and/or features of the Service at any time as we see fit without liability.
Limitation on our responsibility to you
If we fail to comply with these Terms of Use, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaching these Terms of Use or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us in advance.
We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or for breach of your legal rights.
We only supply the Service for domestic and private use. If you use the Service for any commercial, business, classroom (including without limitation if you use the Service in your capacity as an Educator) or re-sale purpose: (i) Amuzo will have no liability to you for any loss of profit or anticipated profit, loss of business, business interruption, loss of business opportunity, revenues or any indirect or consequential loss or damage; and (ii) Amuzo’s total aggregate liability under, arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use in contract or tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall in no circumstances exceed £10.00.
Linked websites
The Service may link you to other websites or otherwise include references to information, materials and/or services provided by other parties. These other websites and parties are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other aspect of the content of such websites, nor are we responsible for errors or omissions in any references to other parties or their products and services. The inclusion of such a link or reference is provided merely as a convenience and does not imply endorsement of, or association with, the website or party by us, or any warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.
Our rights to end this contract
Any failure to comply with any of these Terms of Use or any misrepresentation of any information furnished to us by you or anyone acting on your behalf may result in the immediate suspension or termination of your access to the Service without notice or liability to you. This is without prejudice to any other rights or remedies we may have under these Terms of Use or under applicable law.
Termination of our contract will not affect provisions of the contract that are said to operate or have effect after termination and will not affect any existing rights or obligations or any rights or obligations that are intended to commence on or continue after termination of the contract.
Other important terms
• Transferring rights. We may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under these Terms of Use to another organisation. You may not transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms of Use to another person.
• Variation. No variation of these Terms of Use that you purport will be effective unless we agree to it in writing.
• Severability. Each of the sections of these Terms of Use operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them or part(s) of them are unlawful, the remaining sections and parts will remain in full force and effect.
• Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms of Use, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of you breaching these Terms of Use, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
• Rights and remedies. The rights and remedies provided under the Terms of Use are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by applicable law.
• Disputes: We will try to resolve any disputes with you quickly and efficiently. If you are unhappy with any matter regarding our relationship with you please contact our customer support team. If you and we cannot resolve a dispute using our internal complaint handling procedure, you may use the online dispute resolution (ODR) platform to resolve the dispute with us.
• Governing law: These Terms of Use are governed by English law. Nothing in this section limits or excludes any mandatory consumer protections applicable in the country of your residence to which we are obliged to adhere.
Changes to these Terms of Use
We may make changes to these Terms of Use from time to time and may do so for a variety of reasons including without limitation to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices.
