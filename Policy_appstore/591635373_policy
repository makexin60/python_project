When we disclose the information
Recipe Cloud discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Recipe Cloud’s behalf or to provide services available through the Services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Recipe Cloud discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Recipe Cloud believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Recipe Cloud, third parties or the public at large.

We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Recipe Cloud takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Recipe Cloud encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
