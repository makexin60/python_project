The User who meets the conditions of letters (a) – (b) above will be notified in the Application, upon their first login in the Application after November 29, 2024, that they benefit from all the functionalities of the Application (regardless of whether they are included in the Premium version or the Unlimited version of the Application), without the need for further action on the part of the User to benefit from these functionalities.
At the time of expiry of the sixty (60) days, calculated from the first login in the Application of the User who meets the conditions of letters (a) – (b) above, after November 29, 2024, the User will be notified in the Application that they can choose to pay a subscription for access to one of the Premium versions, respectively Unlimited of the Application (depending on the type and/or number of functionalities that the User has used during the period of sixty (60) calendar days], with the following effects, depending on the User's choice:

(2)

The possibility of not paying a User Fee, under the conditions described in this art. 8.5. ind. 1, does not oblige the Company to keep this possibility for a certain period of time or to grant it for other or all Users, this aspect being at the Company’s sole discretion.
8.6. Payment of the Subscription Fee
In order to pay for the Subscription Fee, you will be prompted to insert the bank card details to be used for the payment. The bank card details can be changed at any time by you, after the initial setup. Also, you can use the Pago Points accumulated
                        in your Pago account in order to partially or fully pay for the Subscription Fee.
Also, distinct from the insertion of the bank card details at the time of making the first payment, you will have the possibility to add and save a bank card to your account, by accessing the menu Settings - My cards. If you choose to add a bank card
                        by this way, the bank card will be charged with a non-refundable amount of RON 0.2, with the purpose of verifying the card and saving it to your account.
For the avoidance of doubt, the non-refundable amount of RON 0.2 is charged only if you add a bank card by accessing the menu Settings - My cards. This amount will not be charged if the bank card is inserted at the time of the first payment.
The Company reserves the right to change the Subscription Fees indicated in Art. 8.4. and 8.5. above, which will be applicable starting with the next payment. In such cases, the Company will inform you in the App and using the email address inserted when creating the Pago account about the date when the new Subscription Fees will be applicable. For the avoidance of any doubt, unless provided otherwise in these Terms, the new Subscription Fees will not be applied to subscriptions that are ongoing on the date when the new Subscription Fees will be applicable.
In case of the Premium and Unlimited versions of the App, after activation, you will have a term of 15 (fifteen) calendar days during which you can unilaterally terminate the relationship with the Company regarding the activated subscription, regardless of the reason for such action. By unilaterally termination within the given term, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company, in relation to the Subscription Fee. For the avoidance of any doubt, after the expiry of the unilaterally termination term as described in this Article, you will owe the amounts indicated in Art. 8.4. and 8.5. above, as the case may be.
When activating the Premium or Unlimited versions of the App, in case you did not add a bank card to your account by using the menu Settings – My cards, you will need to insert the bank card details to be used for paying the Subscription Fee, as per Art. 8.4 and 8.5. above. In case the Company is not able to debit the card introduced with the value of the Subscription Fee for the version of the App that you have chosen, at the expiration of the 15 (fifteen) calendar days term indicated in the paragraph above, the Company will send you an email notification, using the email address entered for the registration of your account, in order to inform you about the declined payment and will offer you the possibility to add another card. If you will not add another card within 24 hours from the date the Company sent the email notification, the Free version of the App will be activated automatically, until you enter the data of another card that can be debited by the Company.
Following the end of a subscription period for which you have previously paid the Subscription Fee, a new subscription period which will be identical in duration to the previous one, will be activated and the Subscription Fee for this new period will
                        be debited automatically from the card you have introduced in the App for paying the Subscription Fee. This operation will be repeated upon the expiration of each subscription period until you express your wish to use a different
                        version of the App, in which case the terms and conditions of that version will be applicable, as described in this document for that respective version (Free, Premium, Limitless), starting with the end of the ongoing subscription
                        period corresponding to the most recently Subscription Fee that you have paid / debited from the card that you have entered in the App for payment of the Subscription Fee.
Deleting the account that you have created in the App will also cancel the automatic debiting of the card added for payments of the Subscription Fee with the amount representing the Subscription Fee for which you have opted.
At any time during the use of any version of the App, you can switch to a different version of the App. If you use one of the versions for which a Subscription Fee is charged (Premium or Limitless) and wish to use the Free version of the App, this option
                        will be recorded in the App and will be activated on the day following the expiration of the subscription period corresponding to the version used and for which you have paid. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Company will not
                        reimburse you any part of the Subscription Fee already paid, when you decide to switch to the Free version of the App.
