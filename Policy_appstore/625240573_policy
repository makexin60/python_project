We will post any modifications or changes to this Privacy Policy on this page.
We respect your privacy and your personal information and for this reason, we take all reasonable measures, in accordance with this Policy, to protect your personal information and to keep it confidential, even when you are no longer our customer.
Who we are and how to contact us
Who we are.
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of Zapper Marketing (Southern Africa) (Pty) Ltd so when we mention “Zapper”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to the relevant company(ies) in Zapper Marketing, its subsidiaries and associated companies responsible for processing your Personal Information.

You can contact us by emailing:
support@zapper.com
. Questions, comments or concerns regarding this Privacy and Cookie Policy or our use of your Personal Information are welcomed.
Your rights relating to your Personal Information
Your rights in connection with your Personal Information
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Information. This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing of your Personal Information. This right exists where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.
Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent. This right only exists where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information (
Consent Withdrawal
). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to the certain specific functionalities of our Services. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
How to exercise your rights
If you want to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us using the contact details shown here
Who We Are and How to Contact Us
Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Complaints
If you would like to make a complaint regarding this Privacy Policy or our practices in relation to your Personal Information, please contact us at:
support@zapper.com
.
We will reply to your complaint as soon as we can.
Marketing communications preferences
Zapper will not send you any marketing communication via SMS or email. The only communications we need to send to you is to notify you of changes to our terms and conditions and policies, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages regarding the Services.
If you give us permission, we may use your personal information to tell you about products, services and special offers from us or other companies that may interest you. We will do this through email, text message (SMS), social media platforms or notify you on your mobile applications. If you later decide that you do not want us to do this, please contact us through our customer service channels to stop this service.
What Personal Information we collect
All the Personal Information we collect, both from you and from third parties about you, is outlined in the table below.
Before you read that table, it might be useful to explain what
Personal Information
is. The POPIA definition of Personal Information can be found
here
. Essentially, it boils down to: information about an individual, from which that individual is either directly identified or can be identified.
It does not include ‘anonymous data’ (i.e., information where the identity of individual has been permanently removed)
However, it does include ‘indirect identifiers’ or ‘pseudonymous data’ (i.e., information which alone doesn’t identify an individual but, when combined with certain additional and reasonably accessible information, could be attributed to a particular person).
Category of Personal Information collected
What this means
Identity Data
First name, surname, date of birth, facial recognition via forward-facing camera.
Contact Data
Email address and telephone numbers.
Financial Data
Payment card details.
Transaction Data
Any details about payments to and from you and other details of services you have purchased from us. Data in respect of your transactions with third parties.
Service Data
Your data that you provide to us when you report a problem or ask a question in respect of our Services or when you request further services from us. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
Technical Data
This includes:
Device information: We may collect information about the device you use to access the Services, including your browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, mobile network information, telephone number and other technology on the devices you use to access our Services.
Location information: When you use one of our location-enabled Apps or Services, we may collect and process data about your actual location.
Log information: We may automatically collect and store certain information about your use of the Services in server logs, including but not limited to internet protocol (IP) addresses, internet service provider, clickstream data, browser type and language, viewed and exited pages and date or time stamps.
Unique application numbers: When you install or uninstall an App containing a unique application number or when such an App searches for automatic updates, that number and information about your installation, for example the type of operating system, may be sent to us.
Special Category of Personal Information
Application \ User Account Profile Picture.
Aggregated Data
We also collect, use and share
Aggregated Data
such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Information, but once in aggregated form it will not constitute considered Personal Information as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Behavioural Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Services feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Information so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Information which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Special Categories of Personal Information
The Zapper application has a feature to upload an image against your profile after a successful registration. This image is collected and stored on our system but never shared.
How we use your Personal Information and why
We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Without your personal information, we may not be able to provide or continue to provide you with the products or services that you need.
What is our

Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (
Compliance with Law
).
Where we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question (
Consent
).
We will process your personal information if you give us your consent willingly or in accordance with the law. You give your consent to us through the use of our product and services.
We will only disclose your personal information if:
the law requires it;

How we use cookies & other tracking or profiling technologies.
Cookies.
What are cookies?
We may collect information using
cookies
. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Other than our Site, our Services do not use cookies.
We use two broad categories of cookies:
first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device; and
third party cookies, which are served by our partners or service providers on our Site.
Cookies we use
Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:
Type of cookie
Purpose
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Site and require you to re-enter your password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
Functionality Cookies
These cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our Site and allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Site which you can customise. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Site. We also use these cookies to obtain information about your visit, including items you viewed or searched for, page response times and download errors.
Analytics and Performance Cookies
These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered via these cookies does not “directly” identify any individual visitor. However, it may render such visitors “indirectly identifiable”. This is because the information collected is typically linked to a pseudonymous identifier associated with the device you use to access our Site. The information collected is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily, as well as to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site. We also use these cookies to obtain information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream data, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from webpages.
We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Site works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here:
https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies
.

Disabling cookies
You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the
settings
,
help

or
edit
facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.
If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may not be able to recognise your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.
Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit

.
In particular, you can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting
http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices
. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.
You can also prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link:

Please note that certain third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. If you would like to disable these “third party” cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to that third party’s website and setting your cookie preferences to stop any further cookies being written to your device.
