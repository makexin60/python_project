21. US Residents – Arbitration Clause
Dispute Resolution for U.S. Residents: IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENTS, PLEASE READ THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN COURT. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THIS SECTION IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO U.S. RESIDENTS.
21.1 Informal dispute resolution procedure.
If a dispute arises between you and Jellyfish, we are committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. This requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if any, to the
        following email address: Attention General Counsel
legal@jellyfish.com
. For any dispute that Jellyfish initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address associated with your Jellyfish account. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the dispute, you and Jellyfish agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.
The above process for an informal dispute resolution process is required before you may commence any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.
21.2 Mutual arbitration agreement.
You and Jellyfish agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of these Terms (including its formation, performance, and breach) or payments by or to Jellyfish, or that in any way relate to the provision or use of the Website, your relationship with Jellyfish, or any other dispute with Jellyfish, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 21 (collectively, the “Arbitration Agreement”). This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in Sections 21.10 and 21.11). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and Jellyfish expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.
Except as set forth in this Section 21.2, the arbitrator or arbitration body, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Agreement (including these Terms) and this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part thereof are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court's jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initial chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party's claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party's right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.
You and Jellyfish agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Baltimore, MD in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
Except as set forth in Section 21.3 below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.
THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND THAT RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND JELLYFISH ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
21.3 Class arbitration and collective relief waiver.
YOU AND JELLYFISH ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN THIS SECTION 21.3 AND SECTION 21.7 BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER CONSOLIDATED ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIM, UNLESS JELLYFISH PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.
If there is a final judicial determination that either the Class Arbitration Action and Collective Relief Waiver or the provisions in Section 21.7 are not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or Jellyfish from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
21.4 Arbitration rules.
The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) and resolved before a single arbitrator. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider, but in no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association. Except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” provision, NAM will administer the arbitration in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation's Commercial Dept at
commercial@namadr.com
.
21.5 Initiating arbitration.
Only after the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure provision, and only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims using the procedures set forth in the applicable NAM rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to General Counsel
legal@jellyfish.com
. If Jellyfish is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Jellyfish account or the email that Jellyfish has on file for you. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party's failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Agreement.
21.6 Arbitration location and procedure.
If you are a resident of the United States the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside, and if you are not a resident of the United States the arbitration shall be conducted in Baltimore, MD, United States of America, unless you and Jellyfish otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Jellyfish submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.
Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Jellyfish (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).
21.7 Batch arbitration.
To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 21.4 if NAM is unavailable) against Jellyfish within reasonably close proximity (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with 21.4 if NAM is unavailable) in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Jellyfish and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Jellyfish and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Jellyfish otherwise consents in writing, Jellyfish does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in section 21.3 above and this section 21.7. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.
21.8 Arbitrator's decision.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with section 21.3 above and also must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section of the Agreement as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.
21.9 Fees.
You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Section 21.7), provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 21.9 while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.
21.10 Right to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” AS SET FORTH IN THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION 21, THEN:
(1) you must notify Jellyfish in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first use the Website or Services or otherwise become subject to this Arbitration Agreement (or any subsequent changes to the provisions of the section titled “Dispute Resolution”); (2) your written notification must be mailed to Legal Department or emailed to
legal@jellyfish.com
; and (3) your written notification must include (a) your name, (b) your address, (c) the date you purchased the product, if applicable and (d) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Jellyfish will continue to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of arbitration in a prior version of the Agreement pursuant to the requirements set forth in that version. If you do not timely opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, such action shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of these “Dispute Resolution” provisions by you and Jellyfish.
21.11 Changes.
Jellyfish will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any changes to this “Dispute Resolution” section by posting the change on Jellyfish's website, or providing any other notice in accordance with legal requirements. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Jellyfish provides this notice and apply to all claims not yet filed. If you reject any such changes by opting out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If Jellyfish changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Website 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out by providing notice as described in Section 21.10.

Cookies, similar technologies, and online advertising
We and our service providers may collect information through the use of “cookies” and similar technologies, such as tracking pixels, to distinguish you from other users of our website, to help us improve your experience of our website and our services, to understand how you navigate through and interact with our services, to learn what content is popular, to enhance the services and provide you with a more relevant and personalised experience, for authentication and advertising purposes, to save your preferences, for fraud detection and security, and to collect certain usage and device information as described above. For detailed information regarding the Cookies we use and the purposes we use them for, please refer to our
Cookie Policy
. We may also collect this kind of information when you interact with email messages or other communications we send you. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognise your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use our services. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email; they are designed to collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates, measure the popularity of our services and associated advertising, and access cookies. We and our vendors (including Google Analytics) also use these technologies and the information collected by them for data analytics purposes. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of our services.
We may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers, and others) on our services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you as you browse the internet. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect about you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
We sometimes also associate cookies with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) and disclose such information with to advertising partners and vendors in hashed, non-human-readable form to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.
The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our website by non-affiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link
or the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link
to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customise Google display network ads, visit the

How do we help to keep your data safe and secure?
The security of your personal data is important to us. We have put in place appropriate security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, or modification of your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet and no means of electronic or physical storage is absolutely secure. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it (e.g., encryption of more sensitive data elements such as payment information). When you give your personal data to Jellyfish we will process that data in accordance with our responsibilities.
To prevent unauthorised access, to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the correct usage of information, we monitor and adjust our physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your personal data while in our care, or in the care of any outside suppliers with whom we may contract to process your data on our behalf. Any outside suppliers are under strict contractual terms to mirror the security policies that we currently have in place.
Data retention
We will keep personal data only for as long as we need it to maintain our relationship with our contacts, provide them with the products, services or information they have requested, to inform our research into the preferences of our customers /clients, to comply with the law, to ensure we do not communicate with individuals that have asked us not to, and for other necessary purposes, like resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and for fraud prevention and related security purposes.. When we no longer need the information, we will dispose of it securely, using specialist companies to do this work for us if necessary.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.
Disclosing information to others
Primarily we use your information within Jellyfish in order to provide you with the service or product you have selected.
We will only disclose your information to specific third parties in the following circumstances:
To facilitate the service of a physical product, for example providing appropriate details (such as name, address, payment details as applicable) to the Product Owner of a print magazine subscription or subscription box.
We may use partners to help manage, monitor and optimise our Services to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, communications and how visitors use the Services.
If you have provided consent to receive marketing correspondence from the Product Owner of a product you have purchased through one of our Services, your data will be disclosed to them and/or the data processor authorised to operate on their behalf for the specific purposes to which you consented. In each of the above cases, the Product Owner will have their own privacy policy which will cover their use of your personal data.
Where we need to do so in order to provide a service you have requested. For example online transactions with us are secured using the SSL encryption method and hosted with our third party payment providers including Stripe, MPP Global Solutions Ltd, SagePay Europe Ltd and PayPal. This is to provide enhanced security and protection to our customers. All our payments processed via PayPal are processed via PayPal References Transactions.
We may use certain third party services to verify your identity in certain circumstances, such as that your postcode is valid for delivery, age for age restricted products and company checks.
It may be necessary to disclose information to certain third party industry bodies, such as the ABC or BPA, for audit and accreditation purposes, to confirm that sales have taken place.
To improve the service and advertising that you receive (on our Services and third party websites and apps). These activities may involve the use of cookies or similar technologies. For more information please review the “Cookies, similar technologies, and online advertising” section below and read our
Cookie Policy
.
If disclosure is required or permitted by law. We will always ensure that those requesting the information have the legal right to do so.
If another company should purchase any of our companies or assets, including our database, that company will have the right of possession of the personal data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations formerly attributable to us.
Data Transfers
We may transfer your personal data to a Product Owner based outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA), in a country with less stringent data protection laws. Where we do so we take the necessary steps to comply with applicable legal requirements and ensure any necessary appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place, so that your personal data is treated securely and your rights are respected. For further information about the documents we use to protect your information when it is transferred outside your country or region, please submit a request to
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
.
Your rights and choices
Depending on where you live, you may have the following rights and choices under data protection laws:
Rights regarding your information.
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to make certain requests regarding your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law). Specifically, you may have the following rights:
Direct Marketing:
You have the right to object to receiving direct marketing from us. You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails via the unsubscribe link provided in the emails or by emailing us at privacy@jellyfishconnect.com. Please note that it may take us some time, consistent with our legal obligations, to process your request. Even if you opt out from receiving marketing messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us, such as order confirmations, updates to our policies and practices, or other communications regarding our relationship or transactions with you.
Access:
You have the right to be provided with the information we hold for you or general information about the categories of personal data we process about you. This is known as a ‘Subject Access Request’.
Rectification:
If the information we hold for you is incorrect or needs amending, please let us know and we will update our records. Where available, you may view and amend these yourself in the My Account area of the relevant Service’s website.
Delete Data/Right to erasure and Account Closure
- you can ask us to erase or delete all of your personal data and record with us. If at any time you would like to close and delete an account please contact privacy@jellyfishconnect.com. Your personal data will be removed from our active user database and will be deleted assuming that you are current with all payment obligations, that Jellyfish does not believe it reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action, and that we are under no other legal obligation to retain such information. Please be aware that any unfulfilled subscriptions may be cancelled without refund, you will have to re-register in order to use the respective Service again, and any existing purchases will be forfeited. It is your responsibility to request a refund from Jellyfish or the appropriate merchant or Product Owner.
Restrict processing:
You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy,
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it,
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims,
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Data portability:
You have the right to have provided to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent:
Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Non-discrimination:
We are committed to ensuring that you will not be denied services, charged a different price, or provided a different level or quality of services just because you exercised your rights under applicable law. Please note, however, that we may need some personal data in order to provide you our services, which means that we may not be able to provide some of our services if you refuse to provide your personal data.
We may need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address.
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be permitted to designate an authorised agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorised agent to be verified, you must provide the authorised agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorised agent’s request.
Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. If we deny your request, we will provide you with information on how to appeal the decision, if applicable, in our communications with you.
If you would like further information regarding your legal rights or would like to exercise any of them, please email us at
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
or fill out this form.  If you are a United States resident, please see the “
Additional privacy information for California and Other United States residents

California and US Privacy Info
Additional privacy information for California and other United States residents
This section supplements our
Privacy Policy
with additional information for California and other United States residents about our information collection and use practices as required by U.S. laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”). In this section, the terms “personal information,” which also includes “personal data,” and “sensitive personal information” have the meaning set forth in such laws.
The following chart provides information about our practices in the 12 months leading up to the effective date of our Privacy Policy in relation to the categories of personal information that we collected generally – including the categories of sensitive personal information (precise location information and health information) – the purposes for which we use the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose the information for legitimate business purposes.

“Sale” and “Sharing” of Personal Information.
United States data law defines the “sale” of data as “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration”.  “Sharing” is defined as “sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer‘s personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.”
As explained in the “How We Disclose Information We Collect” section of our Privacy Policy, we provide personal information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our services, and use related analytics partners to assist us in analysing the effectiveness of our online advertisements. The disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, or, the “sharing” of your personal information for purposes of “cross-context behavioural advertising.”
The following chart lists the categories of personal information we have “sold” or “shared” over the last 12 months and the categories of third parties to which we have “sold” or “shared:”

As a United States resident, depending on the state in which you reside, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/use of your information for targeted advertising.”
If you would like to opt out of our online disclosure such as through cookie and pixel technology of your personal data for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” for purposes of targeted advertising, please click the "My Privacy Choices" link in our website footer and follow the instructions. You can also submit a request to opt out of our offline disclosures of information that are subject to applicable opt out rights by emailing us at
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
. Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may be permitted to designate an authorised agent to submit such requests on your behalf. If you have a legally-recognised browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognise such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal data of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorisation.
“Shine the Light” Disclosure.
You can exercise your rights under the California “Shine the Light” law – which gives you the right to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes – by emailing us at
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
.
Retention.
We will retain your data as described above in the “Data retention” section of our Privacy Policy.
Notice of Financial Incentives.
We may offer opportunities to receive certain benefits, such as discounts, promotion entries, or other similar incentives, which may require the provision of personal data, such as answering surveys or providing additional feedback or information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”). Your participation in Incentive Programs is purely voluntary. When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program. The monetary value of the reward, discount, or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of participation in the Incentive Program.
Notice Concerning Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognise or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about
Do Not Track
. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced above, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the "sharing” of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.
