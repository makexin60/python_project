The Owner may transfer Personal Data to Data Processors around the world in accordance with this privacy policy. Personal Data collected by the Owner will be transferred to the United States, Israel and Ukraine for the purposes as described in this privacy policy.

The Owner is allowed to transfer Personal Data collected within the EU to third countries (i.e. any country not part of the EU) only pursuant to a specific legal basis. Any such Data transfer is based on one of the legal bases described below:
Data transfer abroad based on standard contractual clauses. If this is the legal basis, the transfer of Personal Data from the EU to third countries is carried out by the Owner according to "standard contractual clauses" provided by the European Commission. This means that Data recipients have committed to process Personal Data in compliance with the data protection standards set forth by EU data protection legislation.

Data transfer abroad based on consent. If this is the legal basis, Personal Data of Users shall be transferred from the EU to third countries only if the User has explicitly consented to such transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards. In such cases, the Owner shall inform Users appropriately and collect their explicit consent via this Application.
Data transfer from the EU to the U.S based on Privacy Shield. If this is the legal basis, the transfer of Personal Data from the EU or Switzerland to the US is carried out according to the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield.
