The Edge Privacy Manifesto
Introduction
The Edge founders came together in 2013 with a mission to drive the fundamental benefits of cryptocurrency to the masses… financial freedom, autonomy, and most of all, privacy. However, to do so, we believed that the technology providing privacy needed to be hidden behind a user experience that is adoptable by users that couldn’t care less about these ideologies.
“Why? Leave them behind!” you say. If they’re willing to post a selfie in every location of their daily lives, use a public Venmo message when they pay back a friend, or use a centralized, full-KYC crypto custodian to hold their bitcoin, they don’t deserve the benefits that we, as privacy advocates, have strived to obtain through years of building.
But! You can’t forget one of the core principles of privacy: Privacy increases with an increase in the anonymity set. Said more simply, the more people using a privacy tool or protocol, the better privacy each user gets. Would you want to be one of two people using a private chat app like Signal or one of 2 million people? With only two people, it’s trivial to know the source and destination of the encrypted traffic, and therefore compromise the privacy of the participants.
So therein lies the challenge we’ve taken upon ourselves at Edge. Deliver the highest level of privacy we possibly can to the average Facebook, Tiktok and, god forbid, Venmo user. In pursuit of that mission, we’ve had to draw the line on what information Edge, the company and staff, will and will not have access to, and we make this provable with our open source code (
https://github.com/EdgeApp
).
All data generated in Edge (public keys, private keys, settings, balances, transactions, and enabled assets) is encrypted client-side, so while Edge may hold encrypted backups, it knows nothing about the accounts.
Edge will never access personal information including a name, email address, or phone number. Within Edge, this type of information may be requested to use our password recovery or exchange partners, but that info is NEVER associated with your encrypted Edge account, nor is it accessible by any Edge staff.
Edge will not know when a specific Edge user sends or receives cryptocurrency. Users’ transactions communicate directly to the blockchain networks through various nodes and APIs, not through Edge servers.
Edge DOES know exchange transactions created by our users due to reporting from our exchange partners and metadata on public decentralized exchanges. However, such exchange transactions cannot be associated with a specific Edge account.
Edge uses separate, independent master public and private keys for every wallet in an account and queries the various crypto blockchains for each wallet independently. This helps prevent association of each blockchain wallet with a single device or user.
Edge may use analytics tools to track user interactions ONLY for actions that would have already been known by our server. I.e., account creation, login, wallet creation, and exchange operations. However, tracking of exchange operations does not expose the specific Edge account that made such actions, and it does not associate the exchange operation with any other assets an account may hold that are not involved in the exchange.
Privacy is a human right
Privacy is more than a technical feature or a fleeting concern — it’s a fundamental human right, essential for individual freedom, dignity, autonomy, and personal security. Without privacy, the ability to make personal choices, express oneself freely, and manage one’s own finances is severely compromised. In an increasingly digital world, where surveillance and data harvesting have become the norm, financial privacy stands as a critical pillar in defending this right.
Bitcoin emerged from the cypherpunk ethos as a response to centralized financial control and surveillance, aiming to return power to the individual. The early pioneers of Bitcoin recognized that without privacy, true financial freedom could not exist. This ethos has carried forward into the development of privacy-focused assets like Monero and Zcash, which push the boundaries of what financial privacy can achieve. These assets enable private transactions, shielding individuals from the prying eyes of corporations, governments, and bad actors.
At Edge, we proudly align ourselves with this ethos. We believe that privacy is not just for those with something to hide — it’s for everyone. Privacy enhances security, fosters innovation, and empowers individuals to participate in the financial world without fear of judgment or reprisal. When privacy is compromised, financial freedom becomes an illusion. That’s why Edge integrates tools and technologies that uphold privacy by default, ensuring that every user, whether they’re transacting Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash, or any other supported asset, retains sovereignty over their financial data.
Privacy is a collective good. The more people who adopt privacy-preserving tools, the stronger the protections for everyone. At Edge, we’re not just building a wallet; we’re contributing to a movement that defends financial privacy as a cornerstone of a free and open society.
Conclusion
Privacy isn’t just a feature — it’s the foundation of everything we build. From encrypting user data client-side, to refusing to collect personal information, we prioritize privacy in every decision, every protocol, and every line of code. We believe that financial privacy is paramount, and we’re committed to creating tools that empower individuals while protecting their rights.
In a world where surveillance and control are on the rise, we stand firm in our belief that privacy is worth defending. It’s not just a niche feature for the tech-savvy, it’s a necessity for everyone. With Edge you can trust that your privacy is baked into every decision our company makes – because your freedom depends on it.
