Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

A.
Cookies
Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember certain information.
We use first-party and third-party cookies for the following purposes: (1) to make the Dasher Services function properly; (2) to improve the Dasher Services; (3) to recognize you when you return to our platforms and to remember information you have already provided, such as your preferences; (4) to collect information about your actions and activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests; and (5) to provide a secure browsing experience during your use of the Dasher Services.
You may disable the use of cookies by modifying your browser settings. If you choose to disable cookies you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Dasher Services. For more information on cookies and how to disable cookies visit

or

.
B.
Web Beacons
Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our platforms to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track and measure the performance of our platforms and services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).
C.
Session Replay
We may collect information on your use of our platforms or the Dasher Services, such as pages visited, links clicked, non-sensitive text entered, and mouse and scrolling movements. The information collected may include a recreation of your session interactions on our platforms. We take measures to utilize replay session technology to exclude and block sensitive user information.
D.
Online Analytics and Advertising Technologies
We and our third-party vendors may use automated technologies (including cookie identifiers on our platforms), along with other collected information, to tailor ads or deliver content when you are on the Dasher Services or on other devices, apps or websites.
E.
Targeted Advertising
We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique individual across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices. If you wish to opt out of such cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings. We may also use cross-device tracking to help identify individuals accessing our platforms and our users and to serve advertising. This type of advertising is often called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising and when it occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app” advertising.
You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising managed through third party processes by visiting (i) the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer
Opt-Out link
or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer
Opt-Out link
. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
. These links are provided for convenience purposes only; DoorDash is not responsible or liable for the compliance practices and programs of the companies managing the opt-out processes available through the above links. For information on how to opt-out of targeted advertising through DoorDash’s processes, please see Section 8 (Your Rights and Choices) of this Policy.
Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us. However, in that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
F.
Mobile Applications
Depending on your permissions, we may receive your personal information from your Internet service and mobile device providers. Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out in several ways. Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
. Each operating system, (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, etc.) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of in-application targeted advertisements. You should view your device or system “Settings” to determine how you can opt out of use of your device ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising.
G.
Marketing Activities
.
In addition to the other marketing and advertising activities described above, please see the following additional description of certain marketing and advertising activities.
Look-alike Modeling
. We may use personal information and/or link personal information to a third-party cookie or other similar technology to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with our marketing campaigns, which models are used to market or advertise the Dasher Services on third party platforms (e.g., websites, apps, etc.) to people who exhibit similar characteristics with the look-a-like modeled data.

Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising
. We may engage in targeted marketing or advertising to a Dasher based upon the Dasher’s personal information obtained from the Dasher’s activity across another company’s distinctly-branded websites, applications, or services, however, such activities are only on our behalf and for the benefit of us and the Dasher Services.

Our retention of your personal information may vary based upon the nature of our relationship with you (e.g., Dasher, Non-Dasher, etc.) and based upon several factors, including without limitation, the following:
(a) The length of time necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which we collected the personal information;
(b) When your relationship with us ceases or terminates;
(c) The length of time it is reasonable to keep records to demonstrate that we have fulfilled our business and legal duties and obligations and contractual commitments (as applicable);
(d) Any limitation periods within which claims can be made;
(e) Any retention periods prescribed by law or recommended by regulators, professional bodies, or associations; and
(f) The existence of any relevant legal proceedings.
6.
Third-Party Sites.
Some of the functionality may be provided by third parties and the Dasher Services may link to other third-party websites that are not controlled by DoorDash. These third parties are not under our control and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices. If you provide any personal information to any third party or through any such third-party website, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of that third party.
As part of onboarding or verifying your account, we may ask you to upload a selfie and a photo of your ID. Those images go directly to Persona Identities, Inc. (“Persona”), one of our service providers.
Persona processes these images, including by generating data about your facial geometry (which may be considered to be biometric data in some jurisdictions) for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud. This may involve comparing the biometric data generated from your selfie to the biometric data generated from your ID, as well as comparing the biometric data generated from your images to the biometric data generated from other images. Persona stores the biometric data and uses it to perform ongoing identity-verification and fraud-prevention screenings and permanently deletes the data when it is no longer needed to fulfill those purposes, or within three years of the initial creation of the data, whichever is sooner. Persona relies on service providers to process the biometric data and other information for these purposes. For more information on Persona’s policies, please visit Persona’s Privacy Policy (
https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy
).
Persona sends DoorDash the results of this screening but not the biometric data used to perform it. DoorDash does not collect or have access to the biometric data generated by Persona to perform these services.

GLBA
.
DoorDash is not a bank or financial institution. However, DoorDash may collect, process, retain, and/or disclose non-public personal information (
“NPI
”) in connection with the DoorDash Crimson program (“
Crimson
”), which enables you to sign up for certain banking services through our program partner, Starion Bank (“
Sponsor Bank
”). DoorDash processes such NPI as a service provider to Sponsor Bank, resulting in several important distinctions that we explain below.
When processing NPI as a service provider to Sponsor Bank, your NPI is protected by the federal Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (“
GLBA
”) and is exempt from U.S. state privacy laws (such as the CPRA).
Our processing of your NPI is governed by Sponsor Bank’s instructions and
Privacy Policy
, not this Policy. For details on Sponsor Bank’s privacy practices, including your rights, please refer to their
Privacy Policy
. While DoorDash is not responsible for Sponsor Bank’s
Privacy Policy
, we strongly encourage you to read it. If you have questions regarding their
Privacy Policy
or how they handle your NPI, please contact the Sponsor Bank directly.
DoorDash processes NPI collected in connection with Crimson solely to provide the Crimson service, with one exception: we may ask for your opt-in consent to additional uses and/or disclosures of your NPI. If you provide such consent, DoorDash may combine your NPI with other information we collect about you, such as your Dashing activity, and use your combined data to personalize and improve your experience, qualify you for premium offers, and market to Dashers like you. If you choose to give consent, you may later revoke your consent by calling 1-855-973-1040. Upon revocation, we will stop processing your NPI for the purposes described in the consent.

California Specific Disclosure Requirements
.
i.
Notice of Financial Incentives
.
Under the CPRA, we are required to provide certain disclosures regarding “financial incentives” offered in exchange for your disclosure of personal information to us. We provide several opportunities or programs where individuals can provide personal information to us in exchange for financial incentives, including in connection with participation in survey research, sweepstakes programs, Referral programs, and product and partnership opportunities. In addition, for Referral programs, the referred party or person can also receive incentives for participation. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow, enhance, and improve our Dasher Services and business activities and provide benefits to those who participate. For the various financial incentives that we offer, we have not assigned a monetary value to the data we collect through or in connection with our financial incentive programs; however, based upon our good faith reasonable estimate, the value we receive from your personal information is reasonably equal to the value of the financial incentive we provide to individuals who participate in these programs. The material terms for the financial incentives are available with the applicable offer that you may receive prior to you voluntarily deciding to participate. If you want to opt-out of participating in an incentive program, please either stop participating or email us at
