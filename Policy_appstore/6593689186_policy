Information Collection
In the free version, we do not collect any personal data. As with most standard apps and websites, we use log files which include IP addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, and click counts to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements in aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.
