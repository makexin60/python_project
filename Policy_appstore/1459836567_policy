Your privacy matters to us
This section outlines our policy relating to any personal information you might wish to provide us when you visit our site. Your use of our website indicates your acceptance of our website Terms of UAE and this privacy and security statement.
Our business has been built on trust between our customers and ourselves. Unless legally compelled to disclose, we have a commitment to safeguard and keep confidential any information relating to our customers or their financial affairs. Whether it is provided to us in person at one of our branches, over the phone, or while visiting this site, we will strive at all times to ensure that the information is kept confidential and secure.
We may pass information about you and your dealings with us to other HSBC Group Companies or our agents to the extent allowed by law.
All HSBC Group Companies, all our staff and all third parties with permitted access to your information are specifically required to observe our confidentiality obligations.
We will not collect any personal information that identifies a visitor to this site individually unless specified otherwise. Your visit to this site will record only the Domain Name Server part of your email address and of the pages visited. Such information will be used to prepare aggregate information about the number of visitors to the site and general statistics on usage patterns.
Some of this information will be gathered through the use of 'cookies'. Cookies are small pieces of information that are automatically stored on a person's web browser in their computer that can be retrieved by this site.
You can set your browser to disable persistent cookies and/or session cookies but if you disable session cookies, although you will be able to view our public unsecured website, you will not be able to log onto online banking.
Copyright and trademarks
We and other parties own the trade marks, logos and service marks displayed on this site and users are prohibited from using the same without our written permission or of such other parties.
The materials on this site are protected by copyright and no part of such materials may be modified, reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, transmitted (in any form or by any means), copied, distributed, used for creating derivative works or used in any other way for commercial or public purposes without our prior written consent.
No warranties
While every care has been taken in preparing the information and materials contained in this site, such information and materials are provided to you 'as is' without warranty of any kind either express or implied. In particular, no warranty regarding non-infringement, security, accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose or freedom from computer virus is given in conjunction with such information and materials.
Email
Email messages sent to us over the internet cannot be guaranteed to be completely secure. We will not be responsible for any damages incurred by users if they send a message to us, or if we send a message to them at their request, over the internet. We are not responsible in any manner for direct, indirect, special or consequential damages arising out of the use of this website.
Transmission over the internet
Due to the nature of the internet, transactions may be subject to interruption, transmission blackout, delayed transmission and incorrect data transmission. HSBC will not be liable for malfunctions in communications facilities not under our control that may affect the accuracy or timeliness of messages and transactions you send.
Security
We maintain strict security standards and procedures with a view to preventing unauthorised access to your data. We use leading technologies such as (but not limited to) 256 bit DigiCert
secure socket layer data encryption, fire walls and server authentication to protect the security of your data. Access to your account and account information is protected by a password which you set.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. If your browser is appropriately configured it should tell you whether the information you are sending will be secure (generally by displaying an icon such as a padlock). The combination of a secure browser at your end and our security measures provide you with the best security currently available.
Once we receive your information, we will take all reasonable steps to protect the information If we no longer need your information, we will destroy or de-identify it.
Cookies
Our public website and online banking services, along with most other major websites, use cookies.
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to the cookie file on your computer’s hard disk. Cookies enable users to navigate around the website and (where appropriate) enable us to tailor the content to fit the needs of visitors who have accessed the site.
We use two types of cookie on our website.
Session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your computer until you close your browser at which point they are deleted.
Persistent or stored cookies that remain permanently on the cookie file of your computer.
Cookies cannot look into your computer and obtain information about you or your family or read any material kept on your hard drive and, unless you have logged onto online banking, cookies cannot be used to identify who you are.
Cookies cannot be used by anyone else who has access to the computer to find out anything about you, other than the fact that someone using the computer has visited a certain website.
If you have logged in to our mobile banking or personal online banking, then we may, using the data gathered through cookies, contact you via post, email or phone in accordance with our personal online banking Agreement. We may use cookies to show you subtly tailored content on our website or other websites of things we think you might be interested in, but only in relation to HSBC products and services. You will never see advertising on our website from anyone other than HSBC group companies and our agents. The cookies we use are completely safe. In fact, many of them are used purely to provide important security features such as protecting your data and your accounts.
We use email analytics and reporting tools to see how many of our emails are opened and which links receive the most clicks. Knowing which articles and topics our customers like and which they don't like helps us improve our content and make our emails more relevant.
We maintain strict security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorised access to information about you. HSBC will never contact you by email or otherwise to ask you to validate personal information such as your user ID, password, or account numbers. If you receive such a request, please call us on +
