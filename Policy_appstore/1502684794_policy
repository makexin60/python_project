How we use your Personal Data?
We use Personal Data and other data you provide to us only for the following purposes permitted by applicable laws:
When necessary for the performance of a contract with you:we may use your data on the basis of our need to perform our obligations under a contract with you, to complete your transactions or other requests made by you, to respond to and process your queries or requests, or to contact you as necessary in connection with our performance of a contract with you. For example, if you enter into a contract for our remittance services, your data will necessarily be shared with the payment service provider that will pay out funds to your designated beneficiary in the remittance destination country, it may be shared with our agents and/or contractors to facilitate the refund of a qualifying payment order to you, and it may be used if we find it necessary to contact you in connection with our contract.
When necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation:we may use your data to comply with legal requirements and/or regulations specific to our business. For example, when you contract with us for remittance services, we are required to perform a certain level of due diligence prescribed by law and/or commensurate with any assessed risk which may result in the reporting of your data to legal and/or regulatory authorities and/or a request from us for additional information from you to assist in our risk assessment and/or to satisfy our compliance obligations.
When you have provided your consent for the processing:if you have consented and you have not withdrawn your consent, we may contact you with marketing communications in relation to our Services or the services and products of RCL Companies (see Section 10 Direct Marketing, below).
When necessary in the pursuit of a legitimate interest of RCL:if you provide information to us online or transact with us online, we may use your data to improve the content of our Website and Services in order to enhance your experience. We may use data, such as IP addresses and anonymous demographic data, to tailor your experiences with our Services by showing content in which we think you will be interested and displaying content according to your preferences. We may use aggregate data for a variety of purposes, including analysing user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in (and use of) the various portions and areas of our Services. We also may use the data collected to evaluate and improve our Services and analyse traffic to our Services.
If in the future we use your Personal Data in the pursuit of our legitimate interest, we will strive to align our interests with yours such that under no circumstances will your data be used except as consented to by you or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such data without further notice to you.
Is data collected shared with third parties?
RCL Companies
We may share your personal data with other RCL Companies in order to enable or facilitate us to provide you with any of the Services you have requested, where you have asked us to do so, to provide the Services to you outside of normal UK business hours and, where you have consented and not withdrawn your consent, for the RCL Companies` direct marketing purposes.
Third-party service providers
We may share your Personal Data with the following third-party service providers to manage, enable or facilitate certain aspects of the Services (including the maintenance of our servers and processing or fulfilling orders for transactions):
Compliance verification service providers
Financial services providers, such as banks (Some of which are based outside the EEA)
Credit control or debt collection agencies
We have safeguards in place with such third-party service providers requiring them to protect your personal data. To obtain a copy of the relevant safeguard measures please contact the Remit Choice Data Protection Officer as indicated in Section 1 above.
Corporate process
We may transfer your Personal Data to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger or reorganization involving RCL, a company within the RCL Group, or any of their respective assets. In these circumstances, we will take reasonably appropriate steps to make sure that your information is properly protected.
Legal and regulatory
We may also disclose your Personal Data in special cases if required to do so by law enforcement agencies, law, court order, or other governmental authority, or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this data is otherwise necessary or advisable, such as to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to–or interfering with–; the rights or property of RCL, the Services, another user, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities (for example, identify theft or fraud).
Sharing Personal Data outside the United Kingdom
The nature of our products and Services means that we may need to share your Personal Data with recipients based in countries outside of the United Kingdom, including in the EEA and outside the EEA. The countries to which we may need to send your information would normally be obvious to you based on your requested transaction.
As explained above, we may share your personal data within the RCL Group, which may involve transferring your data outside the EEA. Where we do so, we will ensure a similar level of protection to that afforded in the EEA; for example, on the basis the relevant recipient country has been deemed by the European Commission to provide an `adequate` level of protection for Personal Data or by contractual provisions that seek to ensure a level of protection and safeguarding of Personal Data.
If our use of third-party service providers involves sharing your Personal Data outside the EEA, we will make sure the service provider provides safeguards and assurances regarding the protection of your Personal Data.
How long is Personal Data retained?
Personal Data is used for different purposes and is subject to different standards and regulations. In general, Personal Data is retained for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services you request, to comply with applicable legal, accounting or reporting requirements and to make sure that you have a reasonable opportunity to access the Personal Data.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example:
Legal and Regulatory Requirements. RCL shall retain Personal Data and transactional data for those periods required to comply with all retention and reporting obligations under applicable laws, including without limitation commercial, tax and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Generally, this retention period will be a minimum of five years from the date of your transaction or the date our business relationship with you is terminated.
Customer Service (administration of customer relationship, complaint handling, etc.). RCL may process and retain your Personal Data for as long as we have an on-going relationship with you. Once our relationship has ended (for example because the Services have been delivered and paid for in full, or you have exercised your right to withdraw from the contract), we will, subject to any retention requirements under applicable laws, erase or anonymise your Personal Data.
Personal Data provided to us for marketing purposes may be retained until you opt out or until RCL becomes aware that any such data is inaccurate.
You may obtain a copy of our Retention Policy by contacting our Data Protection Officer.
Is correspondence that you send to us saved?
Yes. If you send us correspondence, including emails and faxes, we may retain such data along with any records of your account. We may also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence involving you, us and any RCL Group company, our partners, and our suppliers. We will retain these records in line with our Retention Policy.
Data Security
We are committed to maintaining the security of your Personal Data and have measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the data under our control.
We employ modern and secure techniques to protect our systems from intrusion by unauthorized individuals, and we upgrade our security regularly as better methods become available. Our data centers and those of our partners utilise state-of-the-art physical security measures to prevent unauthorised access to the facility. In addition, all Personal Data is stored in a secure location behind firewalls and other sophisticated security systems with limited (need-to-know) administrative access. All RCL employees who have access to, or are associated with, the processing of Personal Data are contractually obliged to respect the confidentiality of your data and abide by the privacy standards we have established. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot (and do not) guarantee the absolute security of Personal Data.

We set out below personal information that we generally process in connection with all our products and services.
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE GENERALLY PROCESS IN CONNECTION WITH ALL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
This includes:
When you download our Mobile App, in addition to the information mentioned above we collect and process:
·
Information you give us.
·
This is the information that you consent to give to us about you when you download or register to use the Mobile App or website, subscribe to our services or by corresponding with us. This information includes identity, contact, financial and marketing and communications data. If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence.

We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running.

To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.
·
Location Data.
·
Mobile Analytics Data.
·
We may collect this data to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the mobile app, the events that occur within it,
aggregated usage, performance data, and where the mobile app was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal data you submit within the mobile app.
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We will generally collect your personal information from you directly. If you are introduced to us by a broker or other intermediary, we will obtain some personal information about you indirectly from them when they introduce you to us.
In addition, we obtain your personal information from other sources such as Fraud Prevention Agencies, and other organisations to assist in prevention and detection of crime, police and law enforcement agencies.
Some of the personal information obtained to verify your account will have originated from publicly accessible sources. In particular, the information will draw on court decisions, bankruptcy registers and the electoral register (also known as the electoral roll).
DATA THAT YOU PROVIDE ABOUT THIRD PARTIES
At your request, where you provide us with information about third parties, e.g., recipients of transfers, we will also collect personal information in relation to those people (`Receiver Information`). By providing us with such information you confirm that you have obtained any necessary permissions from such persons to the reasonable use of the Receiver Information for such purposes in accordance with this notice, or are otherwise permitted to give to us the Receiver Information on their behalf. Please ensure that those other people are aware of this notice and that the provisions of this notice are clearly communicated to them.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR DATA AND WHO DO WE SHARE IT WITH?
We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to do so. Most commonly we use your personal information in the following purposes:
Transactional Purposes
We need to collect your personal information in order to process your transactions. To do so we require you and your receivers bank account details or full name and address. Without the Receiver Information we would not be able to fulfil your transactions.
Regulatory Purposes
As a regulated institution, Remit Choice must comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing Regulations. As a result, Remit Choice (and its partners) must conduct Know Your Customer (`KYC`) and Customer Due Diligence (`CDD`) checks to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. Any personal information obtained for the purposes of preventing money laundering or terrorist financing is only used for that purpose. There may be occasions where use of the data is permitted under another enactment. All of this helps us keep our service safe and secure.
Marketing Purposes
We may process your personal information to provide you with certain types of marketing communication that we believe will be relevant and of interest to you. This helps us to provide a more personalised service. We will always endeavour to make these communications relevant and un-intrusive, and you are able to object to marketing communication from us at any time.
Analytical Purposes
We may collect and analyse data such as website or app visit logs, on our own or by using services of third parties, in order to improve the quality of our service.
In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when it is necessary for the fulfilment of the service or to comply with applicable laws. We set out below some purposes for which we may share your personal information with third parties:
we may share your personal information with third parties, such as our partners and intermediaries, when they are necessary for the fulfilment of the service; and
·
we may share your personal information when required by law, for example for the purposes of security, taxation and criminal investigations.
·
We may also, from time to time, ask you for your consent for other purposes, which we will explain to you at the time. Much of what we do with your personal data is not based on your consent and is instead based on other legal grounds. However, for processing that is based on your consent, you have the right to revoke that at any time.
WHAT ARE THE LEGAL GROUNDS FOR OUR PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (INCLUDING WHEN WE SHARE IT WITH OTHERS)?
Data protection laws require us to explain what legal grounds justify our processing of your personal information (this includes sharing it with other organisations). For some processing more than one legal ground may be relevant (except where we rely on a consent). Here are the legal grounds that are relevant to us:

All stages and activities relevant to processing your transaction(s) including enquiry, registration, administration, management and requests for transfers; and
For some of our profiling and other automated decision making.
2) Where we consider that it is appropriate for us do so, processing is necessary for the following legitimate interests which apply to us and in some cases other organisations (who we list below) are:

Buyers and their professional representatives as part of any restructuring or sale of our business or assets;

To carry out identity checks, anti-money laundering checks, and checks with Fraud Prevention Agencies pre-application, at the application stage, and periodically after that.
To carry out monitoring and to keep records (see below);
To deal with requests from you to exercise your rights under data protection laws;
To process information about a crime or offence and proceedings related to that (in practice this will be relevant if we know or suspect fraud); and
When we share your personal information with these other people or organisations:
Other payment services providers such as when you ask us to share information about your account with them;
Other account holders or individuals when we have to provide your information to them because some money paid to you by them should not be in your account;
Law enforcement agencies and governmental and regulatory bodies and

4) Processing with your consent:
When you request that we share your personal information with someone else and consent to that;
For direct marketing communications; and
For some of our profiling and other automated decision making.
HOW AND WHEN CAN YOU WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT?
Much of what we do with your personal information is not based on your consent, instead it is based on other legal grounds. For processing that is based on your consent, you have the right to take back that consent for future processing at any time. You can do this by contacting us using the details below. The consequence might be that we cannot send you some marketing communications (but this outcome will be relevant only in cases where we rely on explicit consent).
IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERRED OUTSIDE AUSTRALIA?
From time to time, your personal information may be transferred to, stored in or accessed from a destination outside Australia. It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the Australia who work for us, or one of our partners.
We share your personal information within the Remit Choice UK Group. This will involve transferring your personal data to our central office function, based in Pakistan. We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the Australia, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Australia.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Our servers are hosted in the United Kingdom and the information is encrypted.
Our service facilitates the transfer of currency to jurisdictions across the globe. The recipient pay-out partner will request information to verify the identity of the sender. Your personal information will therefore be transferred to the jurisdiction to which you choose to transfer the currency.
Unfortunately, transmission of information via the internet cannot be considered completely secure. We do our utmost to protect your personal information, however we cannot guarantee the security of those transfers. Any transmission of your personal information is at your own risk.
Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security controls to try to prevent unauthorised access.
WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION CHANGES?
You should tell us without delay so that we can update our records.
DO YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US?
We are unable to provide you with products and services or to process your application without having personal information about you. Your personal information is required before you can open an account with us, or it is required during the life of that contract, or it is required by laws that apply to us.
In cases where providing some personal information is optional, we will make this clear. For instance, we will say in application forms, on website or on in our mobile app if alternative (such as work) telephone number contact details can be left blank.
DO WE DO ANY MONITORING INVOLVING PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
In this section monitoring means any listening to, recording of, viewing of, intercepting of, or taking and keeping records (as the case may be) of calls, email, text messages, social media messages, in person face to face meetings and other communications.
Some of our monitoring may be to comply with regulatory rules, self-regulatory practices or procedures relevant to our business, to prevent or detect crime, in the interests of protecting the security of our communications systems and procedures, to have a record of what we have discussed with you and actions agreed with you, to protect you and to provide security for you (such as in relation to fraud risks on your account) and for quality control and staff training purposes.
Some of our monitoring may check for obscene or profane content in communications.
We may conduct short term carefully controlled monitoring of your activities on your account(s) where this is necessary for our legitimate interests or to comply with our legal obligations. For instance, where we suspect fraud, money laundering or other crimes.
Email exchanges, web chat, telephone calls and in person meetings between us and you in connection with your application and/or your account(s) may be recorded to make sure that we have a record of what has been discussed and what your instructions are. We may also record these types of calls for the quality control and staff training purposes.
PROFILING AND OTHER AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
This section is relevant where we make decisions about you using only technology, and where none of our employees or any other individuals have been involved in the process. For instance, in relation to transactions, triggers and events such account opening anniversaries and maturity dates. We may do this to decide what marketing communications are suitable for you, to analyse statistics and assess lending and insurance risks.
We can do this activity based on our legitimate interests (and they are listed in the section about legal grounds above) only where the profiling and other automated decision making does not have a legal or other significant effect on you. In all other cases, we can do this activity only where it is necessary for entering into or performing the relevant contract, is authorised by laws that apply to us, or is based on your explicit consent. In those cases, you have the right to obtain human intervention to contest the decision (see `rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you` below). Profiling for direct marketing can mean there is a separate right to object (see `rights to object` below).
FOR HOW LONG IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION RETAINED BY US?
Unless we explain otherwise to you, we will hold your personal information for up to 7 years, in accordance with local regulations as applicable, following the termination of our relationship in case of:
queries from you;
legal claims by you; and/or
legal and/or regulatory requirements to which we are subject.
If you would like further information about our data retention practices, please
contact us
.
We may retain your contact information collected for the purposes of sending you marketing communications in accordance with this policy for as long as you do not unsubscribe from receiving the data from us.
WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER DATA PROTECTION LAWS?
Here is a list of the rights that all individuals have under data protection laws. They do not apply in all circumstances. If you wish to exercise any of them, we will explain at that time if they are engaged or not.
The right to be informed about your processing of your personal information;
The right to have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal information completed;
The right to object to processing of your personal information;
The right to restrict processing of your personal information;
The right to have your personal information erased (the `right to be forgotten`);
The right to request access to your personal information and to obtain information about how we process it;
The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information (`data portability`);
Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you.
If you are unhappy with our response, Under the Privacy Act you may complain to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner about the way we handle your information.
The Commissioner can be contacted at: GPO Box 5218 Sydney NSW 2001 Phone: 1300 363 992 Email: enquiries@oaic.gov.au www.oaic.gov.au
In addition, you have the right, at any time, to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights against the Credit Reference Agencies or any other intermediary who is data controller in its own right, you should contact them separately.
DATA ANONYMISATION AND USE OF AGGREGATED INFORMATION
Your personal information may be converted into statistical or aggregated data which cannot be used to re-identify you. It may then be used to produce statistical research and reports. This aggregated data may be shared and used in all the ways described in this privacy notice.
We will only share anonymised and encrypted data with third parties. We may also provide our partners with anonymous aggregated data about our customers for marketing and analytical purposes, to help optimise our marketing communications.
YOUR MARKETING PREFERENCES AND WHAT THIS MEANS
We may use your home address, phone numbers, email address and social media (e.g., Facebook, Google and message facilities in other platforms to contact you to send you communications about offers or promotions that we believe are relevant for you based on your previous use. We will only do this if we have a legal ground which allows it under data protection laws – see above for our legal ground for marketing. You can opt out of our marketing at any time by contacting us or by following the instructions on how to do that in the marketing email or other communication.
DATA PRIVACY NOTICES FROM OTHER ORGANISATION
S
We have mentioned that we share your personal information with receiver banks, partners who help us to complete your transactions and Credit Reference Agencies. They require us to pass on to your information about how they will use your personal information to perform their services or functions as data controllers in their own right. These notices are separate to our own.
In addition, when you log into your account via Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter or LinkedIn your data will be processed by these policies and as such your personal information will also be subject to these third-party privacy notices.
In circumstances where you use your Facebook or Google login credentials to create and/or log in to your account your personal information may be processed by Facebook or Google marketing tools. These tools identify individuals with reference to their particular interests or behaviours to those of our customers.

It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
The Company recognizes the importance of having a well-planned and organized “incident” response program in instances where a customer’s personal and private information may have been disclosed or disseminated to an unauthorized third-party entity or individual. The Company’s team leaders all provide certain and specific training to all agents, employees in responding to non-public, personal customer information disclosure.
Although the Company is a non-banking financial institution (“MSB”), it does not function in the capacity of a depository institution. Regardless, the Company strictly adheres to GLBA (Gram-Leach-Bliley Act) guidelines due to the fact that the Company and its representatives frequently come in first-person contact with certain non-public personal information of its customers. For this reason, the Company takes every measure to ensure and is truly committed to protecting its customers’ personal information by keeping all information gathered in a secure and private environment.
The Company’s management maintains a strict policy of never disclosing any materials or information of a non-public, personal nature to any outside, third-party, regardless of if the information pertains to a customer, Agents, Agents employee, Authorized Delegate / Agent Employee (currently not engaged or using any agents), correspondent account or relationship, and the like.
