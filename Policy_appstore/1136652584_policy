If you can make a list or send an email, you can use Nutrium. Starting an appointment is really that simple.
Sub-section Policy: 
Sub-policy 0
https://nutrium.com/privacy_policy/professionals:
1. Introduction
We care for your privacy and we want to share with you everything we do with your personal data. Throughout Nutrium's Privacy Policy you will be able to check what rights you have at your disposal, what data we treat and with whom we share it, the period for which the personal data will be stored, and much more.
We made sure that this Policy is as transparent, clear and concise as possible. It is important that you read it carefully and calmly since the privacy we guarantee is only as complete as your knowledge of it.
We also recommend the full reading of the Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter GDPR), where you can learn more on privacy and protection of personal data.
2. Who are we?
Healthium - Healthcare Software Solutions, S.A., (hereinafter, “Healthium”), dedicates itself to the development of software, namely in the health area, being, in particular, the company responsible for the creation and development of the Nutrium software, in its various aspects. Aimed at Nutrition Clinics and Professionals, Nutrium enables the simplification of complex tasks such as planning, analysis and creation of food plans, nutritional measurements and calculations, information management and analysis, and much more. Healthium is, therefore, the entity that manages the processing of personal data collected through the Nutrium software, acting, mainly, as processor of the Professional, pursuant to the GDPR.
3. Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the website
https://nutrium.com
and its subdomains, whether or not they register, to all users of the mobile application, from the moment they install it on their device mobile, to all users of the platform who register for the trial period as well as for all those who actually contract our services after the trial period ends.
The application of this Privacy Policy is irrelevant to the territorial scope, applying to all users from the moment they open our website or our mobile application, no matter where they are located.
The use of the services provided by Healthium is conditioned by the acceptance of the
Terms and Conditions of Use
and the reading of this Policy. In the event that you do not agree to these stipulations, please do not use our services.
4. What Data do we Collect?
The collection and processing of data is fundamental to the operation of Nutrium. It's based on that data that our project is built and it's that informational core that allows us to provide you with a service in the area of nutrition and client management that is known for its excellence. We have reviewed and limited the data collection and the period of retention of the data to the minimum necessary.
There are various sets of information and data that we collect and process. To simplify, we'll be dividing those sets of information in three large groups: Professionals, Clients and Secretaries.
5. Professionals' Data
Data required from the Professional upon registration
: all data entered by the Professional when registering on the platform is stored and processed. It is this registry that allows us to identify the Professional and give him access to the reserved area of query management as well as correctly connect him to the clients that he inserts. In addition, this is the data we deem indispensable, together with the billing data, so that the contractual relationship between Healthium and the Professional is carried out regularly. The data we require when registering is: the full name, the name of the primary place of work, the gender, country of residence, email and, of course, a password. In addition to these, all data voluntarily inserted by the Professionals during their use of the software is processed.
Payment data
: the payment data of your monthly payment are also processed by Nutrium, although for this purpose a processor is used. Only then can we debit the amounts associated with the monthly payment you have chosen. The data required for this purpose is: a credit or debit card number, an expiration date and a security code.
Billing data
: in order to comply with our tax obligations, we must ask you for some billing information such as: name, tax number, address, city, postal code and country.
Automatically collected data
: in addition to the data mentioned above, we also automatically collect, through cookies and other methods and services, a set of data that allows us to know precisely how you use the platform, the country, the date and time of the login, among other information. In addition to this information we also collected other data such as the I.P. address, the browser you use to access and its version, the language, your device operating system, among others. We would like to emphasize that this type of data collection is mainly intended to facilitate the work of our team whenever you need our support. It's the collection of these groups of information that allows the quick resolution of problems on our platforms, without it we wouldn't be able to guarantee the normal operation of our service and its maintenance. For more information please check our section on how we disclose and share data with third parties (subprocessors) and our cookie policy.
6. Clients' Data
Clients' data is directly collected, for the most part, by the Professional. He is the controller and the main responsible for the processing of the clients' personal data. Having said that, besides a minimum set of legally required measures, Healthium is not responsible for providing the information and guarantees imposed by the GDPR on the Professionals in regard to their relationship with the Client.
A series of personal data might be requested by the Professional to the Client, or recorded by observation, which may range from “simple” personal data categories (such as: billing data, user identification number, among others, such as name complete, address, cell phone, and many more) to data considered as “special” (examples of this type of data include race, personal and social history, clinical history, food history, body measurements, among other information).
Healthium only treats Client data as it is entered by the Professional, or directly through the mobile application. The use of the mobile application is intended for use by clients and is, of course, optional and, in cases where it is used, we collect the following data:
Data entered by the client
: all data entered by the Client, be it when logging in into the mobile application or posteriorly, is stored and processed. It's this set of data that allows us to identify the Client, to give him access to their reserved area, to associate them correctly with the Professional who advised them and to give them access to their plans. Examples of such data include login credentials, but also other data such as the amount of water ingested, weight, and other information.
Location data
: with the use of the mobile application we may access information contained in the GPS of your mobile device. However, this operation is optional and must always be previously consented by the user.
Local files, notifications and other data
: on certain occasions the mobile application may access, with the Client prior consent and by their order, to local files or information stored in other applications. All these operations are optional, serving only as a way of complementing and enhancing the usefulness of the service we provide. Get to know some of the features of our application:
Notifications
: for the convenience of the Client, the Nutrium application will send notifications about their food plans, amounts of water, messages and appointments. These notifications are daily updated, automatically. This feature can be disabled at any time in the application settings.
Health Apps
: at the Client's request the Nutrium application may connect to other health applications such as Apple Health. In these cases, data on physical activity, namely, steps, distance and active calories will be collected.
Camera and Gallery
: at the Client's request, the application can access the camera and the image gallery of the mobile device, allowing the Client to take pictures and send them through message to their Professional or send images already stored in the gallery.
Automatically collected data
: in addition to the data mentioned above, we also automatically collect, through cookies and other methods and services, a set of data that allows us to know precisely how you use the platform, the country, the date and time of the login, among other information. In addition to this information we also collected other data such as the I.P. address, the browser you use to access and its version, the language, your device operating system, among others. We would like to emphasize that this type of data collection is mainly intended to facilitate the work of our team whenever you need our support. It's the collection of these groups of information that allows the quick resolution of problems on our platforms, without it we wouldn't be able to guarantee the normal operation of our service and its maintenance. For more information please check our section on how we disclose and share data with third parties (subprocessors) and our cookie policy.
7. Secretaries' Data
Like the Clients' data, Secretaries' data is also directly collected, for the most part, by the Professional. He is the controller and the main responsible for the processing of the Secretaries' personal data, and may lack consent in the context of their contractual relations to which Healthium is unrelated.
However, when using the platform, and in addition to the treatment performed on the data entered directly by the Professional, Healthium also collects some data which was already listed in relation to the Professional as "Automatically collected data", and so, we ask you to check this section.
8. Purposes of the Processing
We use the data we collect for a series of purposes that we want to make known. Those purposes may be based on a legal obligation, the legitimate interests of Healthium, the performance of the contract or consent, depending on the case.
Provision of our service
: we use the vast majority of the data entered, either by Professionals or Clients, so that we can provide our service as efficiently as possible within the contractual relationship established between Healthium and the Professional.
Maintenance and improvement of services
: we conduct behavioral analysis of the use made by the Professionals and by the Clients of the website and the mobile application. It is fundamentally this type of analysis that allows us to determine the usefulness of certain functionalities and change or correct them depending on the result. In addition, we may use your non-anonymized data in the context of the communication of a bug or error in the software by the user and always with the purpose of solving it. We can also, for example, at the request of the user, copy data between accounts.
Customer support
: it is essential for the quality of our service that we can answer efficiently to all the questions you ask us, using for that purpose any personal data that we deem necessary for the contact and resolution of the question that may arise, which may be, depending on the case, your full name, your email, your mobile phone number or your address, among other information. In addition to this data and with the same purpose, we may collect usage statistics of our platforms.
Billing
: it would be impossible for us to comply with our legal and tax obligations if we did not address the processing of some billing information. It is only for this purpose that we collect, at the time of payment, personal data such as the tax identification number, among others already listed above.
Legal matters
: we may use your personal data to comply with court orders and tax and administrative inspections, among other legal requirements. In the eventuality of a court order, all personal data, be it from a simple or special category, of the Professionals' or Clients', may be, if our legal team agrees with the legal basis of the warrant, made available in full to the administrative or judicial authority in question.
Marketing
: we may use your data to send you emails, notifications, text messages and postal mail. We will never do it, however, without your express authorization and you can freely choose not to subscribe and continue enjoying the rest of our services. In order to provide you with a tailor-made experience, the processing of such communications may be subject to automated individual decision-making, including profiling.
Security and contractual purposes
: we use your data to perform behavior analysis in order to prevent or address suspicious or fraudulent conducts and to ensure that the contractual relationship between Healthium and the Professional is timely met.
The processing of Google user data, collected in integrations such as Google Calendar and Google Fit, is used only to provide and improve the functionality of the services provided by Healthium, in accordance with the terms of the
Google Privacy Policy
.
9. Data Retention Period
Personal data may be retained for different periods of time depending on its legal relevance or the duration of the contractual relationship. In general, following the request for deletion of the user, the data is encrypted and securely stored for the same legal period required for the retention of tax data in Portugal, that is, 10 years, pursuant to Article 130 (1), of the Decree-law no. 442-B/88, with the changes introduced by Law no. 7-A/2016, of March 30, being definitively eliminated from all our servers at the end of this period.
10. Subprocessors
Some of your personal data may be processed by third parties who are not part of our services. We have limited these operations to the bare minimum we need to continue to operate efficiently. To know more about our subprocessors contact us through
privacy@nutrium.com
or
dpo@nutrium.com
or see our
Data Processing Agreement
.
Analysis of the use of software
: we resort to applications in order to analyze the use of our software, such as Google Analytics.
Payment Details
: payment data is fully processed by external payment services such as Paypal.
Email marketing
: our newsletters and contacts are sent, managed and processed by third parties specialized in mass mailing and advertising campaigns such as Mailjet.
Advertising
: we use analysis tools for marketing and advertising purposes.
Support
: we use external applications to provide support, for example, through chat.
Data storage and processing
: storage, processing and backup of your personal data is carried out securely in hosting and computing companies located mainly in Europe.
Audits and maintenance
: your data might be accessed within the scope of independent quality control and security audits of our services. All audits are subject to confidentiality and are closely monitored by the Healthium team. In addition, we use external software that helps us detect errors and debug the software.
Other processors and services
: in addition to the services listed above we may interconnect with social networks like Linkedin, Twitter, Bing and other services like Outlook, Google Fit, among others.
11. Professionals' Rights
We want to ensure that your rights are fully respected. In those situations where the automatic mechanisms already implemented do not allow us to fully guarantee these rights you can contact us through
privacy@nutrium.com
or
dpo@nutrium.com
.
Right of access
: the data subject has the right to access the information concerning him, namely the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data processed, and other information. You are already able to instantly access most of this information in your profile area.
Right to rectification
: the data subject has the right to obtain correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data, and where it is compatible with the purposes of processing, the right to rectify it. You are already able to correct and rectify most of your personal data in your profile area.
Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)
: the data subject has the right to obtain the erasure of personal data concerning him without undue delay. Starting from this request the countdown for the total and definitive deletion of the data of all the servers begins.
Right to restriction of processing and right to object
: these rights may be exercised, if applicable, by reaching us through the contacts provide above.
Right to data portability
: the data subject has the right to receive, in a reusable digital format, all information concerning him, which he has provided to Healthium.
12. Clients' Rights
We are constantly working to make the relationship between the Professional and the Client as easy as possible to expedite. As processor of the Professional, Healthium recognizes and assists the Professional in the realization of the clients' rights, as far as is technically possible and legally required, namely, by implementing the technical and administrative measures that appear to be most appropriate. For all those situations where there are no automated mechanisms for compliance with the Regulation we recommend that you contact our team or our Data Protection Officer.
We remind you that it is the responsibility of the Professional to collect the data subject consent, in the cases where the processing of the personal data is carried on that basis, as well as guarantee the rights of
access, opposition, rectification, erasure, portability and limitation of the processing of the Client data
, whenever applicable to the specific treatment, among other obligations arising from the Regulation. It is the responsibility of the Professional to guarantee the Client access to all rights and information to be provided under the General Data Protection Regulation.
13. Security
The security of your data and the services we provide are one of our highest priorities. As such, we regularly review our platforms and servers to ensure that all measures are being taken to mitigate security risks, using the most current encryption, surveillance and auditing techniques. These measures may only reflect on our servers or, otherwise, have immediate impact on our platforms, such as increased password complexity, new SSL certificates, two-step verification, and more.
14. Changes and Amendments to this Privacy Policy
Nutrium's Privacy Policy is subject to constant and periodic review. As a result of legal developments, recommendations issued by the control authorities, or changes to our business model, among others, we may have to amend this Policy.

We have made sure that this Policy is as transparent and concise as possible. It is important that you read it carefully and calmly, as the privacy we guarantee is only as complete as your knowledge of it.

Who We Are
Healthium - Healthcare Software Solutions, S.A. (hereinafter "Healthium") with head office at Rua Andrade Corvo, n.º 242, 1st floor, Room 106, postal code 4700-204 Maximinos, city of Braga, registered at the Commercial Registry Office under the single registration and legal person identification number 513 624 503, is the Data Controller for the service you are about to subscribe to.
Healthium is dedicated to developing nutrition software and services. Its mission is to make the world healthier by improving, educating, and influencing the relationship people have with nutrition through two complementary business verticals: a SaaS for nutrition professionals, and a nutritional wellness service for companies.
The first vertical, Nutrium SaaS, is a tool that allows these professionals to holistically manage their work, their clients, and their relationship with those clients, namely through a mobile application.
The second vertical, Nutrium Care, is the application of this network of nutritionists to promote well-being in companies, helping their employees to stay healthier, lose weight, improve mental and physical performance, and helping them to better manage and plan their weekly meals.
Scope of this Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all users who use Nutrium's nutritional monitoring services from a client perspective ("User"), including Nutrium Care or Nutrium Care Family users. Within the scope of these services, Healthium may be considered, in the light of the GDPR, as Co-Responsible or Responsible for the Processing of Users' personal data.
Processing Purposes and Legal Basis
The collection and processing of data is fundamental to the functioning of Nutrium's nutritional monitoring service. It is based on this data that our project is built and it is this data that allows us to provide you with a reference service, putting you in touch with the best nutritionists on the market and simplifying the booking of nutrition appointments. In this context, Healthium processes your data for the following purposes and on the following grounds:
User Registration on the Platform
: registering with Nutrium allows us to properly identify the User and correctly associate them with the desired Professionals and consultations. In addition, this is the data that we consider indispensable for the regular fulfillment not only of the contractual relationship between the User and Healthium, within the scope of the provision of this service, but also of the pre-contractual relationship between the User and the Professional that is formed with the appointment. Depending on the service, we may request the following registration data: full name, gender, country of residence and state of residence, date of birth, email address, and cell phone number, as well as the company and department to which the User is linked. The legal basis for this is the performance of the contract and Healthium's legitimate interest, in accordance with Article 6, nº 1, subparagraphs b) and f) of the GDPR.
Provision of Services
: the primary objective of the service is to allow the User to schedule remote nutrition consultations and nutritional monitoring with a Professional chosen from a list of professionals who are subscribed to the Nutrium service. In order to make this possible, Healthium provides the Professional with the User's personal data relevant to the appointment, connecting the parties and thus acting as an intermediary. In addition, within the scope of Nutrium Care and Nutrium Care Family, Healthium may process personal data related to payments and with the evaluation of activation, billing, and service success metrics. The legal basis for this is the performance of the contract and Healthium's legitimate interest, pursuant to Article 6, nº 1, subparagraphs b) and f) of the GDPR.
Sending direct communications
: Healthium may send direct communications, by email or through notifications and text messages, relating to the service provided, such as: appointment reminders; dissemination of professionals; dissemination of new services; newsletters, among other communications. The legal basis for this is Healthium's legitimate interest under the terms of Article 6, nº 1, subparagraph f) of the GDPR.
Processing, support, and analysis
: this type of data collection is mainly intended to facilitate the work of our team when you need our support and to collect information regarding the use of the platform. This is information that allows us to quickly resolve problems with our platforms or improve them, and which would otherwise not allow us to guarantee the normal functioning of our service and its maintenance. The legal basis in this regard is consent (we refer specifically to cookies) and Healthium's legitimate interest under Article 6, nº 1, subparagraph f) of the GDPR.
With regard to processing purposes that are legally based on a legitimate interest of Healthium, you can ask us to consult our Legitimate Interests Assessment at any time (only available in Portuguese and English).
The processing of Google user data, collected when the Client integrates applications such as Google Calendar and Google Fit into the Nutrium app, is used only to provide and improve the functionality of the services provided by Healthium, in accordance with the terms of the
Google Privacy Policy
.
Storage Period
Healthium will only keep your data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes defined in this Policy or for as long as required by applicable legal or regulatory standards. The User's data is kept for as long as the account is not deleted at the User's request. From that moment on, all personal data is permanently deleted.
It is important to emphasize that Healthium is totally uninvolved in the processing of personal data carried out by the Professional, so the deletion of data relating to the User's Nutrium account does not imply the simultaneous deletion of personal data processed by the Professional.
Transmission of Data to Third Parties
Some of the information you provide may be processed by third parties outside our team. We have limited this sharing to the bare minimum so that we can continue to operate efficiently and, although in many of the cases listed here there is no real transfer of data in the classic sense of the term, we provide you with a list of potential third parties and the respective categories of data to which they have access.
Nutrition professionals
: the personal data you provide us with as part of the appointment booking service is passed on to the professional so that they can manage and book appointments. The data in question is your full name, gender, country of residence, date of birth, email address, and cell phone number.
Analysis of software use
: we use applications designed to analyze the use of our software, such as Google Analytics. These applications collect small pieces of information about your mobile devices and browsers and your general use of the platform. It is therefore a set of data that allows us to know precisely how you use the platform, the country, the date and time you enter the platform, among other information. We also collect data such as your IP address, the browser you use and its version, your language, your operating system, etc.
Communications
: the mailing and management of newsletters and contacts are processed by companies external to Healthium that specialize in sending mass emails and managing advertising campaigns, such as Mailjet.
Support
: we use external applications to provide you with support, for example via chat.
Data storage and processing
: your personal data is stored, processed, and backed up securely and encrypted by hosting and computing companies located mainly in Europe.
Audits and maintenance
: your data may be accessed as part of independent audits to control the quality and security of our services. All audits are subject to confidentiality and are closely monitored by the Healthium team. We also use external software to help us detect and correct errors.
Payment processing
: to ensure certain payments, we use subcontractors who specialize in this type of operation, such as the Stripe service. In these circumstances, your payment information will be processed by these entities, which may collect additional information, such as your billing address and bank details.
Where the
transmission of personal data to third parties involves an international transfer of personal data
, Healthium:
will carry out such a transfer on the basis of an adequacy decision by the Commission, pursuant to which the country or international organization concerned guarantees a level of protection of personal data equivalent to that deriving from European Union legislation;
if there is no adequacy decision by the Commission, it will ensure that such data transfers are carried out in strict compliance with legal provisions and that adequate guarantees are implemented to ensure the protection of personal data.
Sharing with the referrer
: the User's name and photo are shared with the User who has sent an invitation to Nutrium Care Family.
Sharing with partners
: In the context of subscribing to the Nutrium Care service, whether through direct partnerships with Adhering Entities - such as employers - or indirect partnerships via benefits platforms - such as Wellhhub, Vale Saúde, Deel, among others - some of the users’ personal data may be shared with these partners. This sharing is based on Healthium’s legitimate interests and the execution of the contract, and is intended exclusively to evaluate the performance and success of the partnerships, to ensure the verification of activation and billing metrics, and to provide a more tailored and personalized service to users’ needs. The data shared may include information such as name, telephone contact, or user IDs, as well as information on registration in the program and the number of appointments carried out, strictly for the purpose of verifying the use of the service, ensuring that the identification of users is reduced to the minimum necessary for the purposes described. It should be noted that more sensitive data, such as medical records or information, may be shared exclusively in an aggregated and anonymized form, guaranteeing that it is not possible to identify users individually.
