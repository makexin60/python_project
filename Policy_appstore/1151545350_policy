8. YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND YOUR RIGHTS
Under data protection legislation you have a number of rights concerning the data we hold about you. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact our data protection representative at the contact details set out below. We have set out some additional information about these rights below:
Right of access to your personal data.
You may request access at any time to a copy of the personal data we hold about you. We will need to verify your identity in such circumstances and may request more information or clarifications from you if needed to help us locate and provide you with the personal data requested. There is usually no charge applied to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Right of restriction.
You may restrict us from processing your personal data in any of the following circumstances:
– you have contested the accuracy of the personal data we hold in relation to you or for a period of time to enable us to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
– the processing of your personal data is unlawful, and you request the restriction of use of the personal data instead of its erasure;
– we no longer require your personal data for the purpose of processing, but you require this data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
– where you have contested the processing (under Article 21(1) of the GDPR) pending the verification of our legitimate grounds.
Corrections or erasure (right to rectification and right to be forgotten).
If we hold personal data concerning you which is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or if you withdraw consent for us to process your personal data (where such processing was based on consent), you can request the deletion of this personal data. We will retain minimal personal data in order to comply with this request and in order for us to continue to use the licence granted to us by you under our Terms of Service. This right, however, will not apply where we are required to process personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation or where the processing of this information is carried out for reasons of public interest in the area of public health. If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request to have your personal information updated and corrected. To do so at any time, please contact us by email at
hello@limor.ie
.
Your right to object
. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time: – for direct marketing purposes. – for profiling to the extent it relates to direct marketing. – where we process your personal data for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by us, except where we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for this processing which would override your interests, rights and freedoms or in connection with the enforcement or defence of a legal claim. Where you object to our processing of your personal data, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes unless doing so is justified by a compelling legitimate ground as described above. For more information about our marketing practices, please see the Marketing Communications section below.
Data portability.
Where we process your personal data by automated means (i.e., not on paper) and this processing is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract between us, you have the right to request from us a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and, where technically feasible, to request that we transmit your personal data in this format to another controller.
Profiling.
Profiling is an automated form of processing of personal data often used to analyse or predict personal aspects about an individual person. This could relate to a person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. An example of this would be where a bank uses an automated credit scoring system to assess and reject a loan application. You have the right to be informed if your personal data will be subject to automated decision making, including profiling. You also have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated process, including profiling, where that decision impacts on your legal rights. There are some exceptions to this rule, where, for example, the decision is necessary in connection with the performance of a contract between us, is authorized by law or where you have given your explicit consent to this automated processing.
Account deletion.
At Limor, we prioritise your control over your data and privacy. You have the ability to delete your Limor account directly from the app, granting you the power to manage your information. To do so simply navigate to the edit profile section within the app, easily accessible via the cog icon wheel icon on your Limor profile screen. This feature has been designed to give you greater control and autonomy over your personal data. For additional information or assistance, please feel free to reach out to us at
hello@limor.ie
