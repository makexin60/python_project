Appropriate measures and procedures in the event of a Personal Data breach may differ depending on the country where it occurs, the type of breach and depending on the relevant Applicable Law.
Privacy rights related to Personal Data
As may vary based on relevant Applicable Law, Data Subjects have rights related to their Personal Data, such as the right to request access, rectification, erasure of their Personal Data, restriction of processing, object to processing, request data portability, to be informed and withdraw their consent for processing of Personal Data based on their consent. Data Subjects may also object to automated individual decision-making if they are concerned by such processing.
In addition, in some jurisdictions you may provide instructions relating to the retention, communication and erasure of your Personal Data posthumously.
The exercise of such rights is not absolute and is subject to the limitations provided by Applicable Law.
Data Subjects may have the right to lodge a complaint with the local supervisory authority or the competent regulator if they consider that the processing of their Personal Data infringes Applicable Law.
To exercise those privacy rights, Data Subjects may contact us as described in the section “How to contact us” below. We may ask proof of identity in order to respond to the request. If we can’t satisfy your request (refusal or limitation), we will motivate our decision in writing.
Updates to this Policy
If necessary, we may from time to time need to update this Policy in order to reflect new or different privacy practices. In this case, we will post updated versions of this Policy on this page. A revised Policy will apply only to data collected subsequent to its effective date. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
