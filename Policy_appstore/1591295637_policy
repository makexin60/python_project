This includes data that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, email address, and any other information you provide during the registration process. Additionally, the HRM App may collect data related to your heart rate, health metrics, and other physiological information that you input into the app.
Non-Personal Information:
This includes information that does not directly identify you. We may collect data such as device type, operating system, app usage patterns, and other technical details to help us improve our services.
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
To Provide Services:
Your personal information is used to deliver the core functionalities of the HRM App, including heart rate monitoring, data analysis, and personalized health insights.

Non-personal information is used to optimize and enhance the app's performance, troubleshoot issues, and understand user preferences.

We may use your contact information to send important updates, respond to inquiries, or provide support.
Your privacy is important to us, and we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except in the following cases:
Service Providers:
We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the app, conducting business, or providing services to you. These parties are obligated to keep your information confidential.
Legal Requirements:
We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
We implement a variety of security measures to protect your personal information. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information stored within the HRM App. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us directly. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable laws.
We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Once your data is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.
The HRM App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently gathered data from a child, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted within the app, and we encourage you to review the policy periodically. Your continued use of the HRM App after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
