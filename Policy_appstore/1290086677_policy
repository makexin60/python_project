We rely on consent for certain use of      certain Cookies, the combination of data across devices, and international      transfers of personal information. For more information on how you can      provide or withdraw your consent, see Section V. (Your Choices).
We limit when we disclose the information we collect from minors, under the following circumstances:

Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of Services. In some jurisdictions, minors may also exercise their data protection rights directly.
VIII. HOW WE SECURE AND HOW LONG WE STORE INFORMATION
We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, organizational, and procedural safeguards to protect your information. While we take reasonable precautions against possible loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, no storage system or transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. Data we collect will be retained only for so long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

You understand that some of these countries, including the United States, may not provide the same level of data privacy protection as in the European Union/European Economic Area or your home country. We will transfer your personal information where necessary to provide the Services and perform the contract you entered into with us.  If we need to transfer your personal data to another country that may not provide the same level of privacy protection as in your home country, we will apply necessary safeguards and security measures regarding transfers, as required by applicable law.  Where applicable data protection law provides for the use of EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses or other transfer agreements to lawfully transfer data abroad, we generally rely on such clauses for our transfers unless other transfer grounds are more appropriate. Depending on applicable law, you may ask for a copy or information about these transfer mechanisms by contacting us at the contact details below.

We also utilize Keywords for management of the support service. As mentioned, Embark and the suppliers have entered into a data processing agreement, ensuring that your data is only being processed on behalf of Embark and according to the information above.

For the avoidance of doubt, Embark will not sell your personal data, use it to market any products not distributed by Embark or communicate with you in a manner that is contrary to your preferences as communicated by you.

A quick summary of how your inquiry will be handled:
As you’re likely aware, the purpose of this form is to help make it easier for you to get in touch with non-EU and/or non-UK organizations that process your personal data. Given that, any data you submit on this form will be transferred to the foreign organization that you identify in the “Name of the organization that your inquiry relates to” field, above, with the aim of helping resolve your concern. Note that you likely won’t hear any response to your inquiry from VeraSafe directly. Unless the foreign organization specifically authorizes us to respond to you directly, the foreign organization will be fully responsible for handling your inquiry on their own, without any involvement from VeraSafe. In our role as a representative working on behalf of foreign organizations, we can facilitate communication between you and the foreign organization but we don’t have any way to resolve your inquiry ourselves. We want to help you, but we have no power to force any foreign organization to respond to your inquiry, even if we (you and us) both think they should.
Since VeraSafe has a legal obligation to relay your inquiry to the foreign organization you identify above, your rights to request that we not use your data for this purpose are quite limited. Likewise, please be aware that we have a legal obligation to document how we handle your inquiries, which may prevent us from erasing your personal data upon your request. If you do not want VeraSafe to process your personal data, you must not submit such personal data to us in any way. You can always direct your concern to the foreign organization directly (instead of VeraSafe), and you have no obligation to send your inquiry to VeraSafe.
