This Privacy Policy discloses the practices of Smalltalk Group Ltd. (d/b/a “Smalltalk”) concerning information we obtain by and through your use of the Getsmalltalk.com website (the “Site”) our Smalltalk mobile application (the “Application”) and the services offered through either the Site or the Application (the “Services”).
Smalltalk is committed to respecting your privacy and recognising your need for appropriate protection and management of Personally Identifiable Information you share with us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the types of information Smalltalk obtains about visitors to our Site and users of our Application and Services, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information.

A. What information we collect
The information we collect on our Site and through the use of our Services or Application generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. If we do combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
(1) Personally Identifiable Information
“Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Smalltalk collects and stores personally identifiable information that you provide to us. The Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include: your name, date of birth, e-mail address, login name, passwords, etc. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you register on the Site or through the Application.
(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information
“Non-Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. This can be can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our Site may include: your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address; “cookies” or small text files that collect information about our activity on our Site, including the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, which URL you go to next, which browser you used to come to our Site, and any search terms entered on our Site. More information about Cookies appears below.
We may also collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the form of demographic information, such as your gender, age and interest. We use this information to provide you with personalised services and information that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also collect, analyse and use aggregated and anonymised information about you for market research.
Your use of the Application may also include collection of information from your mobile device. For example, the Application may request your permission to collect location data and/or may request access to multimedia (photos or videos) stored on your mobile device.
