Privacy Policy for
TattArt: AI Tattoo Generator
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the
TattArt: AI Tattoo Generator
mobile application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
1. Data Collection
We do not collect any personal data from users. The only information processed by the App is the prompt you provide when generating a tattoo, which is sent to a third-party service for tattoo creation. Additionally, if you choose to use the App's free, ad-supported feature, we may use third-party advertising services that may collect non-personal information for advertising purposes.
2. Use of Data
We do not use or store any of the data you provide. The App simply sends your prompt to a third-party API for tattoo generation and does not retain any of your data after the tattoo is generated. If you choose to watch ads to generate a tattoo, the ad network may collect non-personal information related to your ad interactions, such as device identifiers and browsing behavior.
3. Third-Party Services
The App uses third-party API services to generate tattoos based on the prompts you submit. Additionally, third-party advertising services may be used to display ads when you access the free, ad-supported version of the App. These third-party services may have their own privacy practices, and we recommend reviewing their privacy policies.
4. Data Retention
We do not retain any user data. Once the tattoo is generated and returned to you, no data is stored or kept by the App.
5. User Rights
Since we do not collect any personal data, there are no rights for users to access, modify, or delete their data, as no personal information is collected.
6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We do not use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect any information. However, third-party advertising services may use cookies or similar technologies to track user interactions with ads.
7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from users under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will take steps to delete it immediately.
8. Changes to Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you within the App or through other appropriate means.
