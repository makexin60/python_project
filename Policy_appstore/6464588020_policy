TYPES OF COOKIES WE USE
a)
Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential for you to browse our Site and use its features; without these necessary cookies, our Site would not be able to operate.

If a user disables necessary cookies, that user will not be able to get to all of the content that a subscription entitles them to.

Functional Cookies: These cookies are used to remember the selections you make on our Site so that your selections are saved for your next visits.
c)
Analytical Cookies: These cookies are used to analyze a user’s journey through our Site and to monitor performance of our Site. These cookies only provide anonymized information that does not identify anybody personally. This information is then bundled with the similar information from the other users, so that we can analyze the general usage patterns.

Advertising Cookies: These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests.

Tracking pixels: These are used to implement tracking technology on our Site.

Third Party Cookies: These cookies are created by a website other than ours and are used to improve and monitor our Site’s performance, so you receive a better service.
