To help manage your account and activity, there are two options in the My Profile section.
Break Time
(Play Responsibly)
:
This gives you the option to pause your purchase and draw entry activities between specific dates. To reactivate your account, simply wait until the expiry of the dates you previously entered or contact our customer support team who can reactivate your account for you
Delete Account
(Account & Security):
This allows you to delete your account from our system. The system will initially disable your account for 30 days. If you do nothing, then the system will then automatically delete your account.
If during the 30-day period you change your mind, please call our Customer Service Centre on +971 4 356 2424, and the team will be able to reactivate your account.
Once done, the deletion is irreversible, and you will lose all credits in your Player Balance. The only way to purchase and play again is to create a new account with a different email address.

Your privacy rights and how to exercise them
The right to know and to portability
You have the right to request that We disclose to You:
the categories and sources of the personal information that We collect about You, the purposes for which We use Your information and with whom such information is shared;
in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists where We disclose:
for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient; and
for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category of recipient.
The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.
If We deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable You to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance, provided that this is technically feasible.
The right to request the deletion of Your personal information
You have the right to request that We delete any of Your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Platform, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).
If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising Your right, We will delete your personal information and direct any of Our service providers to do so.
How to exercise Your rights
To exercise the rights described above, You need to submit Your verifiable request to Us by contacting Us via the contact details provided at the beginning of this document.
For Us to respond to Your request, it is necessary that We know who You are. Therefore, You can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:
provide sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify You are the person about whom We collected personal information or an authorised representative;
describe Your request with sufficient detail that allows Us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will not respond to any request if We are unable to verify Your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in Our possession actually relates to You.
If You are an adult, You can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under Your parental authority.
You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
How and when We are expected to handle Your request
We will confirm receipt of Your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how We will process Your request.
We will respond to Your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should We need more time, We will explain to You the reasons why, and how much more time We need. In this regard, please note that We may take up to 90 days to fulfil Your request.
Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.
Should We deny Your request, We will explain to You the reasons behind Our denial.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to Your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, We may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, We will communicate Our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
