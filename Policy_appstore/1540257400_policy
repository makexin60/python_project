Information that you provide to us
About the face data collecting: We do not collect any face data or user photos. My app provides functionality for users to create a funny sticker from their faces. Users can stitch faces into our drawings to create a fun sticker. Users can then share or use them in iMessage. We do not save this data on the server or send it to any 3rd party. When you first use the face recognition function, You may voluntarily grant us permission to access your camera and album to obtain your facial photo in your mobile device. Only if you confirm the permission, will we gain access to your camera and album?
