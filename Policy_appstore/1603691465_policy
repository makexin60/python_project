Privacy Policy
edays, a trading name of edays Absence Management Limited and its affiliated companies, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.  We aim to comply fully with UK, EU and other applicable data privacy laws around the world where we do business.  This Privacy Policy applies to all personal data that we collect, disclose, store, use, and/or process from visitors to our website, prospective customers, our customers and end users of our customers who use our applications.
Keeping the data stored by edays safe is our highest priority and we work hard to ensure we do. We have put in place extensive security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, or third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so. The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure; this risk is not specific to our services and is common across the internet. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the security of the transmission of the data to us which is outside our control; any data you send is at your own risk.
It is important that you read this Privacy Policy together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.
This policy is split into three sections, each describing our practices regarding specific types of data subject
