3. USE OF CAR:GO APPLICATION AFTER REGISTERING
In order to be able to connect with Service Providers, through CAR:GO Application,
					after becoming a member of the CAR:GO Association and registering, but before sending a request for
					any of the services (hereinafter: Request), it is necessary to enter data from your payment card and
					select the desired payment option. The method of payment and the card remain stored on the CAR:GO
					Application as long as you have a user account. You can add a new card and/or remove an existing one
					at any time. After selecting the desired payment option, set your starting location, i.e., the exact
					address where you are and where you want to start using the Services (hereinafter: Home Location).
					If you have any doubts about your location, you can use another appropriate option - call the
					Service Provider.
CAR:GO Services Distinctions
Just before you choose an end destination for your CAR:GO Services, you also have the option of
					choosing the type of service - MINI, ECO (Economy & Ecology class), BIZ or a service adapted for
					people with disabilities.
Since the safety of you and your youngest is our priority, if you need a service that includes the
					use of child seats, you need to opt for the ECO type of service. Also, as a company with a
					pet-friendly work policy, we have enabled you to use the CAR:GO Service together with your pets if
					you decide for the MINI type of service. After entering your start location and the end point at
					which you want to end your use of the Services (hereinafter: Final Destination), based on the
					information provided, you will be provided with an estimate of the CAR:GO Application Fee. After
					that, if you want to continue with your Request for CAR:GO Services, you need to select the option
					to confirm your Request.
After confirming your Request, you will be connected with our Service Provider who is closest to you,
					in that way completing your Request, and you will be able to track the Service Provider while
					arriving to your location via the CAR:GO Application, notifying you how long it takes for the
					Service Provider to arrive. Selecting the confirmation option at the same time means that you are
					concluding a Service Provision Agreement with the Service Provider, of which you will be provided
					with the exact details via CAR:GO Application. Without any doubt, you are entering into a Service
					Provision Agreement directly with the Service Provider and not with DNP GO TECHNOLOGIES. You
					acknowledge
					and agree that DNP GO TECHNOLOGIES is not and cannot be a party to the contract. Since, when using
					the
					application, the software monitors the GPS geolocation of your mobile device and collects data
					regarding your current location, you are confirming that by accepting these Terms of Use you agree
					that your device must provide data regarding your geolocation in order to provide CAR:GO Services,
					which will be available in the CAR:GO Application and visible to Service Providers after logging in
					to your user account. By accepting these Terms of Use, you agree that this data is collected and
					used exclusively for the purposes of functioning of CAR:GO Application, or the provision of
					Services. After you have finished using the CAR:GO Service, you will receive a notification on your
					phone about the successful completion of the provided CAR:GO Service by the Service Provider.
You have an option to cancel the ordered CAR:GO Service at any time. In case you cancel
					the CAR:GO Service after 15 seconds starting from the moment the Service Provider accepted your
					request, you will be charged a
					Cancellation Fee 495.00 RSD. If you
					cancel the CAR:GO Service at any time before the Service Provider accepts your
					request, or before the expiration of 15 seconds starting from the moment the Service Provider
					accepted your request, you will not be charged the Cancellation Fee. The service you requested will
					be automatically cancelled and you will be charged the Cancellation Fee of 495.00 RSD
					if you do not appear at the Home Location within 15 minutes starting from the
					moment the Service Provider came to the Home Location (automatic service cancellation). The
					Cancellation Fee is charged for the time and effort the Service Provider spends getting to the Home
					Location and waiting for you at the Home Location, that is as a compensation for the costs Service Providers incurred
					getting to the Home Location of the Service User and/or waiting for the Service User at the Home Location.
					In other words, the CAR:GO Service Cancellation Fee is charged because the Service User did not (timely)
					appear at the designated location, thereby permanently preventing the Service Provider from providing the
					CAR:GO Service in accordance with the concluded contract.
We also offer Service Users the opportunity to evaluate Service Providers after the provision of
					CAR:GO Services has been completed. You rate the service provider in the range of one to five stars,
					according to how satisfied you are with the provided CAR:GO Service. If you have decided that you
					want to give your rating, you must provide accurate feedback, based on your objective view of the
					quality of the provided CAR:GO Service. Positive ratings help you as Service Users in choosing a
					Service Provider, and the goal of this evaluation is mutual correction, to help us improve and
					better CAR:GO Services, but also to monitor the quality of services provided to you as Service
					Users.
In addition, we enable Service Providers with low ratings and thus protect you as Service Users.
					After you have evaluated the CAR:GO Service provided by the Service Provider, a notification will be
					sent to your e-mail address stating the exact amount of money deducted from your payment card.
Liabilities of Service Users
