This cookie policy explains and describes what cookies are and how Amuse employs such cookies and other related technologies. This helps us improve your experience with our Service.
11. What are cookies?
Cookies (unfortunately not those tasty things with chocolate chips, but rather, internet cookies) are text files with small pieces of data that are used to identify your computer when you visit a website. For example, think of when you access a website and your username and password are auto-filled; cookies provide that login information to the website. Cookies help websites recognize your device and remember certain information about your preferences or actions. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide certain information to the website owner. For more information about cookies, check out

12.2 Other technologies
Pixel tags/web beacons:
Sometimes we may use pixel tags (also known as clear GIFS or web beacons). Pixel tags are tiny, invisible graphics or code snippets embedded in a web page. The pixel tags are placed on certain web pages and when you access those web pages, the pixel tag generates a generic notice of the visit and permits us to set or read our cookies. They are used together with cookies to track activity on a site by a particular device. If you turn off cookies, we can only see anonymous website visits.
Mobile device identifiers (MDI) and software development kits (SDK):
We may also use or partner with app developer platforms that use mobile software development kits (SDK) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) but also information about how mobile devices interact with our Service.
MDI are unique alphanumeric strings assigned to your mobile device which helps us to recognize and distinguish your device from another.
SDKs are collections of software tools and libraries used to develop and enhance our mobile applications.

You have the option to accept or reject cookies, delete existing cookies, or set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent.
