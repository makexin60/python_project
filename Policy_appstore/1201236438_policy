Seems badly developed
Tapping on the bottom tabs opens diferent views. But tapping on the same tab multiple times adds adds views where all are the same. Using the swipe gesture on iphone is enabled and doing so you can see how many times you've opened that page because you can keep swiping through them this way.
Simple if check to see if you are already on that view would have fixed that.
Poor effort

Major Fault with slow resolution
On a couple of occasions this App has wiped all my bets, including winning ones. Getting a resolution is slow and tedious. Boylesports have to call BGT and wait for them to call back, I’ve been waiting 3 days for my current issue to be resolved.
I would avoid this App until this is sorted.

Sorry to hear about your experience. A fix, including work on the history section, has now been released and this issue should be resolved.
