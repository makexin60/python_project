What information do we collect?
During registration, we collect the month and year of a child’s birth to infer their age in order to set the initial exercise difficulty level. We also collect this information for research purposes. To avoid privacy concerns, we do not collect the exact date of birth.
We also collect anonymous puzzle performance information, such as how long it takes users to solve puzzles, or how many correct / incorrect answers they get. This information helps us fine-tune our puzzle design process. For example, a large number of mistakes in a particular puzzle may be an indication that the puzzle may need to be redesigned or moved up in a difficulty level. Similarly, a puzzle that was solved instantly is probably too easy and has to be moved down in its difficulty level.
Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties any personally identifiable information. ImagiRation’s ongoing development has a vital research component. Analyzed data may be published in research journal papers or conference proceedings. All published data is completely anonymous such that no individual may be directly or indirectly identified.
