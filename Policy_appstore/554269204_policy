Privacy Policy
Our business is to encrypt and secure your communications. We take
this very seriously. The protection of your team's communications is
what we do best.
Accepting payments may require us to collect very basic customer data
such as email addresses and card information. This payment information
is only shared with our payment processor, and only to complete the
transaction required to get your team access to Silent Circle
services. We want to hold the least amount of data as possible.
You may notice that the pages on our main website pull in Javascript
files from a third party. This allows us to better understand the
effectiveness of certain web pages, and helps us make information
easier to find for our enterprise customers. In discussions with the
third party, we are convinced that the information being used is the
minimum possible, and that it is being managed with appropriate care.
We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.
As a Silent Circle customer, you trust us with your most protected
data and deserve exceptionally high quality service in return. Your
trust is a privilege that we work to earn every day with a relentless
focus on security, simplicity, and service.
