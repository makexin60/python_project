Lawful Basis
Legitimate Interest
means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
Performance of Contract
means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
Comply with a legal obligation
means processing your Personal Information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
Third Parties
Internal Third Parties
mean other affiliates of our Company acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the United States and provide IT and system administration services and undertake reporting.
External Third Parties
mean:
Service providers acting as processors based in the United States who provide IT and system administration services.
Professional advisers including attorneys, bankers, auditors, and insurers based in the United States who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services.

Payment processing companies based in the United States who provide credit card processing services.
Your Legal Rights
You have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”)
This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information
You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Information in cases where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party
If you request the transfer of your Personal Information we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent
You may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.Privacy Policy / Disclosure

Glossary
Lawful Basis
Legitimate Interest
means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
Performance of Contract
means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
Comply with a legal obligation
means processing your Personal Information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
Third Parties
Internal Third Parties
mean other affiliates of our Company acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the United States and provide IT and system administration services and undertake reporting.
External Third Parties
mean:
Service providers acting as processors based in the United States who provide IT and system administration services.
Professional advisers including attorneys, bankers, auditors, and insurers based in the United States who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services.
Marketing providers, including public relations specialists, advertisers, and sales people.
Payment processing companies based in the United States who provide credit card processing services.
Your Legal Rights
You have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”)
This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information
You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Information in cases where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party
If you request the transfer of your Personal Information we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent
You may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Emailing us at
privacy@babylonbee.com

privacy@babylonbee.com
.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
For instructions on exercising your sale opt-out or opt-in rights, see “
Personal Information Sales and Sharing Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
.”
Response Timing and Format
We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days.  If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact

If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee reflecting the administrative costs involved if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request and notify you of the reason in these circumstance.
Personal Information Sales and Sharing Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights

Nevertheless, such security measures may not prevent all loss, misuse, or alteration of information on the Site, and Babylon Bee is not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such security failures. By using the Site, you understand that there is a risk that data and communications, including email and other electronic communications, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information, to the extent possible, in public areas of the Site. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Site. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. The foregoing does not affect any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications in an effort to build users’ trust and confidence in the internet and Site use by providing simple and secure access and communication of Personal Information. Further, we may use payment processing companies based in the United States who provide credit card processing services.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Transfer of Information to the United States
We are a global business that operates and provides products and Services to customers located in many different countries around the world. The global nature of our business means that your Personal Information may well be transferred across national boundaries, including, potentially, to countries that do not require organizations by law to look after your Personal Information in the way in which you have come to expect in your own country.
This Site is headquartered and operated in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be processed in the United States. The United States has received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the General Data Processing Regulation (GDPR) pursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. The Company relies on certain derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR. In particular, we collect and transfer to the United States Personal Information only: with your consent, to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of the Company that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and to use it only consistent with your relationship with the Company and the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We may also enter into data processing agreements and model clauses with our vendors whenever feasible and appropriate.
Children’s Privacy
You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase any products or Services offered by us through the Site. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under age 18, do not use or provide any information on this Site or through any of its features, register on the Site, make any purchases on the Site, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or username you may use. If we become aware that a user is under the age of 18 and has registered or otherwise provided Personal Information to us, we will cancel the corresponding registration and delete such information from our records. California residents under 16 years of age may have additional rights regarding the collection and sale of their Personal Information. For more information, please review our

Glossary
Lawful Basis
Legitimate Interest
means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
Performance of Contract
means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
Comply with a legal obligation
means processing your Personal Information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
Third Parties
Internal Third Parties
mean other affiliates of our Company acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the United States and provide IT and system administration services and undertake reporting.
External Third Parties
mean:
Service providers acting as processors based in the United States who provide IT and system administration services.
Professional advisers including attorneys, bankers, auditors, and insurers based in the United States who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services.
Marketing providers, including public relations specialists, advertisers, and sales people.
Payment processing companies based in the United States who provide credit card processing services.
Your Legal Rights
You have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”)
This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information
You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Information in cases where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party
If you request the transfer of your Personal Information we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent
You may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
