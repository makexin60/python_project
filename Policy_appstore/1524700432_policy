Our Fair Use Policy has been created to prevent improper use of SiteScape software, so we can offer all our customers an excellent user experience. The Fair Use Policy for our SaaS solution includes user access, data processing, storage, and sharing. Each SiteScape license is to be used by one person only, and reasonable amounts of data creation for a single person, and is not to be shared with any other user. To determine the scope of Fair Use we take into account your license against the usage typical across the universe of accounts. When we detect out-of-the-ordinary levels of usage in your SiteScape account, we’ll contact you to discuss the situation and potential alternatives. If usage does not come into compliance with our policy, we reserve the right to limit your account or terminate your license and access to the system.

‍
Certain features of the Service may permit users to generate or post content, including messages, reviews, video, scans, folders, data, text, photographs, images, and data gathered by a mobile device (“User Content”). You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that User Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.To provide our Service, we do require a license to your User Content, so that we can store your data on our servers, process it, and transmit it to you: when you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you hereby grant to SiteScape (and those we work with) a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, store, reproduce, process, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your User Content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating and improving our Services, and to develop new products and services. This license continues even if you stop using our Services.Why do we need these rights? The following situations are a few examples of where we would need these rights: In order to receive your uploaded scans, we need the right to store and transmit the data.We need the rights to store, transmit, process, modify the user content (scans) in order to post-process the scan data to improve scan quality and usability. If you would like to see the resulting scans and share them with people you have selected using SiteScape, we need the rights to transmit, display and distribute your user content. Again - since you own the Intellectual Property of the data, that means we can’t share or distribute this data without your permission, and we need this permission in order to provide the service to you.
