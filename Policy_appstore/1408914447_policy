4. State Privacy Rights

Right to Delete.
You may submit a request that Gemini delete the Personal Information about you that we have collected from you. Note that there are some reasons we will not be able to fully address your request, such as if we need to complete a transaction for you, to detect and protect against fraudulent and illegal activity to exercise our rights, for our internal purposes, or to comply with a legal obligation.
Right to Correct.
You may submit a request that Gemini correct inaccurate Personal Information that we may maintain about you, subject to appropriate verification.
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.

privacy@gemini.com
.
Please note that, where permitted under applicable law, we may decline a request if we are unable to verify your identity (or an agent’s authority to make the request) and confirm the Personal Information we maintain relates to you.
Please understand that we are not obligated to provide you with access to your Personal Information more than twice in a 12-month period. If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may either charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request in which case we will notify you of the reason for refusing the request.
5. How to Submit a Request
You may submit a request to access, delete, or correct your Personal Information by emailing us at
privacy@gemini.com
. Submitting a request to access, delete, or correct does not require you to create an account with us. We are legally obligated to verify your identity when you submit a request. We may request additional information from you, like your date of birth or a personal identification number, to verify your identity. Gemini will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days and will respond to your request within 45 calendar days, after proper verification, unless we need additional time, in which case we will let you know.  If you submit a request to delete your Personal Information, you will also be required to confirm the deletion request by email.
6. Opt-Out Requests
You may request to opt out of the "sale" or "share" of your Personal Information (as these terms are defined under applicable law) at any time by clicking the "Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information" link  at the bottom of the website's homepage, or by emailing us at privacy@gemini.com.
Alternatively, you can use certain preference signals to exercise your sale and sharing opt-out right automatically with all businesses that you interact with online, including Gemini. If you enable Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each browser or profile.
7. Agent Requests
You may designate an authorized agent to make a privacy rights request on your behalf. Authorized agents will need to demonstrate that you’ve authorized them to act on your behalf or must demonstrate they have power of attorney pursuant to applicable probate law. Gemini retains the right to request confirmation directly from you confirming that the agent is authorized to make such a request, or to request additional information to confirm the agent’s identity. An authorized agent is prohibited from using a consumer’s Personal Information, or any information collected from or about the consumer, for any purpose other than to fulfill the consumer’s requests, for verification, or for fraud prevention.
Submitting an opt-out request does not require you to create an account with us.
8. Notice of Financial Incentive
We may offer financial incentives to promote our products and services. For example, for every friend or family member you refer to Gemini, you both will earn $15 in the crypto of your choice once your friend trades $100 within 30 days of sign-up. You can earn up to $600 a year in free crypto rewards when you refer friends to Gemini. Please click
here
to learn more about this program.
We may use Personal Information in connection with these promotions, including the following Personal Information collected at the time of account opening: name, email address, and phone number. Because these promotions involve the collection of Personal Information, they may be interpreted as “financial incentive” programs under California law. Participation in any financial incentive is optional. You may withdraw from the program at any time by emailing
support@gemini.com
.
The value of any financial incentive we offer is reasonably related to the value of any Personal Information you provide to us. We estimate the value of your Personal Information by considering, without limitation, the expenses we incur from collecting your Personal Information and/or providing the financial incentive to you, the revenue generated by your use of the financial incentive, and any improvements we can make to our products and services based on aggregating information obtained through the financial incentive program.
Please note that we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive. If applicable, those terms will be presented to you at sign up.

We share your personal data with these processors only so that they can provide us with services, and we prohibit our processors from using or disclosing your personal data for any other purpose.

When we transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, to a third country which has not been determined by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data (such as the USA), we ensure appropriate safeguards are implemented.

Measures we take include encryption of the Gemini website communications with SSL; required two-factor authentication for all sessions; periodic review of our personal data collection, storage, and processing practices; and restricted access to your personal data on a need-to-know basis for our employees, contractors and agents who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
7. Data Retention
We take reasonable and practicable steps to ensure your personal data is not kept longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which it is to be processed.
