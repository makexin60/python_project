Therefore, you will continue to receive B2B related marketing messages.
14.
Can business customers subscribe to DNC?
Organisations may register their Singapore telephone numbers with the DNC Registry. Telemarketers would have to exclude contacting and/or messaging these registered numbers.

Only the account-holder or subscriber of the telephone line should register the telephone number with the DNC Registry. Where the account-holder or subscriber of the telephone line is the organisation and not the employee, employees should seek permission of the organisation if they wish to register their business numbers.
1.
Why do you collect my NRIC when I subscribe to a phone line?
In order to provide certain telecommunication services, telecommunications service providers are required under the SBO or FBO licence to maintain records that include the NRIC numbers, Foreign Identification Numbers or passport numbers of their subscribers. Singtel is required to obtain the information contained in your NRIC to comply with the license conditions. For further details, you can refer to the PDPC
website
.
2.
Why are you insisting on verifying my NRIC even though there are new NRIC rules?
The new NRIC guidelines allow organizations to verify an individual’s identity using the NRIC number. For account-specific requests, the IMDA has also set out guidelines in relation to telcos who need to verify the customer’s identity using the NRIC number. For further details, you can refer to guidelines for subscriber verification process in the IMDA
website
.
3.
Why must you verify my NRIC instead of any other particulars?
The IMDA has also set out guidelines in relation to telcos who need to verify the customer’s identity using the NRIC number. Therefore, telcos will generally make use of a combination of NRIC and subscriber-unique information e.g. how did you pay your last bill, other active services subscribed. For further details, you can refer to guidelines for subscriber verification process in the IMDA
website
