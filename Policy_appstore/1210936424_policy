Townsquare Media Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Company" "us," "we," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of Personal Data (i.e., information reasonably related to a specific individual). This Privacy Notice describes how we process Personal Data collected through our websites, social media accounts, mobile applications, and other online interactions and communications such as email (collectively, our “Digital Properties”); in-person events and purchases; and other online and offline interactions.
This Privacy Notice applies to information we collect about individual consumers, such as general website visitors (“Individuals”) as well as information we collect about the personnel of our business partners, including vendors and business customers, in business-to-business interactions (“Business Contacts”).

Whenever you interact with us on behalf of another individual or entity, such as if you refer a friend to us, you must obtain their consent (or have the legal authority without consent) to share their Personal Data with us.

Types of cookies and tracking technologies we use
We and the third parties that we authorize may use the following tracking technologies:
Cookies

Pixels, web beacons, and tags
, which are types of code or transparent graphics. In addition to the uses described below, these technologies provide analytical information about the user experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on web pages.
Session replay tools
, which record your interactions with our Digital Properties, such as how you move throughout our Digital Properties and engage with our webforms. In addition to the uses described below, this information helps us improve our Digital Properties and identify and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Digital Properties.
Embedded scripts and SDKs
, which allow us to build and integrate custom apps and experiences on our Digital Properties
Purposes for using these technologies
We and authorized third parties use these technologies for purposes including:
Personalization
, such as remembering language preferences and pages and products you have viewed in order to enhance and personalize your experience when you visit our Digital Properties;
Improvement
, such as maintaining and improving the performance of our Digital Properties and improving the user experience;
Analytics
, such as analyzing how our websites are used and creating insights. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us improve the user experience. Google Analytics may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps” located at
https://google.com/policies/privacy/partners
;
Advertising
, such as conducting advertising and content personalization on our Digital Properties and those of third parties; tracking activity over time and across properties to develop a profile of your interests and advertise to you based on those interests (“interest-based advertising”); providing you with offers and online content that may be of interest to you; optimizing advertising campaigns; and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and our communications with you, including identifying how and when you engage with one of our emails; and
Security
, such as preventing fraud and malicious behavior.
Information Collected
These tracking technologies collect data about you and your device, such as your IP address, name of your Internet service provider, device type, location (both approximate and precise), cookie ID, device ID, ad ID, operating system, browser used, referring domain, browsing history, search history, and information about how you interact with our Digital Properties (such as pages on our Digital Properties that you have viewed).
Disclosures of your information

6. Your choices
Marketing emails
You can unsubscribe to our email marketing via the link in the email or by managing your preferences here:
https://www.townsquaremedia.com/privacy-preferences
. You may continue to receive service-related, legal, and other important communications from us even after you have unsubscribed from email marketing.
Text messages
When you have provided authorization, we may deliver SMS text messages, push notifications, and voice message notifications, including promotional messages. You are not required to receive such messages as a condition of purchasing any goods or services from us, and you may choose not to receive text messages from us by not providing us your cell phone number. Please note that standard message rates and data charges from your cellular service provider apply to sending and/or receiving text messages. You are solely responsible for such message rates and data charges.
Cookies and tracking technologies
Some of the third parties we work with participate with the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). The DAA and NAI provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at
https://www.aboutads.info/choices/
and
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
. We adhere to the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may also click on the AboutAds icon on a Company advertisement and follow the instructions on how to opt out.
You can also refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our Digital Properties' functionality may be impaired. Please refer to your browser's Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies. If you change computers, devices, or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or browsers; or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from participating parties.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. At this time, we do not honor Do Not Track signals.
7. Data Security and Data Retention
Although we maintain reasonable security safeguards, no security measures or communications over the Internet can be 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.
Your Personal Data will be retained as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we have outlined above unless we are required to do otherwise by applicable law. This includes retaining your Personal Data to provide you with the products or services you have requested and interact with you; complete your transaction; maintain our business relationship with you; improve our business over time; ensure the ongoing legality, safety and security of our services and relationships; or otherwise in accordance with our internal retention procedures. Once you have terminated your relationship with us, we may retain your Personal Data in our systems and records in order to ensure adequate fulfillment of surviving provisions in terminated contracts or for other legitimate business purposes, such as to enable easier future onboarding, demonstrate our business practices and contractual obligations, or provide you with information about our products and services in case of interest.

Our Digital Properties are intended for individuals 18 years of age and older. The Digital Properties are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, children under 18 years of age.

If you believe that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 18, please contact us at the address in Section 10 (Contact Information) below, and we will take prompt steps to delete the information.

Our Digital Properties may contain links to external sites or other online services that we do not control, including those embedded in third party advertisements or sponsor information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or data collection policies of such third-party services. You should consult the privacy notices of those third-party services for details on their practices

Google Product Privacy Guide
How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
