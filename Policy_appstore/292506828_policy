The BE Policy applies to all OCBC Bank offices where they conduct regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Act (“SFA”) or their staff are appointed representatives under the SFA, and excludes subsidiaries of OCBC Bank.
The BE Policy will set the guiding principles for OCBC Bank’s best execution processes. In case of conflicts or inconsistencies, local regulatory requirements would prevail.
Governance & Management Supervision
We will monitor best execution arrangements on an on-going basis (at least annually) to identify and implement any appropriate enhancements.
OCBC Bank reserves the right to amend this document from time to time as it deems necessary. Any material changes to the BE Policy shall be updated here.
Applicability of best execution
This document applies with respect to all financial instruments within the scope of “best execution” as prescribed by the regulators in the locations we operate.
We have in place a policy and framework which are designed for OCBC Bank to try deliver the best possible execution for our clients, subject to the financial instrument and taking into account the nature of the client’s orders, the execution venues available for such financial instruments and the priorities the client places upon us to execute those orders. While OCBC Bank will take all reasonable steps to achieve best execution, OCBC Bank does not guarantee that it will be able to achieve best execution for every transaction or confirm that every transaction will be executed in full.
Policy requirements
OCBC Bank shall take into account the following factors when executing your order:
Price;
Costs;
Speed;
Likelihood of execution;
Likelihood of settlement;
Size of the order(s);
Nature of the order(s);
Other aspects of the order(s).
Notwithstanding this, there are certain situations in which these factors will change. These may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Type of order;
Type of product;
Specific instructions that the customer provides;
General prevailing conditions in the market at the time of the order.
Specific instructions
Where specific instructions are given by you regarding the execution of an order or a part of the order, OCBC Bank will ensure to execute your order in accordance with those instructions. In this circumstance, OCBC Bank will consider itself as having satisfied its best execution obligations with respect to the part of your order to which the instruction relates, when those instructions have been carried out as specifically requested.
In circumstances where specific instructions are given, these instructions may result in an execution that is less satisfactory than what may have been achieved in the absence of the instruction.
Where you provide specific instructions covering only part of an order, OCBC Bank will not consider itself released from its best execution obligations for the parts of the order which are not covered by the instructions. In this case, OCBC Bank will comply with our BE policy in respect of that part of the trade not covered by the instructions.
Where specific instructions given by you cannot be followed, OCBC Bank will inform you of the reasons before executing your order(s).
Order handling
We have further procedures in place to ensure we execute and allocate your orders promptly and fairly, taking into account the need to manage any potential conflicts of interest that may exist between you, ourselves and our other clients.
We will execute your order in line with other comparable client orders sequentially and promptly, unless (i) the characteristics of your order or prevailing market conditions make this impracticable; or (ii) your interests require otherwise.
Where you do not provide specific instructions, we will execute and allocate the order as soon as reasonably practicable.
When executing your order, we may decide to aggregate the order with a transaction for our own account or that of another client. Such aggregation will be taken, for example, to provide a better price to you or to reduce transaction costs by allowing us to execute in a larger size. We will only aggregate your order if it is unlikely that the aggregation will work overall to your disadvantage. Where we are unable to fill an aggregated order in full, we will allocate the executed notional on a fair and equitable basis.
We will endeavour to communicate the order execution and allocation status of the order to you as soon as reasonably practicable.
Matters outside of the Bank's control
In some cases, whether as a result of system failures, disrupted markets or otherwise, it may be necessary to execute client orders in a different manner as documented for the financial instrument in question. In such circumstances, the transacting unit will still seek to achieve the best possible result available in the prevailing circumstances.

Branch Analytics
Our branch and technology team have been hard at work to enhance your experience when you visit our branches. One way in which we are doing so is through Branch Analytics, technology that provides data-driven insights to help us improve your banking experience.
Such insights tell us about the performance of events, products, promotions and ad campaigns in branches equipped with this technology. From these insights, we are better able to curate and improve your experience through promotions and advertisements.
Because we know that you care about how your information is collected, used and disclosed, we put a lot of thought into how we can protect your privacy. We assure you that Branch Analytics will only provide aggregated and anonymised data. This means that the data will be presented by category and will not contain any specific information about individual visitors. The data derived cannot be linked to any one visitor; rather, it will only show a total, average and percentage score about the performance of a branch, product, promotion, event and ad campaign. We will know, for example, the average time a visitor stays in a branch. However, we will not be able to map this to any personal data that the Bank has about the visitor, such as his/her name or identification number.
What data is Branch Analytics collecting?
Branch Analytics seeks to understand branch visitation patterns and the demographics of our visitors. This data is reported in an aggregated and anonymised manner – no information is mapped to any individual visitor. We do not share or disclose anything that can be linked to a visitor. The data will only show a total, average and percentage score about age groups, gender and visitation patterns – for example, the most common age group to visit a branch or the average time a visitor stays in a branch.
How does Branch Analytics benefit branch visitors?
This technology allows us to continuously improve the experience for branch visitors. With data on branch visitation patterns, we can improve and tweak our branch offerings, such as enhancing branch layouts, changing the placements of our products and services, improving the selection and availability of products, and bringing better value through promotions and advertisements.
Will my personal data be shared?
No. Your personal data will never be shared with any third party as part of the service.
How is OCBC storing and protecting my personal data?
The personal data collected by Branch Analytics will be stored and protected in accordance with OCBC’s Data Protection Policies. These are available at
www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/policies
.
How will Branch Analytics protect my privacy?
We are committed to protecting your privacy and strive to put in place robust security measures to protect your personal data. We have in place a comprehensive data protection management programme to ensure that we have satisfied our legal obligations to protect your personal data. For more information, please refer to OCBC’s Data Protection Policies at
www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/policies
.
Where have you rolled out Branch Analytics?
Branch Analytics has been rolled out at Wisma Atria Branch.
Are you able to map these analytics to video recordings or images of visitors, or to specific individuals?
No. We will only have access to aggregated and anonymised insights into the performance of our products, promotions and ad campaigns. Video recordings captured under Branch Analytics will be retained for security and analytics purposes.
Will I receive targeted ads based on Branch Analytics data?
As we are unable to identify any individual visitors, we will not be able to send targeted ads.
Am I able to opt out of this?
As we are unable to identify any individual visitors, we will not be able to provide an opt-out service for Branch Analytics. Please be aware that video recordings captured under Branch Analytics will be retained for security and analytics purposes.

Before entering your User ID and PIN, you should always ensure that the website you are visiting belongs to OCBC Bank.

This precaution will ensure that you are not revealing your OCBC Bank Internet Banking Access Code and PIN to a website other than OCBC Bank.
To ensure that you enjoy the highest level of security possible, all browsers and application software should be upgraded to support SSL 256-bit encryption or a higher encryption standard with the most updated security features available.
It is important to protect yourself against any forms of online theft of your Access Code/User ID/Username and PIN/Password. Each valid Access Code/User ID/Username and PIN/Password identifies you uniquely as one of our valued customers.

Malware Notification
Learn more about Phishing, Malware and other Online Card Transaction Security Risks
Due to the open nature of the Internet, the use of your OCBC credit or debit cards ("OCBC cards") over the Internet are inherently subjected to risks such as online theft of your OCBC card numbers, login credentials and PIN/passwords, virus attacks, phishing, malware, hacking, unauthorised access and fraudulent transactions.
This includes using your OCBC cards to make payments for products, services or subscriptions online via third party websites or apps, any digital payment system (e.g. Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay etc), or whenever you save or use your OCBC cards as cards on file on any third party payment services (e.g. PayPal).
While OCBC Bank has put in place security practices and measures to safeguard against these risks, the Bank is still unable to guarantee the complete security of your transactions against any attacks from malicious programmes.
As an OCBC Bank customer, you play an important role in safeguarding your use of OCBC cards online.
What is a phishing scam? How does it affect my use of my OCBC cards online?
Phishing is a form of social engineering that may lead to identity theft. Phishing attacks typically use emails or malicious websites to solicit personal information by posing as legitimate companies or trustworthy organisations.
Phony websites, suspicious emails, or mobile messages (e.g. from SMS, WhatsApp), purporting to be from OCBC Bank, may contain malware, URLs, shortened URLs, or fraudulent requests for sensitive information or action to enter OTP into websites that look legitimate.
Phishing emails may contain malicious attachments that have malware embedded. The attachments may purport to be invoices, business accounting documents, user account information or other seemingly work-related attachments. When the attachments are opened, the malware infects your computers or devices to steal personal information, as well as login credentials.
What is a malware? How does it affect my use of my OCBC cards online?
Malware targets customers' computers/mobile devices to steal their login credentials and other important information. For example: your user IDs, passwords or PINs, and One-Time Passwords (OTP), biometric or other authentication credentials for logging into third party payment systems or digital payment systems, OCBC card details or other personal information.
Typically, these malware are embedded as attachments or hyperlinks in emails or mobile messages (e.g. from SMS, WhatsApp) received by customers. Once the customer clicks on the attachment/hyperlink or download/update the mobile apps or software, the malware installs itself onto the computer/mobile device.
This may enable the malware to steal the customer's login credentials, OCBC card details or other personal information.
SMS OTP and biometric or other authentication credentials (eg. fingerprint or other biometric verification) may be intercepted through compromised or infected mobile devices and used for fraudulent banking transactions.
The malware also works by redirecting customers to a fake webpage, pop up window or overlay that looks similar to the website you are trying to visit. It may request for your login credentials, including your user IDs, passwords or PINs, One-Time Passwords (OTP), biometric or other authentication details, which may or may not be masked. It then tries to access your account to create fraudulent transactions.
How do I know if my computer/mobile device is compromised by malware?
Watch out for these warning signs, for example:
If your mobile phone remains locked with screen showing "System update in progress. Please wait." This screen keeps appearing within seconds after your mobile phone is switched on or even after doing a force restart of your phone.
If you are prompted to install mobile apps from untrusted sources or to grant special permission to specific mobile apps.
The URL showing on the login page of any website you are accessing is different from the website you are trying to access.
Repeated prompts for password, PIN, OTP or other authentication even though you have entered the login credentials correctly.
A delayed pop-up screen that says the system is not available and repeatedly asks you to enter OTP or use your hardware token to generate an OTP.
Prompts to authorise transactions which you have not initiated, using OTPs generated through your hardware token. For example: While trying to login, you are prompted to enter a 6-digit number shown on your computer screen into your hardware token. Then you are asked to press the "Sign" button on the token and key in the OTP generated from the hardware token into the computer screen.
Your password or PIN is visible when you type them into the password or PIN field it should be masked.
You receive SMS messages on OTP or transactions which you did not initiate
A redirection to a third-party website, which may feature a hotline number or an unsolicited request.
You receive a call purportedly from a staff in OCBC asking you to verbally reveal your OCBC card numbers, user ID, password or PIN, OTP or hardware token details (Note: OCBC Bank will never ask a customer to reveal such details).
