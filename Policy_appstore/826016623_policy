California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information.

Additionally, you have the right to ask these businesses to delete Personal Information collected from you (certain exceptions apply). If the business sells Personal Information, you have a right to opt-out of that sale. Finally, a business cannot discriminate against you for exercising a right under CCPA.
‍
When offering services to its Clients, PushPress acts as a “service provider” under the CCPA.

Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy describes the different types of cookies that are used on the websites of PushPress, Inc. (“PushPress”). Please also consult our Privacy Policy to understand how we handle personal and other information in general.
1. What are Cookies?
Cookies are a standard feature of websites that allow us to store small amounts of data on your computer or other device about your visit to our websites. Cookies help us learn which areas of our websites are useful and which areas need improvement.
Some cookies may facilitate additional website features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analyzing usage for website optimization, providing custom or localized content and pricing, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to Personal or Other Information you submit while on our websites.
2. What Cookies and Similar Technologies Do We Use?
Cookies
We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience on our websites. We use various types of cookies:
Essential cookies, persistent and session type, store information to enable core website functionality, such as Live Chat and Client ID remembrance.
Functional cookies are cookies that are used to track your preferences, such as your preferred language or display settings, and customize the website to you. Some of these cookies may be essential cookies.
Analytics cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites and our marketing campaigns.
Advertising cookies may be set through our website by our advertising partners. Data may be collected by these companies that enable them to serve up advertisements on other websites that are relevant to your interests.
Web Beacons
Web beacons, also known as pixel tags, are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. We (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our services, or other information we or they have collected. Web beacons may be used within our services to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by web beacons to our subscribers’ and end users’ personal information. For example, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Web Beacons are also deployed by third parties, in connection with cookies, to serve interest-based (and other) advertising, as described in the below section titled “Advertising Networks”.
LSOs
We use Local Shared Objects (“LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our websites. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use LSOs to collect and store information.
Analytics Software
We and our third party tracking-utility partners use log files on our services to gather certain information automatically and store it for analytical purposes. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use third party partners such as Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
We also use this information to track and aggregate other information to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users’ movements around our services and to gather demographic information about our user base in the aggregate.
Similarly, we or a third party data partner may associate cookies with hashed (non-human readable) versions of your registration data (e.g., your email address), along with other interest-based or demographic data. You can learn more about or opt out of this type of advertising through the links in the following paragraph. Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change.
