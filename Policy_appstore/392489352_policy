nonsense
The app just marks its sign in random places paying no attention to where the user is playing. Therefore the app can never win a round. Rubbish
Terrible
This app by far is the worst app EVER in my opinion it is a piece of 💩🚽 I felt like 🔫 myself while playing. From me it's a defo 👎👿
Crap
This app is useless it lets u win every time its to easy and a waste of time.don't download
