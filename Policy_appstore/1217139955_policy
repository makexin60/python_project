Reading List does not actively collect any data about the books you add. It does, however, use some third-party services to report app crashes, and to track some usage analytics. It also uses a third-party service to provide a source of book metadata, and contains links to some third-party websites; when used, these services may additionally collect some data. This privacy policy provides information about how this data is used. If you have any questions, please email

Data Collected By Reading List
Crash Reports
In order to improve the stability of the app, a service is used to detect and report any crashes which may occur. This information is collected by a third party service Crashlytics, provided by Google; for full details you should consult the privacy policy of Google Firebase Crashlytics. Any reported crash will include some device information - such as the model, the app version, the iOS version and the amount of free RAM and storage space - as well as details of the code which was being executed at the point that the app crashed. On very rare occasions, error details may include more specific information, such as a piece of metadata from a book, if that information is related to the crash. This information is not used for any purposes other than diagnosing app bugs to enable them to be fixed and thus provide a more stable service. Additionally, this service reports the aggregate total number of users of the app, in order to calculate the percentage occurrence of each crash.
Analytics
In order to assess the comparative usage of different app features, a service is used to report some key app actions. This information is collected by third party services Google Firebase Analytics and TelemetryDeck; for full details you should consult the privacy policy of these services. This information is tracked for the purposes of determining which features are more frequently used, and so should be more actively developed, as well as providing information about sequences of events prior to a crash or error, to aid issue reproduction during development. This service reports some device information, including the device model, iOS version and approximate location (e.g. country). This service reports user navigation through different screens within the app, as well as some specific in-app events, including:
Performing an online search
Scanning a barcode
Adding a book manually
Updating book metadata manually
Changing the book sort order
Exporting data to CSV
Importing data from CSV
Enabling iCloud sync
Purchasing Reading List Pro
Please note that none of these events include any information about any of your books. For example, the
Online Search
event reports that a book was added via an online search, but not any details of that new book, nor the search terms used.
Purchases
Some functionality in Reading List is available only after purchase. To this end, Reading List collects purchase information using RevenueCat. This information is collected anonymously and is not linked to user identities.
Data Collected By Other Services
Book Search Data
When adding books via a method which looks up book metadata online, that data is obtained from Google Books or from Apple Books. If you scan a barcode, the ISBN from the barcode is provided to Google Books in order to obtain book metadata. If you search online, your search terms are provided to Google Books or Apple Books in order to obtain book metadata. These services may also collect some other information from your device, such as the IP address and model number. For details, consult the privacy policy of these third party services.
Links to Other Sites
This app contains some links to third-party websites. If you click on a link to a third-party website, you will be directed to that site. These external sites are not operated by me, and thus you should review the Privacy Policy of these websites. The sites linked to by this app include: links to the license agreements of third-party code libraries, links to books on Google Books, links to books on Amazon, and links to books on Bookshop.org.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You should review policy for any changes; I will notify you of any changes by updating the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately.
