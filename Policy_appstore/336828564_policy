Device and activity data may be automatically collected via our Sites, as described below.
Device Information.
Depending on the permissions you’ve granted and other factors, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device when you download or use apps created by our Sites, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, certain player search results, and other personalized content. Examples of the device information we may collect include:
Attributes such as the operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.
Device locations, including non-specific geolocation data.
Connection and device information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number and IP address.
Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services, and we encourage you to contact your device manufacturer for detailed instructions on how to do that.
Activity and Cookie Data
. Your Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which store small amounts of data on your computer or device about your visit to our Sites. We and our service providers use browser and flash cookies and other common online tracking technologies, including electronic images known as “web bugs” (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons”). We generally refer to such other tracking technologies (including pixels and tags) and cookies as “cookies.”
Cookies allow us and our service providers to automatically collect information regarding general user-traffic patterns, and your interactions with our Sites, including managed social media presences, and other unaffiliated sites and mobile applications. In using such technology, we thus collect such automatically transmitted data as the page served, time, source of the request, type of browser making the request, preceding page view, dynamic IP addresses and other such information to understand how our advertising campaigns are performing or how to improve and tailor advertising and the Sites experience for you. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you. Please see below for a description of how our Sites may be impacted by cookie settings on your devices.
Payment Information.
If you purchase any products on our Sites, we will collect payment card information from you, including your name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address. This information will be transmitted to appropriate third party payment service providers. We may offer you the option to save certain payment card information on our Sites. If you elect to save such information on our Sites, you will be able to add, delete, or modify that information at any time using your account settings. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial, transactional or other information from such third party payment service providers for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Sites, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, protecting against or identifying possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.
Social Media Platforms and Networks.
If you interact with us on social media or use features, such as plugins, widgets, social media sign-in or other tools made available by social media platforms or networks (such as, but not limited to, Facebook Connect) in connection with our Sites and Other Channels, we may collect information that you share with us on social media or that such platforms share with us. Please review the privacy policies and settings of the social media platforms and networks that you use for more information about their privacy practices.
What are our policies to manage cookies, “Do Not Track” signals and interest-based advertising?
Cookie Policy; Controlling Our Tracking Tools.
You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our Sites, although active participation in certain areas of our Sites may require cookies. You can set your browser to refuse or delete cookies. Please consult the corresponding instructions of the manufacturer for more detailed information on the actual procedure. If you configure your computer or device to block all cookies, you may disrupt certain features of our sites and limit the functionality we can provide when you visit or use our Sites. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this Privacy Policy will stop.
Responding to “Do Not Track.”
Some browsers have a “
Do Not Track
” (DNT) feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals. However, if you are a resident of a Covered State (defined below) that requires honoring certain opt-out preference signals, we will treat such opt-out preference signals as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal information, or of opting out of the processing of personal information for targeted advertising, as applicable.
Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads.
We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads, including ads served on or through our Sites or on other companies’ websites. These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties on our Sites and through third party websites. For example, your postal code may be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our Sites or on third party websites.
You may prevent Google’s collection of data generated by your use of the Sites (including your IP address) by downloading and installing a Browser Plugin available at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
To exercise certain opt-out choices you may have regarding Cookies from certain providers, please visit the consumer opt-out pages at the
Digital Advertising Alliance
and
Network Advertising Initiative
.
Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on some mobile devices. Users may opt out of certain ads on mobile applications or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings.

When accessing a secure site, the first characters of the site address change from “http” to “https.” If your browser or firewall does not allow use of secure sites, you will not be able to make purchases on our Sites.

As a consumer from a Covered State, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale/sharing of your Personal Information.

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception (under the State Privacy Laws) applies. However, we may retain Personal Information that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to perform certain actions set forth under the State Privacy Laws, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.
Right to Data Portability
As a consumer from a Covered State, you have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information we have collected and maintained about you. Note that if you are a California Consumer, the CCPA allows you to request your information from us up to twice during a 12-month period. To the extent feasible, we will provide our response in a readily usable (and usually electronic) format.
Right to Correct
As a consumer from a Covered State, you have the right to request the correction of any Personal Information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes for which we process it.
Right to Opt Out
You have the right to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for the purposes of: (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of Personal Information; and/or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.
As of the latest date of the Privacy Policy:
We do process Personal Information (and share it with third parties) for the purposes of targeted advertising, which may include cross-context behavioral advertising;
We do sell Personal Information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration; and
We do not engage in profiling decisions based on your Personal Information that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.
We do not sell or share the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is less than 16 (but greater than 13) years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. To our knowledge, we do not sell or share the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age.
If you wish to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for any of the above purposes, or to opt back in, please visit the
Your Privacy Choices

Where required by State Privacy Laws, we will also treat opt-out preference signals (including global privacy control (“GCP”) signals) as valid opt-out requests.
Right to Limit the Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information
Although you have the right to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive Personal Information (“SPI”) if we are using your SPI, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, we do not collect SPI from you and have not done so within the past 12 months.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights, including but not limited to, by:
Denying you goods or services.

Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.

Calling 1-800-484-6267
By visiting Your Privacy Choices Webpage
Process for Verifying a Consumer’s Request
We will verify any consumer’s request to exercise the Right to Know or the Right to Request Deletion using the following process:
Whenever feasible, we will match, or will engage a third-party identification verification service to match, the identifying information provided by you to the Personal Information that we maintain already on our systems. We will generally avoid requesting additional information for the purposes of verification. Only if we are unable to verify your identity or residency from the information already maintained by us will we request additional information from you. The additional Personal Information collected will only be used for the purposes of accurately verifying your identity in order to effectively allow you to exercise your rights under the Covered State Privacy Laws and for the purposes of fraud prevention. Once we have satisfied these purposes, we will delete the additional Personal Information collected from you as soon as practically possible, except as required for compliance with our record-keeping requirements and applicable law.
At a minimum, we will ask you for your name and email address. However, we may require you to provide us with data points that ensure that we can verify your consumer request to a reasonable degree of certainty.
Inability to Verify a Request
If we are unable to verify your identity to a degree of certainty as required by the applicable law through any reasonable method, we will state in a written response to you that we are unable to verify it.
Authorized Agents
You may designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf to make a request under the Covered State Privacy Laws by using the same channels for exercising your rights described above, such as requesting disclosure of any Personal Information sold or collected by Hugo Boss USA; or requesting deletion or correction of such Personal Information. If your authorized agent does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to submit verified requests for disclosure, deletion, or correction, we reserve the right to deny such a request that we have received and will explain to your authorized agent why we have denied such request. If you should use an authorized agent to exercise your various rights under the Covered State Privacy Laws, we may also require that you (i) provide your authorized agent with written permission to exercise your various rights and (ii) verify your own identity with us through the processes laid out in the sections above and (iii) confirm with us directly that you have provided your authorized agent with permission to submit the request.
Responding to Your Request
We will make every effort to respond to your request within 45 days from when you contacted us. If you have a complex request, State Privacy Laws, allow us up to 90 days to respond. We will still contact you within 45 days from when you contacted us to let you know we need more time to respond. We reserve the right, as permitted, to charge you a reasonable fee to cover administrative costs if your requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.
California “Shine the Light”
In addition to the above rights, under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light”), California residents may have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (a) a list of the categories of personal information, as defined under Shine the Light, such as name, email address, and mailing address, and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties.

Your Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored

Forter
”) are committed to protecting your privacy. Forter provides fraud and abuse detection and trust products and services designed to help e-commerce merchants detect and prevent fraud and abuse on their websites, mobile applications and other digital assets, as further described below.
This Privacy Policy describes what Personal Data (defined below) we collect from End Users when visiting Merchant Sites using the Forter Services (each, as defined below), how we use your Personal Data, who we share it with, certain rights you may have with respect to your Personal Data, and how to contact us about our privacy practices.
For purposes of applicable EU data protection laws, Forter Ltd and each of its affiliates may each be a data controller of your Personal Data. For purposes of the CCPA, Forter and its affiliates may each act as a service provider (as defined in the CCPA) with respect to your Personal Data. Additional details about each of these entities can be found at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not describe our collection and use of personal data when visitors access our website,
www.forter.com
. For information about how we collect and use personal data collected through our website, please visit our
Website Privacy Policy
.
Overview
This section provides an overview of Forter and the Forter Services and a summary of the information provided below in the full version of this Privacy Policy. The full version of this Privacy Policy contains more detailed information regarding our privacy practices.
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at privacy@forter.com.
Who we are and what we do
Forter is a global company that provides fraud and abuse detection and trust-based products and services (the “
Forter Services
”) designed to help e-commerce merchants (our “
Merchants
”) detect and prevent fraud and abuse on their websites, mobile applications and other digital assets (the “
Merchant Sites
”), using our proprietary machine learning technology. In order to provide the Forter Services to our Merchants, we need to collect and process certain information about individuals who visit and interact with their Merchant Sites as end users (“
End Users
”), which information may include data that identifies or can be used to identify End Users, including name, address, telephone number and email address, and transaction, behavioral, device and connection data, as well as other information about End Users that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data (such data, “
Personal Data
”). Our proprietary machine learning technology uses this information to detect and prevent fraud and abuse on the Merchant Sites in real time. You can learn more about our products
here
.
How the Forter Services work
Our Merchants provide us with data and information about End Users and their interactions on their Merchant Sites through our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We also collect behavioral, device and connection data directly from End Users through standard tracking technologies (our JavaScript and mobile SDK), which are embedded on the Merchant Sites (collectively, “
End User Data
”). End User Data may include Personal Data. We do not collect any “special categories” of personal data about End Users (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, or information about your health or genetic or biometric data).
Once we have collected relevant End User Data, we process this data through our machine learning platform to return a recommendation to our Merchants as to whether to approve or decline a transaction or other event (e.g., an account signup or login event or abuse of a Merchant’s policies), or make a recommendation (e.g., for additional verification), on a particular Merchant Site. In addition to these decisions, we provide our Merchants with aggregated reporting and insights into transactions and other relevant events on their Merchant Sites.
Our recommendations, reporting and insights are used by our Merchants to assist them in detecting and preventing fraud and abuse on their Merchant Sites. It is ultimately up to our Merchants to decide what action to take or not to take using the information and insights we provide.
We also use End User Data (including Personal Data) across our network of Merchants to improve our modeling and algorithms and to provide more accurate recommendations for all of our Merchants. While we use End User Data for such purposes, we never share End User Data between our Merchants.
Overview of our privacy practices
We collect End User Personal Data when you interact with the Merchant Sites, through our APIs and standard tracking technologies, as further described below.
We rely on our and our Merchants’ legitimate interests in detecting and preventing fraud and abuse as the legal basis for our processing of End User Personal Data, as further described below.
We do not rent or sell your Personal Data, and we do not share your Personal Data with third parties, other than with select trusted third party service providers, to provide the Forter Services, to comply with applicable law or the request of a governmental entity, in connection with certain corporate transactions, and in connection with litigation and compliance monitoring, as further described below.
We employ industry best practices and regularly commission third party audits and certifications to ensure the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data and to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access and improper use.
Full Services Privacy Policy
Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes what Personal Data Forter collects in connection with the Forter Services from End Users, how we use your Personal Data, who we share it with, how we safeguard your Personal Data, certain rights you may have with respect to your Personal Data, and how to contact us about our privacy practices.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
What type of information we collect from End Users
We collect your Personal Data when you interact with the Merchant Sites through our APIs and standard tracking technologies, as further described below. We also collect certain information from third party sources, as further described below.
1. Information provided by our Merchants
Our Merchants provide us with data and information about End Users and their interactions on their Merchant Sites through our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) (described below). Our Merchants ultimately decide what Personal Data to send to us for use in connection with the Forter Services. Our legal and product teams work closely with our Merchants to assess the scope of Personal Data that will be shared with us through our APIs, and ultimately only send such Personal Data that is necessary for us to provide the Forter Services used by a particular Merchant.
While the exact nature and scope of Personal Data sent to us by our Merchants through our APIs will vary depending on the particular Forter Services provided, Personal Data sent by our Merchants via our APIs typically includes the following:
Contact information:
this includes information such as your name, phone number, email and mailing address.
Transaction data:
this includes information about a transaction you have completed on a Merchant Site, including your name, email address, billing and shipping mailing addresses, items purchased, price paid, order status and chargeback information. We also receive basic information about your payment and billing method, but do not collect or keep your complete credit card details.
Account information:
this includes information about your account and preferences on a Merchant Site.
Browser, device and connection data:
this includes information about the personal computer or mobile device you use to access the Merchant Sites. Such information may include technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information such as the browser used to access the Merchant Site, the device model and operating system, unique device identifiers, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you accessed the Merchant Site.
2. Information we automatically collect when you visit a Merchant Site
We use standard tracking technologies (described below) to automatically collect certain behavioral, device and connection data while you are interacting with a Merchant Site.
Our Merchants ultimately decide what pages on their Merchant Sites to embed our tracking technologies. Our legal and product teams work closely with our Merchants to assess the scope of Personal Data that will be automatically collected by us through our tracking technologies, and our tracking technologies are ultimately only placed on the Merchant Sites where such placement is necessary for us to provide the Forter Services.
While the exact nature and scope of Personal Data that is automatically collected by us through our tracking technologies will vary depending on the particular Forter Services provided, Personal Data collected through our tracking technologies typically includes the following:
Browser, device and connection data:
this includes information about the personal computer or mobile device you use to access the Merchant Sites. Such information may include technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information such as the browser used to access the Merchant Site, the device model and operating system, unique device identifiers, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you accessed the Merchant Site.
Behavioral data:
this includes information regarding your activity on a Merchant Site, such as the time and frequency of access, the referrer page domain, pages viewed.
We may use the following standard tracking technologies on our Merchant Sites. Which of the below technologies a Merchant ultimately integrates with depends on the nature of the Forter Services provided.
JavaScript:
a JavaScript code is a tiny snippet of code inserted into the content of a Merchant Site. This allows Forter to collect the information described above.
Mobile SDKs:
mobile SDKs (or ‘software development kits’) are blocks of code embedded into the mobile version of a Merchant Site. This allows Forter to collect the information described above.
Information collected from third party sources
In some cases, we may combine or enhance the information we collect about you (via our APIs and tracking technologies) with information we receive from third parties. For example, we may receive information from third parties regarding the type of phone associated with your phone number (e.g., mobile or landline), geographic coordinates of your billing and shipping address, and complementary details about your phone number and address.
How we use your information and legal bases for processing
We only use End User Personal Data (i) to provide the Forter Services to our Merchants and (ii) to improve the Forter Services to provide more accurate recommendations for our Merchants. We may also use End User Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations. We never share End User Data between our Merchants.
We rely on the following legal bases to process End User Personal Data: (i) our legitimate interest in providing the Forter Services and improving the detection and prevention of fraud and abuse on the Merchant Sites; and (ii) our and our Merchants’ legitimate interest in detecting and preventing fraud and abuse on the Merchant Sites and ensuring a secure customer journey on the Merchant Sites for our Merchants and End Users.
We may also process End User Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
Automated decision-making
The proprietary machine learning technology that powers the Forter Services relies on the automated processing of End User Personal Data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to detect and prevent fraudulent and abusive behavior on the Merchant Sites. This means that our recommendations to our Merchants as to whether to approve or decline a transaction or other event on a Merchant Site as part of the Forter Services is typically made without human review or intervention. All automated decision-making by Forter is done in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
Who we share your information with
We do not rent or sell your Personal Data, or share your Personal Data with third parties, except as described below. All third party service providers we use are evaluated by both our legal and security teams prior to engagement, to ensure such providers implement and maintain appropriate measures to protect your Personal Data.
We may share your Personal Data with the following third parties:
Forter Affiliates:
we may share your Personal Data between and among Forter Ltd and its affiliates. Those affiliates are listed under “
How to Contact Us
” at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Trusted third party service providers:
we may share your Personal Data with trusted third-party service providers that we have engaged to assist us in performing the Forter Services (e.g. data hosting providers), as necessary for such third parties to provide services to us. Prior to sharing your Personal Data with our third-party service providers, we ensure that such third parties commit to protecting the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data.
Data enrichment providers:
we may share End User Personal Data with trusted third parties (e.g., location data or identity verification providers) for data enrichment purposes. Enriching End User Personal Data allows us to make more informed recommendations about your activity on the Merchant Sites. When we share your Personal Data with our data enrichment providers, we require that such data is only used for the purpose of providing a service to us and not for any other purpose. We also ensure that such third parties commit to protecting the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data.
We may also disclose your Personal Data to third parties if we believe disclosure of such data is necessary to: (i) comply with applicable law or a request from a court, regulator, or other governmental entity; (ii) enforce our contractual rights and our policies, including in connection with investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (iv) enforce our intellectual property or other legal rights.
Additionally, we may share your Personal Data with third parties in connection with an actual or contemplated corporate transaction involving Forter, such as a merger, acquisition, divestiture, reorganization, financing or sale of our assets, as well as in connection with an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving us. Any entity that acquires us (in whole or in part) shall be permitted to continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy and shall assume our rights and obligations with respect to your Personal Data, as described herein.

Correct any Personal Data we hold about you that may be inaccurate;
Request that we delete your Personal Data (subject to certain limitations);
In certain circumstances, restrict or object to us processing your Personal Data;

For purposes of the California Consumer Protection Act 2018 (California Civil Code §§ 1798.100 to 1798.199) including as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “
CCPA
”), Forter acts as a ‘Service Provider’ (as defined in the CCPA) in providing the Forter Services to our Merchants, who act as ‘Businesses’ (as defined in the CCPA) with respect to your Personal Data. Accordingly, we do not retain, use, or disclose End User Personal Data of California residents for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Forter Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA and applicable regulations, including to detect data security incidents or protect against fraudulent or illegal activity.
Individuals who are California residents have certain rights under the CCPA with respect to their Personal Data, including the right to:
Request certain information about your Personal Data, including the categories of Personal Data we hold, the categories of sources of Personal Data we collected about you, the business or commercial purpose for which it was collected,  the categories of third parties with whom your Personal Data has been shared, and the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;

. We will respond within the timeframes required under applicable law. When handling your request, we may need to request additional information from you (which may include Personal Data) to help us confirm your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. Please note that if you do not provide us with this additional information, we may be unable to process your request.

Your Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Data
You have the right to opt-out of having your personal information sold. Under certain state laws, this is defined as us receiving some form of payment or other value in exchange for providing your personal information to a non-affiliated third party. You also have the right to opt-out of having your personal information shared for targeted, or cross-contextual, marketing purposes. To effectuate either or both of these rights, please review the steps below. 

We only sell personal information, as defined under certain state laws, to network advertisers who use cookies to collect your personal information to then perform targeted marketing on other sites or platforms. You may opt-out of the sale of your personal information by turning off these marketing cookies. To do so, go to the “Marketing Cookies” tab. By default, the cookies are “on” which is noted by the blue dot in the upper right-hand corner of that tab. To turn off these Marketing Cookies, click the blue dot which will slide the dot to the left and turn it Gray. Then click “Confirm My Choices” in the pop-up box. Please note that if you clear your cookies or use another browser, as described further in our Privacy Policy (see the link below), you will need to return and turn off Marketing Cookies again. Currently we do not share or sell information through additional marketing processes offline.
