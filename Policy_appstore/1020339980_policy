For California Users.
As related to California AB 1584 (Buchanan) Privacy of Student Records: 3rd-Party Digital Storage & Education Software (Education Code section 49073.1), we agree to the following:
1.
Student records obtained by Promethean from a Local Educational Agency (an “LEA”) continue to be the property of and under the control of the LEA.  The LEA retains full ownership rights to the information in the Personal Information and education records it provides to a Product or Online Service.
2.     Promethean Product or Online Services users may retain possession and control of their own generated content by signing into and accessing their Product or Online Service account and downloading (or updating) their information within the Product or Online Service.  Students have access to and control of their own information and student-generated content subject to the limitations imposed by the student’s teacher.  For example, if a student completes an assessment using Promethean’s Product or Online Service and submits the assessment to the teacher within the Product or Online Service, the student may only retain possession and control of (or change answers to) the assessment if permitted by the teacher.
3.     Parents, legal guardians, or eligible students may review Personally Identifiable information in the student’s records and correct erroneous information by contacting their educational institution.  Additionally, Product and Online Services users may access, correct, update, or delete personal information in their profile by signing into the Product or Online Service, accessing their account, and making the appropriate changes, or by contacting us directly from within the Product and Online Service, or submitting your request to us at privacy@prometheanworld.com.
4.     We are committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of student records.  Towards this end, we take the following actions: (i) we limit employee access to student data to only those employees with a need to such access to fulfill their job responsibilities; (ii) we conduct background checks on our employees and, specifically, upon all employees that may have access to student data; (iii) we require employees to sign confidentiality agreements prior to being granted access to any sensitive data; (iv) we conduct regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and (v) we protect personal information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect against unauthorized access, release or use.
5.     In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of a student’s records, we will (1) promptly notify the LEA unless specifically directed not to provide such notification by law enforcement officials; and (2) enact the response plan and procedures described in the Promethean Data Breach Incident Response Plan that is available to the LEA upon request.
6.     We will not use any information in a student record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
7.     We will not use any Personal Information within a student’s records in Products or Online Services to engage in targeted advertising.
8.     We will delete or de-identify student personal information when it is no longer needed, upon expiration or termination of our agreement with an LEA with any deletion or de-identification to be completed according to the terms of our agreement with the LEA, or at the direction or request of an LEA (school).
9.     We will work with the educational institution to ensure compliance with FERPA by providing parents, legal guardians and students with the ability to inspect and review their student records within the Product or Online Service and the means to correct any inaccuracies therein.
10.   We will not make material changes to our Privacy Policy, including adding material practices around material new or additional data collected, or material changes that lessen the previously described protections without prior notice to the LEA.
M.
Privacy Statement Changes and Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy For Products to reflect changes to our Personal Information practices at any time, so please review this Promethean Products Privacy Policy. If we update this Privacy Policy, changes will be reflected on this page and we will update the "Last Updated" date posted below, and in the event we make material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you. If you do not wish to accept the change(s) you may opt-out by deleting your account.

This Privacy Policy is limited to the Explain Everything Basics app.
Read the Privacy Policy of the platform
Last Updated: Nov 29, 2022
1. General information
Your privacy is extremely important to us.
Below is our Privacy Policy, which explains what personal information we collect and how we use that information.
Before we jump on to provide details, the main point is that Explain Everything Basics never sends any personal data or created content anywhere. All data stay on device and device only – that is, unless you decide to use some of the integrated external services and upload the content you create (YouTube, Dropbox, Google Drive etc.) – you may then refer to privacy policies of these external services.
This document covers the use and treatment of the Explain Everything Basics mobile app for iOS (“the App”) provided by Promethean Poland sp. z o. o. ( “Promethean”, “We”, “Our” or “Us“), including how Promethean treats information (including personal information) that we collect and receive.
The only information that is being shared with Promethean by the app is anonymized usage data, which mean “how and how often do you use certain functions of the app”. Promethean does not have access to any personally identifiable information and never sends it anywhere.
The term “Personal Information”, as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to any information that can be used to identify a specific person, or any anonymous information (e.g. IP address) that is linked to a specific person (including name, address, phone number or email address). Personal Information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person or directly identify you.
This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes. This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into Explain Everything’s Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”).
Promethean may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal information that does not enable Promethean to identify you.
The types of non-personal data Promethean may collect and use include:
(i) device properties, including, but not limited to IP address, Media Access Control (“MAC”) address and unique device identifier or other persistent or non-persistent device identifier (“Device ID”);
(ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; and (iv) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Promethean to improve the App. Application usage information may be tracked to determine which features are most popular, how they are being used, and how we can improve the application.
Promethean may use and disclose to Company partners and contractors the collected non-personal information for purposes of analyzing usage of the App, managing and providing the App and to further develop the App and other Promethean services and products.
You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Promethean may combine the anonymous information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
We use YouTube’s API services in connection with our App to provide certain features. As such, you acknowledge and agree that by using the YouTube integration with the App, you are also bound by
Google’s Privacy Policy
and
YouTube Terms of Service
. You may manage your YouTube API data by visiting Google’s security settings page at
https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
.
2. Children’s Personal Information
Explain Everything does not collect any Personal Information from students (“Children’s Personal Information”).
3. Information Collection and How it is Used
Explain Everything Basics does not collect any Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information.
The only information collected is anonymous data related to use of certain functions of the app, used for enhancing the app.
4. Privacy Policy Changes
Promethean may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.
We may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to this Privacy Policy, but you should periodically review the most up-to-date version. Your continued use of the App following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.

Please also note that Promethean also collects data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual user.  For example, we may collect information about your computer, including, where available, your device type, operating system, and browser type as well as information regarding your activities on one of our websites or applications such as your browsing actions and patterns.  This information allows us to better understand customer behavior, improve our Products, and improve the user experience with our Products. This information is aggregated and used to help us understand which parts of the Product are of the most interest and to improve users’ experiences on or with our Products.
For many of the same reasons as outlined above, we may use a cookie file, which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. These files help us to improve our websites and deliver better and more personalised Products. Cookies enable us to:
ensure that content from our websites is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
speed up your use of the website;
store information about your preferences;
customise the website according to your individual interests;
estimate our customer base and usage patterns; and
recognise you when you return to the website.
You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites or Products. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our Product. To understand the cookies we use, please review the Cookies Policy applicable to the Product that you are visiting.  A link to the applicable Cookie Policy is available on each of our Products.
Where We Store Your Personal Information
We maintain servers around the world and your Personal Information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. We always work to comply with laws applicable to your Personal Information and we will apply the protections described in this Privacy Policy to your Personal Information irrespective of where your Personal Information may be processed by Promethean.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the data that you transmit to any Promethean Product. Any transmission is, therefore, at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Disclosure of Your Information
Except as provided for herein, we will not sell or share Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes or advertisements unless you give us your consent to do so.
We may share your Personal Information with certain trusted third-party companies and individuals to perform tasks on our behalf, but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us, for example, to help us provide the website, to enhance the website, to increase the website’s functionality and user friendliness, to provide customer support, to improve your experience on the website, to respond to your inquiries or questions, or to provide you with information regarding our Products. Unless we tell you differently, these trusted third-party companies do not have any right to use your Personal Information beyond what is necessary to assist us with providing you the best possible service. To the extent we share Personal Information with any third party, we require them to comply with the requirements of a data processor under GDPR.
We may disclose your Personal Information if Promethean or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personal Information held by Promethean will be included among the transferred assets.
We may disclose your Personal Information if Promethean is required by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that, for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate; and
We may disclose your Personal Information if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users.
Children
We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children. In addition, in the countries that we offer services where we collect the personal information of children we comply with the applicable laws regarding the collection of the personal information of children. Specifically, we do not knowingly collect, use, or process Personal Information from children under the age applicable to their country of residence without verifiable parental consent or, alternatively, a teacher, school or school district has consented to or authorized the processing of the student Personal Information for an educational purpose.
If we ever learn that we have collected the Personal Information of a child without parental consent when parental consent is required or without other lawful authorization, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.  If you know that we have inadvertently collected any Personal Information about a child without the required parental consent or authorization, please contact us at
privacy@prometheanworld.com
.
Do Not Track (DNT)
Promethean does not track its users over time or across third party websites to provide targeted advertising, and therefore, does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
Links to Other Sites
Our Products may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites and services of third parties to include but not be limited to our partner networks, advertisers, affiliates or other third parties. Please note that Promethean does not operate, manage or control the websites, services, or Personal Information processing of any such third parties and Promethean does not accept any responsibility for the processing of Personal Information by any such third party. Please carefully review the Privacy Notice, Terms of Use and Cookie Policy of each third party, as applicable, prior to clicking on any link to such third party’s website or service or allowing such third party to process your Personal Information.

As related to California AB 1584 (Buchanan) Privacy of Student Records: 3rd-Party Digital Storage & Education Software (Education Code section 49073.1), we agree to the following:
Student records obtained by Promethean from a Local Educational Agency (an “LEA”) continue to be the property of and under the control of the LEA.  The LEA retains full ownership rights to the information in the Personal Information and education records it provides to a Product or Online Service.
Promethean Product or Online Services users may retain possession and control of their own generated content by signing into and accessing their Product or Online Service account and downloading (or updating) their information within the Product or Online Service.  Students have access to and control of their own information and student-generated content subject to the limitations imposed by the student’s teacher.  For example, if a student completes an assessment using Promethean’s Product or Online Service and submits the assessment to the teacher within the Product or Online Service, the student may only retain possession and control of (or change answers to) the assessment if permitted by the teacher.
Parents, legal guardians, or eligible students may review Personally Identifiable information in the student’s records and correct erroneous information by contacting their educational institution.  Additionally, Product and Online Services users may access, correct, update, or delete personal information in their profile by signing into the Product or Online Service, accessing their account, and making the appropriate changes, or by contacting us directly from within the Product and Online Service, or submitting your request to us at privacy@prometheanworld.com.
We are committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of student records.  Towards this end, we take the following actions: (i) we limit employee access to student data to only those employees with a need to such access to fulfill their job responsibilities; (ii) we conduct background checks on our employees and, specifically, upon all employees that may have access to student data; (iii) we require employees to sign confidentiality agreements prior to being granted access to any sensitive data; (iv) we conduct regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and (v) we protect personal information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect against unauthorized access, release or use.
In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of a student’s records, we will (1) promptly notify the LEA unless specifically directed not to provide such notification by law enforcement officials; and (2) enact the response plan and procedures described in the Promethean Data Breach Incident Response Plan that is available to the LEA upon request.
We will not use any information in a student record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
We will not use any Personal Information within a student’s records in Products or Online Services to engage in targeted advertising.
We will delete or de-identify student personal information when it is no longer needed, upon expiration or termination of our agreement with an LEA with any deletion or de-identification to be completed according to the terms of our agreement with the LEA, or at the direction or request of an LEA (school).
We will work with the educational institution to ensure compliance with FERPA by providing parents, legal guardians and students with the ability to inspect and review their student records within the Product or Online Service and the means to correct any inaccuracies therein.
We will not make material changes to our Privacy Policy, including adding material practices around material new or additional data collected, or material changes that lessen the previously described protections without prior notice to the LEA.
Privacy Statement Changes and Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy For Products to reflect changes to our Personal Information practices at any time, so please review this Promethean Products Privacy Policy. If we update this Privacy Policy, changes will be reflected on this page and we will update the “Last Updated” date posted below, and in the event we make material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you. If you do not wish to accept the change(s) you may opt-out by deleting your account.
In the event of any conflict between the terms of this section 9 of the Privacy Policy and any other section of the Privacy Policy, then the terms of this section 9 of the Privacy Policy shall govern and control.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
