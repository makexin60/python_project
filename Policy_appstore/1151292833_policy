How Long We Keep Your Information

We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
We
will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service
s
or Apps
, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

our Service
s

ask us to delete your account.
Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.

Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.
Control over Your Information
We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.
Edit and export your data.
You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our
Service
s
or our A
pps.
Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.
Revoking permissions.
If you let us use your information, you can always change your mind and simply revoke your permission by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain
S
ervices
or Apps
may lose full functionality.
Deletion.

user
, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go
contact us
. You can also delete some information in
our Service
s
or Apps

Users in the European Union
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. You should also know that cream.software is the data controller of your personal information. Here is some additional information we would like to bring to your attention:
Bases for using your information
Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called "legal bases" and we typically rely on one of four:
Contract.
One reason we might use your information is because you've entered into an agreement with us.
Legitimate interest.
Another reason we might use your information is because we have - or a third party has - a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we need to use your information to provide and improve our
S
ervices
or Apps
, including protecting your account, providing customer support, and helping you find content we think you'll like. Because most of our
S
ervices
or Apps
are free, we also use some information about you to try and show you ads you'll find interesting. An important point to understand about legitimate interest is that our interests don't outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data doesn't significantly impact your privacy or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so.
Consent.
In some cases we'll ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes. If we do, we'll make sure you can revoke your consent in our
S
ervices
or Apps
or through your device permissions. Even if we're not relying on consent to use your information, we may ask you for
some
permission
s if needed
.
Legal obligation.
We may be required to use your personal information to comply with the law, like when we respond to valid legal process or need to take action to protect our users.
Your rights
We aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data. If you wish to be informed what Personal Data we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:
The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you.
Whenever made possible, you can access, update or request deletion of your Personal Data directly within your account settings section. If you are unable to perform these actions yourself, please contact us to assist you.
The right of rectification
. You have the right to have your information rectified if that information is inaccurate or incomplete.
The right to object.
You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data.
The right of restriction.
You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information.
The right to data portability.
You have the right to be provided with a copy of the information we have on you in a structured, machine-readable and commonly used format.
The right to withdraw consent.
You also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where Overpass Ltd relied on your consent to process your personal information.
Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.
Complaints?
If you're based in the EU, you can always file a complaint with the supervisory authority in your Member State. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the European Economic Area (EEA).
Transfer Of Data
Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to  -  and maintained on  -  computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
If you are located outside Poland and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to Poland and process it there.
Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
"
Do Not Track" Signals
We do not support Do Not Track ("DNT"). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable "Do Not Track" by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
Children
Our Services
or Apps
are not intended for - and we don't direct them to - anyone under 13. And that's why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. In addition, we may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of EU users between 13 and 16. In some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality to these users. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.
Security of your information
To help protect the privacy of data and personally identifiable information you transmit through use of this Site, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personal data to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or Services
or Apps
to you.
Revisions to the Privacy Policy
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we'll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we'll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that's available on our website or mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).
Disclaimer and limitation of liability
You use our Services or Apps at your own risk. They are provided "AS IS", without any warranties, and we do not warrant that our Services

In-app Purchases
Although the download of our Apps may be offered for free, some additional content can be purchased for real money inside Apps or Services. Such purchases do not always require the re-entry of credit card information because they may be made through an existing third-party account (such as a Microsoft, Google Play or iTunes account). If you do not want to use this feature, turn off in-app purchases in your device's settings. To learn how to disable in-app purchases, refer to the device manufacturer.
Some in-app purchases may be auto-renewable subscription based IAP which in simple terms means that:
Payment will be charged to your account (such as a Microsoft, Google Play or iTunes account) at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew (at the duration/price selected) unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hrs before the end of the current period.
Account (such as a Microsoft, Google Play or iTunes account) will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period
Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your account settings (such as a Microsoft, Google Play or iTunes account) after purchase.
Any unused portion of the free one month initial period will be forfeited when you purchases a subscription.
Additional content is offered "as is" and by making in-app purchases you, or anyone using your device and/or credentials, are responsible for any financial transactions and you agree that We will not be held responsible for any loss, material or otherwise. We reserve the right to deny refunding requests for in-app purchases in cases of negligence to the terms stated here in this agreement.
