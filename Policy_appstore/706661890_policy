Effective April 7, 2020. Updated October 30, 2024.
Edgeworks Entertainment and Alexander Winn (“we,” “our,” or “us”) operate the website

and a variety of mobile applications (the "Apps") on iOS and Android. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect personal information about our users on our website and in our apps.
1. Data Collection and Usage
Website User Information
We may collect limited user-submitted information, such as name and email address, for purposes including verifying users and providing account-related services. Additional optional information, like media interests or personal biographies, is collected only if provided by the user and is not required for membership.
In-App Data Collection
In our iOS and Android apps, we collect minimal data focused on improving the user experience and app performance. This includes anonymous, non-personal information related to in-app behavior, such as:
Usage statistics
Bug reports and crash data
We
do not
collect sensitive personal information such as phone numbers, addresses, or other personally identifying data. All data collected is intended solely for app optimization and service improvement.
2. Data Security
Website Data Security
EdgeworksEntertainment.com logs IP addresses of visitors for statistical purposes and to maintain the integrity of our services. IP addresses are not shared with third parties.
In-App Data Security
For both website and in-app data, we employ industry-standard security measures to protect against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security against external threats.
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

From time to time, we may provide aggregated demographic or statistical information to prospective partners for the purposes of securing advertising and promoting our services. This information is not personally identifiable and does not include individual user data.
4. Publicly Viewable Information on EdgeworksEntertainment.com
Any additional profile information that users submit beyond email addresses and passwords (e.g., media interests or biographies) may be visible to the public. Users are encouraged to exercise discretion when sharing any optional information, as EdgeworksEntertainment.com cannot control how third parties may use publicly available data.
