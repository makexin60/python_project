6. Communications with you
This section is to explain how we will ensure that you only receive communications that you wish to receive.
Marketing messages
We can only use your personal information to send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a “legitimate interest”. A “legitimate interest” is where we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. For example, contacting you with pre-departure information ahead of a journey you have booked with us. It must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you.
The personal data we have for you is made up of what you advise us and the data we collect about you when you use our products or services, or data provided to us from third parties we work with. We study this to form a view on what we think you may want or need or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products and services and offers which may be relevant for you.
We want to ensure that you are informed and aware of the best products, services, promotions and events that we can offer you. By consenting to receiving communications by postal mail, telephone, SMS, text-picture-video message, app push notification or email from us and any named third parties that feature at the point of obtaining consent in respect of such information, we will process your personal data in accordance with this privacy and cookie notice.
If you have provided your consent to receive marketing communications from us and you change your mind, you can change your preferences and unsubscribe at any time by unsubscribing from the relevant communication channel, changing your preferences in your web account, accessing
our Preference Centre
, or by contacting us at
dpo@c2crail.net
.
However, if you choose not to receive this information, we will be unable to keep you informed of new products, services and promotions that may interest you.
Whatever you choose, you will still receive booking confirmations and other information for example service updates.
Service messages
We may send you communications such as those which relate to any service updates e.g., service disruptions or cancellations or pre-travel information, and provide customer satisfaction surveys. We consider that we can lawfully send these communications to you as we have a legitimate interest to do so, namely, to effectively provide you with the best service we can to grow our business.

9. How do we protect your personal data?
This section explains how we keep your personal data safe and where it will be held.
We take your privacy seriously and are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal data you provide to us, and the choices you have regarding our collection and use of your personal data.
Once we have received your personal data, we follow strict security procedures as to how your personal data is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorised access.
Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not share this information with anyone. c2c or its employees will never ask you to provide your password over the phone or text – if you are requested to provide this, please contact us at
dpo@c2crail.net
.
The information that we collect from you may have been transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United Kingdom (UK). When we transfer and store your personal data outside of the UK, we will ensure that it is adequately protected by using appropriate safeguards as further detailed below.
Where your personal data is transferred from the UK to a recipient outside the UK in a country not recognised by the United Kingdom as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, such transfer shall be covered by a framework recognised by the relevant UK authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data including but not limited to: “Standard Contractual Clauses (the agreement in the form annexed to the European Commission’s decision of 5 February 2010 on Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries
which can be found here
.)”
Unfortunately, the transmission of your personal data via the internet is not completely secure and although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us over the internet and you acknowledge that any transmission is at your own risk.
10. How long do we keep your personal data?
This section explains the length of time that we will retain your personal data.
We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained. The criteria for determining the duration for which we will retain your personal data are as follows:
We will retain your personal data in a form that permits identification only for as long as:
We maintain an ongoing relationship with you; or
Your personal data is necessary in connection with the lawful purposes set out in this notice for which we have a valid legal basis
plus
The duration of:
any applicable limitation period under applicable law i.e., any period during which any person could bring a legal claim against us in connection with your personal data, or to which your personal data may be relevant); or
an additional reasonable period following the end of such applicable limitation period
and
In addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we may continue to process your personal data for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim.
During the periods in paragraphs 2.a and 2.b above, we will restrict our processing of your personal data to the storage of, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent that those data need to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim or obligation under applicable law.
After this period your personal data will be anonymised so that you are no longer identified or identifiable from such information, or securely deleted/destroyed.
Any third parties that we engage will keep your data stored on their systems for as long as is necessary to provide the relevant services to you or us. If we end our relationship with any third-party providers, we will make sure that they securely delete or return your personal data to us.
The retention periods for CCTV and BWV vary depending on the location and system in use. Such periods tend not to exceed 30 days and will always be reasonable or as long as is required by law. For further information on CCTV and retention periods please

for our contact details.
We may retain personal data about you for statistical purposes (for example, to help us better advertise our services). Where data is retained for statistical purposes, it will always be anonymised, meaning that you will not be identifiable from that data.
11. What are your rights?
This section explains that under data protection law, you have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your personal data. Further detailed information is available from the
Information Commissioner’s Office
which we have linked in the relevant section below:
Your right of access, to a copy of the personal data we hold about you

Your right to rectification, of inaccurate personal data we hold about you

Your right to data portability, transfer your personal data to you or a third party if technically feasible
This only applies to information you have given us. You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us from one organisation to another or give it to you.

For more details about your right to data portability, click here.
We respond to all requests within one calendar month. However, occasionally it may take us longer if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests or you have not supplied the information we need to respond to you. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances and we will explain to you the reasons for our refusal.

3. How do we use cookies?
We use cookies to provide the content, products and services you have asked for. Some of these cookies are necessary to help your devices download or stream information, so you can move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, content, products or services you have asked for cannot be provided.
Here are some examples of necessary cookies:
Position information on a smartphone screen, tablet or other screen so you can see the website and use its functionality
Keeping you logged in during your visit or enabling you to purchase products and services
When you add something to our online shopping basket, cookies make sure it’s still there when you get to the checkout page
We use cookies to improve your browsing experience. These cookies allow our application or website to remember choices you make, and they provide improved features. For example:
Remembering if you have filled in a survey, so you are not asked to again
Remembering if you have been to the application or website before
Restricting the number of times you are shown a particular advertisement (frequency capping)
Showing you information that’s relevant to content, products or services that you receive
We use cookies for Statistics. We keep track of, for example, what information and links are popular and which ones don’t get used as much. This helps us keep our information relevant and up to date. It’s also useful to be able to identify trends of how people find their way through our information as well as when and where an error message may originate from.
Statistic cookies are used to gather this information. The information collected is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. These “statistic” cookies are used to improve how an application, a website and its pages work.
The c2c website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Alphabet Inc/Google LLC. Google Analytics sets a cookie in order to evaluate your use of the website and compile reports for us on activity on the website.
Google stores the information collected by the cookie on servers outside the EU. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using the c2c website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
Our applications, web locations, website and communications you get from us can contain small invisible images known as “web beacons” or “pixels”. These are used to manage the interaction between you and the online information or email and allow us to assess the effectiveness of the communication.
We also use affiliate cookies. Some of our web-based information will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites, for example delay repay. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is used to tell the other site that you came from on our sites. That other site then may pay us a small amount for the successful referral. The
Internet Advertising Bureau
provides a helpful guide on how affiliate marketing works.
