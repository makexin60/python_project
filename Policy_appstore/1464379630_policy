Disclosures Of Your Personal Data
We may share or disclose your information with the following third parties:
Your Employer, acting as a joint controller, in order that they can administer the Employee Referral Scheme.
Service providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services to us.
Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services to us.
HM Revenue and Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the UK who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
International Transfers
All of our data is stored in the UK on servers based in London. Some of our external third-party service providers may be based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.
Data Security
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access the App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way.
We will collect and store personal data on your Device using application data caches and browser web storage and other technology.
As part of the Services you can share jobs via social networking platforms. Ensure when using these features that you do not submit any personal data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.
Data Retention
We retain personal data for as long as necessary for the relevant activity for which it was provided of collected. This will be for as long as we provide access to the App to you, your account remains open or any period set out in any relevant contract your Employer has with us. In the event that you do not use the App for a period of 12 months then we will treat the account as expired and your personal data may be deleted.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see
Your legal rights
below for further information.
In certain circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. We may also keep some of your data after your account is closed where it is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, resolve disputes or enforce our App Terms.
Please note that after your account has been closed your Employer may still have access to information that has been shared with them during your use of the App and the Service. We do not control this data.
Your Legal Rights
Under certain circumstances you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
Please see the sections below to find out more about these rights:
Request access to your personal data:
Commonly known as a “data subject access request”. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of your personal data:
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data:
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data:
This enables you to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing your personal data:
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
(i)     if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;
(ii)    where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
(iii)   where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
(iv)   you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request transfer or your personal data:
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Right to withdraw consent:
This applies where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
You also have the right to ask us not to continue to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
You can exercise any of these rights at any time by contacting us at Eastwood Care Technologies Ltd, Antrobus House, 18 College Street, Petersfield, Hampshire GU32 2AH or support@carefriends.co.uk

Disclosures Of Your Personal Data
We may share or disclose your information with the following third parties:
Your Employer, acting as a joint controller, in order that they can administer the Employee Referral Scheme.
Service providers act as processors who provide IT and system administration services to us.
Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services to us.
HM Revenue and Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the UK require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
International Transfers
All of our data is stored in Australia on secure servers. Some of our external third-party service providers may be based outside Australia so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside Australia.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of Australia, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in Australia which give personal data the same protection it has in Australia.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of Australia.
Data Security
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access the App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way.
We will collect and store personal data on your Device using application data caches and browser web storage and other technology.
As part of the Services you can share jobs via social networking platforms. Ensure when using these features that you do not submit any personal data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.
Data Retention
We retain personal data for as long as necessary for the relevant activity for which it was provided of collected. This will be for as long as we provide access to the App to you, your account remains open or any period set out in any relevant contract your Employer has with us. In the event that you do not use the App for a period of 12 months then we will treat the account as expired and your personal data may be deleted.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Your legal rights below for further information.
In certain circumstances, we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. We may also keep some of your data after your account is closed where it is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, resolve disputes or enforce our App Terms.
Please note that after your account has been closed your Employer may still have access to information that has been shared with them during your use of the App and the Service. We do not control this data.
Your Legal Rights
Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
Please see the sections below to find out more about these rights:
Request access to your personal data: Commonly known as a “data subject access request”. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of your personal data: This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data: This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data: This enables you to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing your personal data: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
(i)     if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;
(ii)    where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
(iii)   where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
(iv)   you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request transfer of your personal data: We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Right to withdraw consent: This applies where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
You also have the right to ask us not to continue to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
You can exercise any of these rights at any time by contacting us at
