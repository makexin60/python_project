Privacy Policy
Your data is safe with us.

It is important for us to ensure that personal data is kept safe and used legitimately. This policy sets out how we use and protect any personal data that you give us or that we collect when you use our app.

This policy does not deal with how others might use and handle your data, and we recommend that you read their privacy policies to find out how they will use your data and keep it safe. This includes operators of apps and websites to which our app might include links.
​
We may change this policy from time to time by updating this policy and we will let you know when we do so.

WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE PERSONAL DATA

Where a user uploads sensitive information relating to others, the user must obtain explicit consent from the individual to whom the information relates. If we discover that consent has not been obtained we may remove and/or delete the relevant information. If the individual has given consent they can withdraw their consent at any time by emailing us on
privacy@fortunefish.co.uk

4. C
HILDREN AND OTHERS WHOSE DATA IS PROVIDED TO US BY USERS
​
This privacy policy also applies to children and others whose data is provided to us by a user, for example, by uploading a picture which includes such other persons.
​
As it is not possible for us to deal with such individuals personally, we need to rely on you as the user to ensure you have the right to share their personal data with us. We are not able to communicate this privacy policy directly to these individuals and therefore we need users to bring this privacy policy to their attention. We encourage users to do so and to explain the contents of this policy to these individuals. We would be happy to do so ourselves if they contact us.
​
We encourage users to do so and to explain the contents of this policy to these individuals. We would be happy to do so ourselves if they contact us.
​
If we discover that an individual's data has been provided to us by a user without bringing this policy to their attention we will delete the relevant personal data which means that we may delete the photos uploaded by the user.
​
We do not accept responsibility for processing personal data provided to us by users of individuals who are not informed about such processing by the user.
​
Users should be aware that they may also be considered "controllers" of data of others which they provide to us and would therefore be responsible for complying with the various requirements of data protection law.

​
7.
DATA SECURITY
​
Data security is of the utmost importance to us and we are committed to ensuring information we collect from you is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place physical, electronic and operational procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect through the app.
​
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our application; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
​
8.
HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR
​
We will only retain personal data for as long as is required for the purpose for which we collected it.
​
Different retention periods apply to different items of information and this depends on things such as the type of personal data, the reasons why it is processed, as well as legal obligations and business needs to keep the data. As an example, users can generally delete the personal data which they upload onto the app at any time but if the data is needed for investigating a crime or advancing a legal claim the data will be kept until it is no longer needed for that purpose.
​
If you would like more information about the specific retention periods please contact our Data Manager using the contact details provided in section 1.
​
Once the relevant retention period expires, the data and all copies of it will be deleted or physically destroyed, safely and securely.
​
