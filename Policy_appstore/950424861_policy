Introduction
We care about privacy.
We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at its heart. You can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our
Trust Center
.
Our business model is different from that of companies that collect your personal information to monetize such data. We collect and use personal information to allow us to provide our products and services to our clients and end users. In most cases, we do this at the direction of our clients. We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition.
See Vendors, partners & other types of disclosures
for more details on how we may disclose personal information in the context of changes to our business structure.
We are a proud signatory of the Privacy Pledge 2020, a member of the Future of Privacy Forum, and our key products (including Blackboard, Student and Reach) are ISO 27001/27017/27018/27701 and SOC 2 certified.
This privacy statement applies to the personal information we collect about you through our Anthology websites. It also applies to our client marketing and engagement activities such as contacting the relevant staff or clients by email, mail, or by telephone.
This privacy statement does not apply if you are a user of an institution (e.g., a school, college, or university) and we are providing our products and services to you on the institution’s behalf. In this case, we are considered a processor and your institution’s privacy statement governs the use of personal information.
This Statement applies to all our services that we provide directly to you.
Whether you are browsing our websites, receive our newsletters, or use an online trial version of our products, this Statement applies to the use of personal information for all our products and services that we provide directly to you as a so-called ‘data controller.’
When your institution’s privacy statement/policy applies.
If you are an end-user of our client and we are providing our products and services to you on our client’s (your institution’s) behalf, we are considered a ‘data processor.’ In this case, our Statement does not apply. Rather, your institution’s privacy statement applies. Our Privacy Statement also does not affect the terms of any agreements between us and your institution (or any other client or third party), nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between you and your institution.
Who we are.
When we refer to “us”, “we”, “our”, or
“Anthology”
in this Statement, we mean Anthology Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. For our processing as a controller in Colombia, the controlling entity is Consultora Nivel 7 S.A.S.
Changes to this Statement.
From time to time we will need to update this Statement to reflect changes to our products and services, the way we operate, or to meet new legal and regulatory requirements. You will find the latest version of this Statement at
www.anthology.com/trust-center/privacy-statement
. We will explain changes to this Statement on the

How we use your information depends on your relationship with us
What types of personal information we collect and how we use it will depend on your relationship with us. The other sections in our Statement apply to all our activities.
Website users
This section only applies to the use of personal information related to our own websites (e.g.,
anthology.com
). It does not apply to any products and websites we provide on behalf of our clients. Please visit
End user of an institution that uses our products
for information on how we use personal information of our clients’ end users.
Anthology has various websites for different services and geographies that are accessible to anyone. You generally can visit our websites without having to log in or otherwise identify yourself. On some of our websites, you may need to log in to benefit from the service or to make use of all the functionalities and be able to communicate with us or other Anthology users, such as with our Community website and our client support portals.
Information we collect
Directly from you.
Some of our websites require you to sign up for an account. When you do, we ask you for information, such as your name and email address, that we need to set up your account. Often you can also voluntarily provide additional information, such as a photo or biographical information, to make better use of our websites. We also collect information you provide by registering for events, completing forms or surveys on our websites, or giving us your business card. If you provide additional content through user forums, for example, when you communicate with others on our Community site, we may link this information with your personal information if you are logged in.
Indirectly from you.
We collect information about the pages you visit and how you access and use our websites using cookies and third-party analytics tools. This information includes information about the device(s) you use to access the websites including unique device identifiers, IP address, operating system, browser, and cookies. Depending on your device settings, we may also collect information about your geographical location. Learn more about our use of cookies in our
Cookie Statement
.
Information from third parties.
We receive information from affiliates in our Anthology group of companies, our partners, and other third parties that we use to enhance the website experience and promote our products and services. For example, we will receive information from some third parties about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
How we use this information
We use this information to provide and improve our website services as follows.
Analytics and marketing.
We analyze usage information for sales and marketing purposes and for trends about our visitors and their demographics and how they use our websites. This analysis is necessary to further our legitimate interest in understanding our users and how they interact with us and our websites, improving our websites, and communication with you (including for marketing purposes).
Learn more about how we use personal information for client engagement and marketing
.
Personalization.
For some of our websites we also use your information to personalize the pages, which is necessary to provide more contextually relevant information as you browse our websites. For example, if you have indicated your primary industry or your job title, we may present content related to your role or industry as your browse our websites and return to them.
Communication.
If you use websites with logins, we use the contact details you provided to communicate with you and to let you communicate with us and other Anthology users. Typically, we use information in this way because it is required to provide this service to you and because it is in our legitimate interests to ensure our services are being offered in a manner that meets our high standards.
We keep website usage information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes described above. This period of time will vary depending on the services and websites you use and how you interact with us. Account information is kept until you delete the account and for a limited period afterwards. Where you provide information in forms, the information is kept only as long as required. For example, we may need to keep a record of the correspondence with you if you have made a complaint for as long as it is necessary to protect us from any legal claim. Similarly, if you unsubscribe from receiving marketing communications from us, we will keep a record of this to ensure you do not receive such communications in the future.
Who we share this information with
Third-party tools.
Where we use third-party tools (for example to understand how our websites are used and make sure you see relevant ads and campaigns on other websites), these third parties will have access to some of your personal information. This includes analytics tools such as Google Analytics and advertising tools such as Facebook Business.

End user of an institution that uses our products
Your institution decides how your personal information is used.
We provide most of our products and services to end-users of an institution as a so-called ‘data processor’ on behalf of our clients (for example, school, districts, universities, and corporations). This means that the main responsibility for data privacy compliance lies with your institution as the ‘data controller.’ It also means that your institution’s privacy statement applies to the use of your personal information (instead of ours). Your institution determines what information we collect through our products and services and how it is used, and we process your information according to your institution’s instructions and the terms of our contracts with your institution.
Read your institution’s privacy statement.
The following section is for informational purposes and describes how your information is generally used when we provide products and services to you on behalf of a client. How your information is used depends on your institution, so you should read your institution’s privacy statement.
Information we collect
Information your institution provides to us.
Typically, our products and services integrate with your institution’s systems. As such, your institution will provide us with information about you to set up and maintain your account or for us to be able to provide the product or service. This includes information in the following data categories:
Account information:
The exact data elements will depend on the product, but often we receive your name, email address, student ID, account credentials, and courses you are enrolled in when we initially set up the products and services for your institution. We will receive regular updated information to keep your account information accurate and up to date.
Additional contact details:
For some products, we also receive your phone number to send you text (SMS) notifications.
Application, admission, visa, enrollment, and financial aid information:
If your institution uses our student information system, admissions, enrollment helpdesk, financial aid support and similar products and services, your institution will make this type of information available to us to provide these services.
Payroll information:
If we provide Anthology Payroll to your institution, we will receive payroll related information such as salary, tax, and benefit information from your institution.
Directly from you.
Depending on the products and services you use, we will collect the following data categories directly from you:
Profile information:
We collect your first and last name, email address, and similar contact data when you provide or update this information in our products. In many products and services, you can choose to provide more information for your account profile, such as your photograph and other biographical content, which may be shared with others through the products and services. In some products, you can choose to provide your phone number to receive notifications via text (SMS). In some of our products, such as our Blackboard Mobile App, you can also give us permission to access your contact list on your mobile device. This allows us to match your contacts to users in Blackboard and display their photo from the users contact list in discussion boards.
Credentials:
Our products and services often integrate with your institution’s systems and rely on the credentials your institution uses. Where this is not the case, we will collect passwords, password hints, and similar security information that we use for authentication and account access.
Content and activity:
We collect data about your responses to quizzes, your assignments and other course work, and files you submit or upload as well as your activity and actions within our products and services. In some products, you can also provide comments in discussion forums and chats and send messages to your peers and instructors. If you are an instructor, we also collect information about your grading, feedback and assessments, and similar actions within our products.
Audio and video recordings.
Some of our products allow you (as a student or instructor) to submit audio and video feedback, and we collect the related information, including metadata.
Financial information.
If we provide financial aid support on behalf of your institution, we will collect financial information that is required to help you with the related applications.
Payment data.
For some of our products and services, we collect data necessary to process your payments, including your credit card number and the security code associated with your credit card. We maintain the applicable Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance levels for such data.
Support.
When you or your institution contacts us for support, we may collect limited information about you that you or a representative of your institution provides to us. We use this information only to assist with client support cases on behalf of your institution. When you contact us, your phone conversations or chat sessions with our client support teams may be monitored and recorded for training and quality purposes. Some of our products and services such as the Blackboard Mobile App also have feedback functionality that collects limited information about your device, the product, and your institution such as your user ID or school ID when you provide feedback.
Indirectly from you.
We collect information on how you use our products and services. Depending on which product or service you use, this may include the following data categories:

Information from social media sites.
When you interact with our products and services through social media services, such as when you log in through Facebook, use Cloud/Social Profile, or share Anthology content on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, we may receive information from these social media companies. For instance, when you log in to a service using a social media account, the social media company will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information from your social media profile with us, which could include your name, email address, age, gender, position, and profile picture. If your institution has enabled Cloud Profiles or Social Profiles, you can also connect your Anthology profile with your Facebook and Twitter account and use information from those accounts for your Anthology profile. The data we receive is dependent upon the social media service and your privacy settings with the social media service.
How we use this information
On behalf of your institution.
We use your information on behalf of and under the instruction of your institution, which is the data controller. We use the information in accordance with our agreement with your institution to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the products and services.

Analytics and Recommendations.
Providing our products and services to your institution may include analytics functionalities. Among other things, such functionalities can indicate your performance compared to that of your peers, project your future performance, and provide this information to instructors and other staff of your institution.

Children’s privacy (COPPA)
We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 in the United States unless and until the relevant institution has provided consent and authorization for a student under 13 to use the products and services and for us to collect information from such student. Where a client institution instructs us to collect personal information from children under the age of 13, we collect, use, process and retain such information solely to provide the educational services on behalf of the client and for the purposes set forth in our agreement with the client. We collect only as much information as is necessary to provide the service and the client may access, delete, or withdraw consent for continued processing of the child's information at any time. If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information of a child under the age of 13, please contact your educational institution directly.
Please contact us at
privacy@anthology.com
if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without proper consent. This will allow us to delete such information as soon as possible.
Security
We take your privacy seriously and are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal information you provide to us. We employ a variety of physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to protect personal information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. We have a dedicated information security program and work hard to continuously enhance our technical and operational security measures.
Our measures consider the sensitivity of the information we collect, use, and store, and the current state of technology. Our security measures include data encryption at rest and in transit, firewalls, data use, and access limitations for our personnel and vendors and physical access controls to our facilities.
All products and services that use payment data maintain the applicable Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance levels. Our compliance with the PCI standards is validated during annual audits that are conducted by external auditors (so-called ‘Qualified Security Assessors’).
Data transfers & additional regional and country information
Data transfers
Anthology is a global company headquartered in the United States. For many of our products, we use a regional hosting strategy, but we may need to access your information from locations outside of your region and country, including from the United States and the Netherlands, for support and maintenance purposes where permitted under applicable law and our contract with your institution. We understand the importance of complying with data transfer requirements. We use approved data transfer mechanisms, such as the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission ("SCCs") and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF to ensure the adequate protection of your information when it is transferred. We detail our compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles in our
Data Privacy Framework Statement

Our approach to data privacy
We care about privacy. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We are a proud signatory of the Student Privacy Pledge, ISO 27701 certified, EU – U.S. Data Privacy Framework certified, and a member of the Future of Privacy Forum.
Our data privacy commitments
Our clients own their data.
We understand that personal information of our clients’ users is only entrusted to us. We have a responsibility to protect it vigilantly and only use it in accordance with all applicable data privacy laws and as agreed with our clients.
We believe data privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals.
We were therefore among the first to adopt the high EU data privacy standards globally.
We do not sell student data.
We do not sell student personal information to third parties or data brokers or use or disclose student personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
Innovation guided by privacy by design.
We help our clients with data-driven insights and personalization. Our privacy team works closely with our product teams on these innovations, and we apply a privacy by design approach.
Our data privacy program
We have a dedicated Global Data Privacy Program that uses the high EU GDPR standards as a global baseline to ensure we can meet our obligations and can assist our clients with their obligations. Our key products are also ISO 27001, 27017, 27018 and 27701 certified.
Good data privacy practices require a solid governance model. At Anthology, data privacy and security are a Board priority, and our data privacy governance model ensures that senior management oversees and supports our data privacy and security efforts through the Compliance Committee and the Security and Privacy Risk Council, a subcommittee of the Compliance Committee. A network of Data Privacy Champions supports our Global Privacy Officer and the Privacy Team. Staff are made aware of the importance of data privacy and their responsibilities under our internal data privacy policies through initial and regular data privacy and security training and awareness campaigns.
Privacy by design
Our privacy by design process helps ensure that material changes to how we use personal information in our products are reviewed from a data privacy perspective from the start and that the impact on the privacy of individuals is minimized. This is achieved through product privacy requirements, our internal privacy by design, data protection impact assessments and close cooperation between the privacy and product teams.
Responsibility for our Vendors
Anthology is responsible for the data privacy practices of our vendors. Our vendor risk management processes help ensure that:
We have robust contracts that include a data processing addendum in place with our subprocessors imposing materially equivalent provisions that we have in place with our clients.
New vendors with access to personal information need to complete vendor security and data privacy due diligence questionnaire which allows us to understand their security and privacy practices, risks and standards.
Vendors with access to Anthology-managed systems are required to follow Anthology-internal access control and identity and authorization policies.
Vendors need to access Anthology resources through approved mechanisms.
Vendors have restricted access controls on traffic, users, and assets.
You can find the list of our subprocessors at
www.anthology.com/trust-center/sub-processors

Our
Privacy Statement
explains in detail how we process personal information for our own purposes (as a controller) and how we typically process personal information of our clients and their end users (as a processor). You can also find more details about our data privacy approach program in our

This supplemental U.S. State Privacy Notice only applies to individual residents of the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Texas, Utah and Virginia and only where we act as a ‘business’ or ‘controller’ (e.g., for our websites and marketing). Where we provide our products and services to consumers on behalf of an institution, we process that personal information as a ‘service provider’ or ‘processor’ in accordance with our contractual agreements. In that case, the institution’s privacy notice governs the use of personal information.
We collect personal information from and about you for a variety of purposes and may disclose it to our service providers, business partners and other third parties as described below and in our
Privacy Statement
.

We do not sell your personal information for profit. However, we do engage in certain data disclosure activities that may be considered ‘sales’ under the broad definitions of the CCPA.

Our Commitment to Privacy
We care about privacy. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart. You can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our

Scope of Notice
For residents of the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Texas, Utah and Virginia ("consumers" or "you"): This U.S. State Privacy Notice (the “Notice”) supplements the information in our
Privacy Statement
and provides additional information about our personal information processing practices relating to individual residents of these states.
This Notice only reflects how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information for our own purposes (e.g., for our websites and marketing) and are acting as a ‘business’ or ‘controller’. Where we provide our products and services to consumers on behalf of our clients, we are acting as a ‘service provider’ or ‘processor’ and process personal information under the terms of a contract with our institutional clients. In this case, the client’s privacy notice governs the use of personal information and the rights and choices the client’s end users may have with regard to their personal information. For example, when we process Student Data on behalf of our client institution, we are acting as a service provider, or a “School Official” under FERPA, and we retain, use, and disclose the Student Data in accordance with our written agreement with the client.
For the purposes of this Notice, personal information does not include:
Publicly available information from government records
Deidentified, aggregated or anonymized information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or linked to you
Information relating to our employees, contractors, and other personnel (which is governed by a separate privacy notice)
Any terms we use in this Notice that aren’t defined in this Notice or our Privacy Statement will have the same meaning as in the applicable state data protection laws.

Anthology, Inc. (main) plus:
Blackboard, LLC.
Purpose
The purpose of this Anthology Data Privacy Framework Statement (“Statement”) is to outline how we comply with the Principles with respect to the personal data we collect. If you would like to obtain additional information regarding our privacy practices in connection with information collected on this website in general, please refer to our
Privacy Statement
. If there is any conflict between this Statement and the Privacy Statement, this Statement shall prevail.
Scope
This Statement applies to any personal information received by Anthology and its affiliates in the U.S. from the European Economic Area and the UK in reliance on the DPF.
Anthology Data Processing Activities
At times we act as a data processor or a data controller when processing personal data transferred from the European Economic Area and the UK, depending on the Anthology product or service. Though the types of data we collect and process may vary depending on the product and our clients’ preferences, data we collect typically includes personal data relating to learners and other end users of our products and services and schools/organizations, billing and payments information, web browsing behavior and other information relating to a user’s device used to access the services, and other information as described in our
Privacy Statement
. We process this data for the purposes of: providing our products and services; billing and payments; client service and product support; communications and marketing; analytics to inform and improve our services; and other internal purposes.
Principles
Notice.
We inform individuals about our data collection and processing practices in our
Privacy Statement
, which describes what personal data we collect, the purpose and use of the personal data , the categories of third parties with whom we may share such information (and the purposes for which we do so), the individual’s right to access such information, the choices and means through which the individual may limit the use and disclosure of personal data, and other disclosures consistent with the Notice Principle. Where we process personal data on behalf of an educational or other institution (each an “Institution”) with which end users have a direct relationship, the Institution is generally responsible for providing notices and we will support the Institutions as required for them to provide appropriate notices to their end users.
Choice.
We offer individuals the opportunity to opt-out of personal data (or to provide explicit opt-in consent for sensitive information) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than to our service providers under contract or pursuant to lawful request as set forth below), or (ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected (as set out in our
Privacy Statement
) or subsequently authorized by you if such circumstances arise. You can also opt-out at any time from having your personal data used for direct marketing purposes by following the unsubscribe procedures indicated in the marketing emails and/or by visiting the
Anthology Preference Centre
. For further questions related to the above, you can contact us at
privacy@anthology.com
.
Where we process personal data on behalf of an Institution, we will work with that Institution to comply with any individual’s choices for limiting use or disclosure of personal data.
Accountability for Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties).
Anthology may transfer personal data to certain third parties (as described in our
Privacy Statement
). Where we transfer personal data to a third party, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure the third party processes personal data for limited and specified purposes and in a manner consistent with our DPF obligations. Where the transfer is to a third-party agent acting on our behalf, we may be liable if such third parties fail to meet those obligations.
Security.
We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.
We process personal data in a manner that is compatible with and relevant to the purposes for which it was collected or authorized by individuals. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use. We only retain personal information for as long as is needed for those purposes. Where we receive personal data from an Institution, it will be the Institution that determines those purposes and the applicable retention period.
Access.
EU and UK individuals have the right to reasonable access to the personal data we hold about them. On request, we will also take reasonable steps to correct, update, amend or delete any information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. Where we process personal data on behalf of an Institution, we will direct any individual requests for access or to limit use or disclosure to the Institution, and we will work with such Institution in complying with such requests in accordance with applicable law and our obligations under the DPF.
Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability.
We have established internal mechanisms to verify our ongoing adherence to this Statement. As part of our participation in the DPF, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We encourage individuals covered by this Statement to raise any concerns about our processing of their personal data by contacting us (see below).
Lawful Requests.
We may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Summary
We care about your privacy and have a dedicated data privacy program.
Learn more about our approach to data privacy
.
This supplemental U.S. Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy only applies specifically to individual residents or ‘Consumers’, as defined under applicable U.S. privacy laws regarding consumer health data, of the States of Washington and Nevada (“Consumer Health Privacy Laws”), only where we act as a ‘business’ or ‘controller’ (e.g., for our events). Where we provide our products and services to consumers on behalf of an institution, we process that personal information as a ‘service provider’ or ‘processor’ in accordance with our contractual agreements. In that case, the institution’s privacy notice governs the use of personal information.
We collect Consumer Health Data directly from you that you voluntarily share for specific purposes and may disclose it to third parties as described below.
Depending on your state of residence, you have rights in relation to your personal information.
For any other questions, you can contact us at
privacy@anthology.com
.
Our Commitment to Privacy
We care about privacy. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart. You can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our
Trust Center
.
Consumer Health Data Collection, Use, and Processing
For purposes of this Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy, ‘Consumer Health Data’ is defined under Consumer Health Privacy Laws and includes personal information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a Consumer and that identifies the Consumer’s past, present, or future physical or mental health status.
As a controller, we only collect such data in very limited circumstances and mainly in the context of organizing in-person events. As such, we (or our vendors and partners on our behalf) may collect the following categories of consumer health data directly from you that you voluntarily share:
Category of Consumer Health Data Collected
Sources of Information
Dietary restrictions, intolerances, and food allergies.
Directly from you
Accessibility requirements.
Directly from you
Photos, videos, and voice recordings
as part of event coverage (which may be considered biometric information under applicable Consumer Health Privacy Laws).
Directly from you
Any related information provided while at the in-person events
organized by Anthology that may be used to infer or derive data related to the above-mentioned categories or other Consumer Health Data.
Directly from you
Purposes for Collection and Use
We will use Consumer Health Data to organize and conduct in-person events (e.g., our client conference Anthology Together) and undertake activities to verify and ensure we support dietary, and accessibility needs of the attendees to such events, to the extent the use of the consumer’s Health Data is reasonably necessary and proportionate for these purposes.
We will use Consumer Health Data, namely, photos, videos, and voice recordings as part of event coverage for both archival and promotional purposes.
Processing
We may process Consumer Health Data that we collect from you by methods including, but not limited to, collecting, using, storing, organizing, combining (including with other personal information we collect from you), erasing, filtering, and transmitting data in accordance with this Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy for the purposes listed above.
Consumer Health Data Disclosure, Sale, and Use for Targeted Advertising
Disclosure
We may disclose the categories of Consumer Health Data set forth above, for the purposes described above, with vendors (third parties) that perform services related to the events (e.g., suppliers who provide food and beverages throughout a specific event, suppliers who assist with the venue suitability and adaptation for each of the events) and other partner organizations that support such events. We may also disclose this information to our affiliates and subsidiaries as needed for the organization of the event. In some circumstances, we may also disclose Consumer Health Data: (i) to third parties in connection with a business transaction (such as a merger, acquisition, JV, financing or similar); (ii) to third parties in connection with a legal right or obligation (including the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; to comply with laws or to respond to lawful request and legal processes; to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of other, including to enforce our agreements and policies; to detect, suppress, or prevent fraud; to protect the health and safety of us and others; or as required by applicable law); or (iii) to third parties or the public with your consent or at your direction.
Sales and Targeted Advertising
We do not sell Consumer Health Data for profit as defined by Consumer Health Privacy Laws, and we do not use any Consumer Health Data for targeted advertising.
Your Privacy Rights
Consumer Health Privacy Laws such as the My Health My Data Act provide certain rights with respect to Consumer Health Data, including rights to access, delete, or withdraw consent relating to such data, subject to certain exceptions.
The Right to Withdraw Consent
You may have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing activities for your Consumer Health Data.
The Right to Request Deletion
You may have the right to request that we delete your Consumer Health Data and that all third parties to whom we have disclosed your Consumer Health Data delete such data.
The Right to Confirm
You may have the right to confirm whether Anthology is collecting, sharing, or selling your Consumer Health Data and to access such data.
You can request to exercise such rights using the mechanisms described below.
To Submit Your Privacy Rights Request
We will need to verify your identity before processing most requests, which may require us to obtain additional personal information from you. We will only use such personal information to review and comply with your request. In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate information in our systems, or as permitted by law. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for our decision.
To exercise your privacy rights
, please submit a request by emailing
privacy@anthology.com
describing your privacy rights request.

Recruitment Privacy Notice
Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace Statement
Anthology cares about data privacy and takes the protection of your personal information very seriously.
This Notice explains how we handle personal information about our job applicants and to explain the rights that they
						have under data protection law. In this Notice, we refer to this type of information as
“Recruitment Data.”
This Notice applies to applications submitted via our Anthology Careers website and third parties, such as recruitment
						agencies and job boards. It also applies to applications submitted via other means, such as by post, email, or social
						media channels and to instances where we contact you for a position based on a recommendation or based on information
						available through our Talent Community services, on your social media profile or personal website.
“Anthology” means Anthology Inc. and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates (e.g., Blackboard LLC), as existing from
						time to time. Anthology is also referred to in this Notice as
“we”
,
“us”
or
“our.”
1. What recruitment data do we collect?
We will generally only collect Recruitment Data in the recruitment process that is necessary to assess you for the
						position for which you have applied. This may include the following categories of data:
Application information:
This information will generally tell us who you are and help build a
							picture of your capabilities and suitability for certain positions. This type of information may include your name,
							contact information, current employer, information contained in your CV/résumé (e.g., professional qualifications,
							previous employment history, place of residence, current base compensation, additional bonuses and/or commission,
							work authorization status, and personal interests and experiences), information you provided as part of our Talent
							Community services or contained in your publicly available social media accounts or personal websites or accounts
							(e.g., LinkedIn or X (fka Twitter), information about the type of work and projects you have been involved with, and
							any other information you may wish to provide to us as part of your application.
Recruitment process information:
This is information collected as a result of the recruitment
							process, such as your interview and information provided by your references.
Future opportunities information:
This is information collected in order to keep in touch with you
							about future job opportunities at Anthology, such as your name, email, LinkedIn profile, location, field of
							expertise and the kind of role you are interested in.
Careers website information:
This is information related to your use of our careers website, for
							example your IP address. This information may be collected using cookies and similar technology. For more
							information about how we use cookies and similar technologies on our websites please see our
Privacy Statement
.
Personal information about criminal convictions or medical information will only be sought where permitted by
						applicable law.
We generally receive Recruitment Data either (a) directly from you (for instance when you provide information as part
						of your application or during the recruitment process) or (b) from third parties (for instance from recruitment
						agencies). We will indicate where the information we have requested is mandatory or optional. Should you decide not to
						provide information which we have indicated is mandatory, this may mean that in some circumstances we are unable to
						process your application.
2. What will we do with your recruitment data?
The main purposes for which we use your Recruitment Data include:
Supporting and Processing your Application
, for example, so we can assess your ability to meet the
							job specification, in order to shortlist applicants and to verify references and professional qualifications
							provided by applicants.
Improving our Application Process
, for example to ensure that our careers website is user-friendly
							and contains appropriate and helpful information.
Security Management
, for example to ensure the security of our premises, assets, information,
							employees, and other personnel.
Legal and Regulatory Compliance
, for example to ensure compliance with health & safety
							requirements and other legal or fiscal obligations, or in connection with litigation or an internal investigation or
							audit and to ensure compliance with our corporate policies including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the
							International Anti-Corruption Policy, as well as equal opportunities/affirmative action requirements and monitoring.
We may verify the Recruitment Data you provide during the recruitment process and/or collect personal information
						about you from third party sources to assist with our “Pre-Employment Checks.” If this occurs:
You will be told in advance which aspects of your Recruitment Data will be verified including an explanation of how
							the
Pre-Employment Checks
will be carried out; and
Information about criminal convictions (if collected) or medical information will only be collected through official
							authorised sources and in accordance with applicable law.
Where it is necessary and appropriate for the role you have applied for, we may also require you to undertake drug and
						alcohol testing prior to commencing your employment with us.
We will only process your Recruitment Data where we have a legal basis for doing so. Generally, we will be processing
						it to help us to decide whether to enter into a contract of employment with you. At other times, we will be processing
						your Recruitment Data because you have consented to us doing so. In which case you can withdraw such consent at any
						point.
We may also process your Recruitment Data to comply with our legal obligations or because it is in our legitimate
						business interests to do so (for example, where it is necessary to understand our applicants in sufficient detail so
						we can operate an effective recruitment process).
3. Who is your recruitment data disclosed to?
(a) Within Anthology
We restrict access to Recruitment Data to personnel who have a “need to know” such information. For example, certain
						individuals within Anthology will have access to your Recruitment Data in order to process your application and manage
						the recruitment process (this may include individuals in our Recruitment team and individuals to whom you would report
						if your application is successful).
(b) Outside Anthology
We share Recruitment Data with authorised third-party service providers to conduct and manage the recruitment process.
						For example, we may share your Recruitment Data with such service providers in order to conduct screening and
						verification of your application and the information you have provided to us. This includes verifying academic and
						professional qualifications. We also share Recruitment Data with the service providers of our recruitment related IT
						applications. Moreover, we will only disclose your Recruitment Data to other third parties in the following
						circumstances:
when required to do so by law;
in response to a legitimate request for assistance by the police or other law enforcement agency; and/or
to seek legal advice from our external lawyers or in connection with litigation with a third party.
4. How long will we retain your recruitment data?
We keep your Recruitment Data in accordance with our internal retention policies and procedures. Typically, if you are
						unsuccessful in your application with us (or if you reject the position), we will keep your contact details for 2
						years if you are an non US applicant or7 years for US applicants. We will retain other Recruitment Data for up to 1
						year unless we have your permission to keep your Recruitment Data on file so that we may contact you again if another
						suitable position arises – in this situation we will retain such Recruitment Data for up to 5 years from the date of
						the last contact between you and Anthology.
5. Where do we store your recruitment data?
Applicants in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and the UK should be aware that their Recruitment Data may be
						transferred to, and stored in the United States and other countries, which may have less strict data protection laws,
						when compared to those in Europe. It may also be processed by staff or our vendors in other non-EEA jurisdictions
						which also have less strict data protection laws.
Whenever we transfer your Recruitment Data outside of the EEA or the UK, we will take legally required steps to ensure
						that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your Recruitment Data and to make sure it is treated securely and in
						accordance with this Notice. If you are located in the EEA or the UK, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards
						which we have put in place to protect your Recruitment Data and privacy rights in these circumstances.
6. Exercising your rights
Depending on the applicable data protection laws, you may have the right to request access to, rectification, or
						erasure of, the Recruitment Data we hold about you. You may also have the right to object to or restrict certain types
						of processing of your Recruitment Data and request to receive a machine-readable copy of the Recruitment Data you have
						provided to us.
If you notice an error in your application that you would like to correct, please contact us using the contact
						information below.
Any request to exercise one of these rights will be assessed by us on a case-by-case basis. There may be circumstances
						in which we are not legally required to comply with your request or because of relevant legal exemptions provided for
						in applicable data protection legislation.
7. Contact us
If you have any question regarding this notice or concerns about the way in which we have handled your Recruitment
						Data you should contact us at
privacy@anthology.com
in the first instance.
						If you are still dissatisfied, you have the right to complain to your local Data Protection Authority in certain
						jurisdictions.
8. Updates to this notice
We may change this Notice from time to time in order to reflect changes in the law, regulatory guidance or our data
						privacy practices in compliance with the law. When this happens and where required by law, we will provide you with a
						new or an updated notice detailing how the use of your Recruitment Data is changing and, if necessary, obtain your
						consent for the further processing.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google
to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

Delete your content from
specific Google services

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data

We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements

Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.

Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more

ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
