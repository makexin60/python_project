Privacy Policy
Information Collected
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the PixelDesk
        applications and services for iPhone, and other devices and platforms.
PixelDesk occasionally needs to collect information for convenience, practicality, or technical requirements.
        This information includes:
Your chosen username, which may be your actual email address. We encourage you to use your actual email address
            to make password recovery possible.
Your chosen password. A hash of your password is stored in the PixelDesk
            database, and the plain-text password is only used when authenticating. All traffic between PixelDesk devices
            and its servers is SSL encrypted.
Your iOS Push Token. Your push token is provided by iOS and it contains no identity information and is simply a unique
            identifier for your device or devices. PixelDesk will correlate your device token(s) with your chosen username
            to facilitate pushing articles or links from the PixelDesk browser extension to your device(s).
Usage Statistics. Basic usage statistics (i.e. how often the app is opened) are retained by PixelDesk in order to
            determine user engagement.
Like most Web services, PixelDesk also collects and stores information automatically and through the use of electronic
        tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider,
        your IP address, and information provided by and about your Internet browser. As we adopt additional technology, we
        may also gather similar information through other means.
We may also use local storage. Among other things, we may use local storage provided by your device or web browser
        for purposes of storing your username and password hash to spare you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.
