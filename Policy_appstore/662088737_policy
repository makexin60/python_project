About This Privacy Policy
We created this privacy policy to tell you:
What personal information we might collect about you;
What we might do with that personal information; and
Your choices about the personal information you provide.
This policy covers our websites, mobile apps, services provided through these platforms or otherwise accessed by a user (such as our counselling and well-being services) and any other interactions you may have with us (such as by telephone, email, or in person). This policy specifically covers our handling of personal information (including, in the case of some of our services,
sensitive
personal information) relating to identifiable individuals and does not apply to proprietary business information.
Some of our services are provided on behalf of our clients, which means our client remains primarily responsible for your personal information. For instance, we may be providing services on behalf of your employer or plan sponsor. In these circumstances, we may re-direct a query about our use of your personal information to our client.
Getting Your Consent
As part of using our services or interacting with us, we may collect and process some details about you. When we do so, we will collect, use or share your personal information with your consent for the purposes we’ve informed you of, or as may be otherwise permitted or required by law. Your consent can be express or implied (where this is permitted by law). For example, by participating in your benefits plan, you consent to TELUS Health’s collection and use of your personal information to provide services to that plan. In some situations, we may get consent directly from you (including as described in this privacy policy). In other situations, we may rely on the consent you provided to your employer or benefits sponsor.
You can withhold or withdraw your consent for us to collect, use or share your personal information (to the extent our processing is based on your consent in accordance with applicable law). The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Depending on the circumstances, however, withdrawal of your consent may impact our ability to serve you, or in the case of administering benefits, it may prevent us from processing your claims.
Where We Get Your Information
We collect personal information in the following ways:
Directly from you;
From your use of TELUS Health’s services, programmes, websites and apps;
From your employer, association, insurer or benefits plan sponsor;
When you attend a TELUS Health site or event;
When you apply for a position at TELUS Health;
If you contact us with a complaint or query;
When you engage with us over social media; and/or
From legally authorised third parties.
Children’s Information
We will not knowingly collect, use or share personal information if you are under the age of majority in your area without the permission of your parent or guardian. If you are underage and want to access our counselling and wellness services, your parent or guardian needs to contact TELUS Health on your behalf.

About This Privacy Policy
We created this privacy policy to tell you:
What personal information we might collect about you;
What we might do with that personal information; and
Your choices about the personal information you provide.
This policy covers our websites, mobile apps, services provided through these platforms or otherwise accessed by a user (such as our counselling and well-being services) and any other interactions you may have with us (such as by telephone, email, or in person). This policy specifically covers our handling of personal information (including, in the case of some of our services,
sensitive
personal information) relating to identifiable individuals and does not apply to proprietary business information.
Some of our services are provided on behalf of our clients, which means our client remains primarily responsible for your personal information. For instance, we may be providing services on behalf of your employer or plan sponsor. In these circumstances, we may re-direct a query about our use of your personal information to our client.
Getting Your Consent
As part of using our services or interacting with us, we may collect and process some details about you. When we do so, we will collect, use or share your personal information with your consent for the purposes we’ve informed you of, or as may be otherwise permitted or required by law. Your consent can be express or implied (where this is permitted by law). For example, by participating in your benefits plan, you consent to TELUS Health’s collection and use of your personal information to provide services to that plan. In some situations, we may get consent directly from you (including as described in this privacy policy). In other situations, we may rely on the consent you provided to your employer or benefits sponsor.
You can withhold or withdraw your consent for us to collect, use or share your personal information (to the extent our processing is based on your consent in accordance with applicable law). The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Depending on the circumstances, however, withdrawal of your consent may impact our ability to serve you, or in the case of administering benefits, it may prevent us from processing your claims.
Where We Get Your Information
We collect personal information in the following ways:
Directly from you;
From your use of TELUS Health’s services, programmes, websites and apps;
From your employer, association, insurer or benefits plan sponsor;
When you attend a TELUS Health site or event;
When you apply for a position at TELUS Health;
If you contact us with a complaint or query;
When you engage with us over social media; and/or
From legally authorised third parties.
Children’s Information
We will not knowingly collect, use or share personal information if you are under the age of majority in your area without the permission of your parent or guardian. If you are underage and want to access our counselling and wellness services, your parent or guardian needs to contact TELUS Health on your behalf.

About This Privacy Policy
We created this privacy policy to tell you:
What personal information we might collect about you;
What we might do with that personal information; and
Your choices about the personal information you provide.
This policy covers our websites, mobile apps, services provided through these platforms or otherwise accessed by a user (such as our counselling and well-being services) and any other interactions you may have with us (such as by telephone, email, or in person). This policy specifically covers our handling of personal information (including, in the case of some of our services,
sensitive
personal information) relating to identifiable individuals and does not apply to proprietary business information.
Some of our services are provided on behalf of our clients, which means our client remains primarily responsible for your personal information. For instance, we may be providing services on behalf of your employer or plan sponsor. In these circumstances, we may re-direct a query about our use of your personal information to our client.
Getting Your Consent
As part of using our services or interacting with us, we may collect and process some details about you. When we do so, we will collect, use or share your personal information with your consent for the purposes we’ve informed you of, or as may be otherwise permitted or required by law. Your consent can be express or implied (where this is permitted by law). For example, by participating in your benefits plan, you consent to TELUS Health’s collection and use of your personal information to provide services to that plan. In some situations, we may get consent directly from you (including as described in this privacy policy). In other situations, we may rely on the consent you provided to your employer or benefits sponsor.
You can withhold or withdraw your consent for us to collect, use or share your personal information (to the extent our processing is based on your consent in accordance with applicable law). The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Depending on the circumstances, however, withdrawal of your consent may impact our ability to serve you, or in the case of administering benefits, it may prevent us from processing your claims.
Where We Get Your Information
We collect personal information in the following ways:
Directly from you;
From your use of TELUS Health’s services, programmes, websites and apps;
From your employer, association, insurer or benefits plan sponsor;

When you engage with us over social media; and/or
From legally authorised third parties.

About This Privacy Policy
We created this privacy policy to tell you:
What personal information we might collect about you;
What we might do with that personal information; and
Your choices about the personal information you provide.
This policy covers our websites, mobile apps, services provided through these platforms or otherwise accessed by a user (such as our counselling and well-being services) and any other interactions you may have with us (such as by telephone, email, or in person). This policy specifically covers our handling of personal information (including, in the case of some of our services,
sensitive
personal information) relating to identifiable individuals and does not apply to proprietary business information.
Some of our services are provided on behalf of our clients, which means our client remains primarily responsible for your personal information. For instance, we may be providing services on behalf of your employer or plan sponsor. In these circumstances, we may re-direct a query about our use of your personal information to our client.
Getting Your Consent
As part of using our services or interacting with us, we may collect and process some details about you. When we do so, we will collect, use or share your personal information with your consent for the purposes we’ve informed you of, or as may be otherwise permitted or required by law. Your consent can be express or implied (where this is permitted by law). For example, by participating in your benefits plan, you consent to TELUS Health’s collection and use of your personal information to provide services to that plan. In some situations, we may get consent directly from you (including as described in this privacy policy). In other situations, we may rely on the consent you provided to your employer or benefits sponsor.
You can withhold or withdraw your consent for us to collect, use or share your personal information (to the extent our processing is based on your consent in accordance with applicable law). The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Depending on the circumstances, however, withdrawal of your consent may impact our ability to serve you, or in the case of administering benefits, it may prevent us from processing your claims.
Where We Get Your Information
We collect personal information in the following ways:
Directly from you;
From your use of TELUS Health’s services, programmes, websites and apps;
From your employer, association, insurer or benefits plan sponsor;
When you attend a TELUS Health site or event;
When you apply for a position at TELUS Health;
If you contact us with a complaint or query;
When you engage with us over social media; and/or
From legally authorised third parties.
Children’s Information
We will not knowingly collect, use or share personal information if you are under the age of majority in your area without the permission of your parent or guardian. If you are underage and want to access our counselling and wellness services, your parent or guardian needs to contact TELUS Health on your behalf.

About This Privacy Policy
We created this privacy policy to tell you:
What personal information we might collect about you;
What we might do with that personal information; and
Your choices about the personal information you provide.
This policy covers our websites, mobile apps, services provided through these platforms or otherwise accessed by a user (such as our counselling and well-being services) and any other interactions you may have with us (such as by telephone, email, or in person). This policy specifically covers our handling of personal information (including, in the case of some of our services,
sensitive
personal information) relating to identifiable individuals and does not apply to proprietary business information.
Some of our services are provided on behalf of our clients, which means our client remains primarily responsible for your personal information. For instance, we may be providing services on behalf of your employer or plan sponsor. In these circumstances, we may re-direct a query about our use of your personal information to our client.
Getting Your Consent
As part of using our services or interacting with us, we may collect and process some details about you. When we do so, we will collect, use or share your personal information with your consent for the purposes we’ve informed you of, or as may be otherwise permitted or required by law. Your consent can be express or implied (where this is permitted by law). For example, by participating in your benefits plan, you consent to TELUS Health’s collection and use of your personal information to provide services to that plan. In some situations, we may get consent directly from you (including as described in this privacy policy). In other situations, we may rely on the consent you provided to your employer or benefits sponsor.
You can withhold or withdraw your consent for us to collect, use or share your personal information (to the extent our processing is based on your consent in accordance with applicable law). The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Depending on the circumstances, however, withdrawal of your consent may impact our ability to serve you, or in the case of administering benefits, it may prevent us from processing your claims.
Where We Get Your Information
We collect personal information in the following ways:
Directly from you;
From your use of TELUS Health’s services, programmes, websites and apps;
From your employer, association, insurer or benefits plan sponsor;
When you attend a TELUS Health site or event;
When you apply for a position at TELUS Health;
If you contact us with a complaint or query;
When you engage with us over social media; and/or
From legally authorised third parties.
Children’s Information
We will not knowingly collect, use or share personal information if you are under the age of majority in your area without the permission of your parent or guardian. If you are underage and want to access our counselling and wellness services, your parent or guardian needs to contact TELUS Health on your behalf.
What Information We Collect and Why
Our collection and use of your personal information depends on what products and services your sponsoring organisation chooses to make available to you, which TELUS Health products and services you choose to participate in, and what information you choose to provide to us.
We may collect and use the following types of information for the following purposes:
