Overview
This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the ChromaMagic app for iPhone, iPad and Macs.
We Collect No Personal Information Using Our Applications
We do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in ChromaMagic.
Individual settings relating to the ChromaMagic app are stored only on your device. You might also be asked to provide access to your photo library, local files, or camera, but this is only so you can open your photos in ChromaMagic.  We donâ€™t process that information at all and have no access to it.
In addition, if you take a photo using ChromaMagic, location data is saved in the image, but we have no access to that data and it is not shared with anyone unless you yourself choose to share the image.
App Analytics
To help us better understand how people use the ChromaMagic app and to continue improving it, we use analytics information provided by App Store Connect. These services provide generalized data about our apps, such as app usage patterns, transactional, and other anonymized statistics. This data is completely anonymous and cannot personally identify you in any way.
