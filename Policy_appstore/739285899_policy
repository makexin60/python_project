Big Cartel, LLC (“Big Cartel”, “we” or “us”) provides software programs and services to independent merchants to allow them to host online storefronts and market to their customers (collectively, “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains how Big Cartel collects, uses, and discloses information from merchants when they visit our websites, register for the Services, or otherwise interact with us.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
This privacy policy applies to the data we collect from and about individuals who set up accounts with us, whom we refer to as “merchants,” as well as individuals who visit our website or communicate with us only. Please note that all online stores hosted or supported by Big Cartel, including those linked from Bigcartel.com, are independently operated by the merchants providing them. Big Cartel does not own or operate any merchant stores and is not responsible for the privacy practices of its merchants. If you visit any storefronts provided by Big Cartel merchants, we encourage you to review and become familiar with their privacy policies and to direct any questions or concerns you have about their data practices to the merchant you are visiting.

Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose
We disclose your personal information to third parties for business purposes. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
We share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:
Service providers, which we refer to as “vendors, consultants and other service providers” in our general privacy notice, above.
In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business purposes:
Category A: Identifiers.
Category B: California Customer Records personal information categories.
Category D: Commercial information.
Sales of Personal Information
In the preceding 12 months, we have not sold consumers’ personal information.
Your California Rights
The CCPA provides California consumers with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Requests to Access to Specific Information
You have the right to request that we disclose information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see below), we will disclose to you:
The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.
If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
Sales (if any) along with the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
Disclosures for a business purpose along with the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion Requests
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see below), we will delete (and direct any of our service providers that hold your data on our behalf to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers as permitted by law.
Right to Opt-out of Sales of Personal Information
CCPA provides California consumers with the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. This right does not apply to our use of personal information because we do not sell personal information and have not sold personal information in the past 12 months.
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request to us via email at
support@bigcartel.com
.
Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal information. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
We endeavor to respond to requests within 30 days of its receipt, but we are allowed by law to take up to 45 days to respond. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Verification
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
Although we are permitted under CCPA to offer certain financial incentives that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels, we do not presently do so.
