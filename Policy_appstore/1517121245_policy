Introduction
Banking is personal and it involves data about you. Nearly everything you do with us or on our website or app will involve the collection, creation, use, or sharing of data. Data about you helps us provide you with the best customer experience, understand you better and anticipate your needs. This is true whether it’s data you give us, that we collect through your use of our services, receive from others, or create through data analytics and more. It also helps us secure your accounts, improve our app and product offerings, deliver relevant marketing and advertising, and meet our legal obligations.
Our objective with this policy is to explain how and why we collect, create, use, share, store, and delete data. We’ll also outline the controls we offer to help you take advantage of the important rights you have with regards to your data, including privacy settings, notifications, marketing elections, website cookies management, and customer support.
About this Policy
This policy is provided by J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (25 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5JP, UK) as a so-called data controller under the UK Data Protection Act. This policy applies to all of our consumer banking and related services (referred to as the “Chase Services”). The terms that cover your account and other products and actual use of the Chase Services can be found within our app.
Over time, we’ll improve our Chase Services. We also expect to develop new ones. If this materially changes how we collect, create, use, share, store, and delete your data, we’ll update this policy. If you ever have questions or concerns, please get in touch.

Personal Data We Collect and Create
These are the types of data we collect, create, use, and share:
Personal Details and Identifiers
Your full name, home address, email address, phone number, social media profile details and information that is used to verify your identity. This can be photo ID, passport number, national insurance number, driving license number, and nationality.
Authentication Data
The data used to access the Chase Services. It includes your PIN number(s), password(s), security questions and answers. It also includes your unique account and user profile identifiers and biometric data used for identity verification.
Financial Information
Information used to assess your financial situation, and whether you’re suitable to receive financial credit. This includes your income, residential status, employment information, credit profile data, credit rating, and publicly available information (such as County Court Judgements or bankruptcy).
Account Information
Details relating to any account that you hold with us. This includes your account number, sort code, cards, account balance, unique identifiers, alerts, language settings, statement preferences, contact preferences, and overdraft limit.
Transaction History
Events like payments made and received (including those via third parties such as Apple Pay, Google Pay or PayPal), credits/debits, payees and payors, interest calculation and payments, and standing orders.
Health and Disability Data
Data that you may provide to us relating to a disability or health issue(s) which is relevant to your use of Chase Services. We will use the health data you provide to us to support your use of Chase services where needed. This might include the accessibility of our website or app, or a change in your health status that impacts your use of Chase Services.
Communications Data
Records and results of any communications between you and us. This includes by email, telephone, in-app chat, social media, and letter. This might include open rates and dates/times, whether it was forwarded, and your interaction with the communication.
Device and Technical Data
Data such as unique device identifiers, IP addresses, device type and model, as well as operating system and version. This might also include network connection type, browser type, advertising ID and non-precise location data. We might infer that from other data such as IP address.
Biometric Data
We create temporary facial recognition templates when we match your selfie to your photo ID as part of onboarding or when you reset your pin, unlock your account, or change your device. We also use behavioural biometric data, such as typing patterns and movement data.
Location Data
Your postcode, IP address and location data from your payment transactions. This might include location data from your device if you allow location sharing in the app.
Usage Data
Data generated from your website or in-app activity, such as what screens or product features you use and how long you spend using features within the app or on our site.
Cookies
We collect information from your device, or store information on your device, in the form of cookies. We use this information to:
help maintain the security of the Chase Services
help ensure that our website and app communicate correctly with our other services
remember your choices and settings
collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes – to help us understand how users use our services and help us improve them
Our Cookie Notice is available on our website and in our app.
Your Feedback or Opinions
If you choose to take part in our research initiatives, we’ll analyse your views and feedback to create insights that help us understand what people think about our brand. This will also help shape changes to our Chase Services and marketing campaigns.
Automated Decisions
Identity Verification
We use automated processes to check your identity. This can be when you’re onboarding as a new customer, unlocking your account, resetting your PIN, or changing your device.
To check it’s really you, we use facial recognition technology. This technology checks that the person in a selfie and an accepted photo ID are actually the same person. The faces in both photos are compared by creating a mathematical template based on measurement of the various points on your face – such as your chin, nose, and eyes.
The templates created through this matching process are temporary and not accessible to us. The templates are created by a vendor on our behalf, and deleted shortly after we have confirmed you are the same person in both photos. When this process does not create a match, it will be reviewed by an agent. We do not store your details for any other purpose, and our vendors don’t either.
Onboarding Fraud
When you apply for new Chase Services, we screen your personal details against fraud and credit reference databases. The results could prevent you from using the requested Chase Service.
Transaction Fraud
We also use automated decision making to help ensure transactions made on your account are correct and free from fraud. Your transactions (payments to and from your account) will be assessed to identify any unusual payments. Unusual payments include payments you would not normally make or haven’t yet made on our systems. We may stop or decline a payment that is likely to be fraudulent.
Credit and Affordability Assessments
If you apply for a credit product, we may use automated decisions through our Credit Decision Engine in order to assess if the product is suitable and appropriate for you.
To determine your eligibility, we look at the information you provided as part of your credit application. This includes data from Credit Reference Agencies, such as your credit history, which will show us if you have kept up with repayments or if you have any county court judgements or bankruptcies on your credit file. We combine this with other financial information we hold about you, such as your Chase current account data, to make the following automated decisions:
To assess if the product we have built is suitable to you
To make fair and informed decisions about how to lend responsibly
To determine if we can offer credit to you and how much
Examples of automated decisions may include:
Automatically calculating credit limit
To ensure we don't send marketing communications to you about our credit products where it is not relevant
To help us determine our overall credit risk as a bank and work out strategies for our products in a way that does not adversely affect you.
Our Credit Decision Engine is an automated system that uses various rules and scoring methods. These rules and scoring methods are regularly tested to ensure they remain consistent, effective, fair, and unbiased. You have rights in relation to automated decision making, including a right to appeal if your application is declined. If we reject your application, we will inform you of the outcome and the main reason. You can get in touch with us via our Customer Support for your application to be reviewed.
Sometimes, and when you’ve got a marker for financial difficulty or a Notice of Correction on your credit file, we’ll carry out a manual review so that we can get a better picture of your finances and make a decision about your application.
You can ask for information about any automated decision making that has a legal or similarly significant effect on you. We’ll explain the logic involved, how we use the decision and any potential consequences. You can also object, give us extra information or ask us to review a decision. In certain circumstances, you also have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.

‘Your ID’ is an additional feature in the Chase app. If you opt into ‘Your ID’, we’ll set it up using some of the data you’ve already given us.
When you joined Chase, you used either your passport or driver’s licence as proof of ID. ‘Your ID’ stores and presents a digital copy of the identity document you used, and related identity document data, in the Chase app – so you can access it, share it, or use it to complete forms.
You can opt into ‘Your ID’ from the Chase app. If you do so, we’ll automatically set it up using the following data from your passport or driver’s licence:
Identification document reference number
‘Your ID’ identifier
Personal details
Issue date, expiry date and document number
Date of birth

When you check your credit information in the Chase app, you’re making a ’Data Subject Access Request’ to TransUnion. This allows TransUnion to share your updated credit information with us at enrolment and on an on-going basis.
Each time you do this, a soft search is recorded on your credit report. A soft search does not impact your credit rating, or your ability to get credit.
Why we need to use your data

We share some of your data with fraud prevention agencies in line with our Privacy Policy. If your account is involved in fraud, we may refuse or stop providing you with certain services. Any record of fraud or money laundering risks on your account may mean you’re refused other services, such as mortgages and loans, and impact future employment.
You can find more information about your data protection rights and how fraud prevention agencies use your data on the Cifas website.
Credit Reference Agencies
This section explains how we work with Credit Reference Agencies if you hold a current account with us or if you apply for a credit product.
We run a check against the Credit Reference Agencies database when you open a current account with us and on a regular basis for the duration of your relationship with us to make sure your account is not involved in fraud. These are soft checks that do not leave a footprint on your credit file or impact your credit score.
We share details of your Chase current account with Credit Reference Agencies on a periodic basis. This will include details of funds going into the account, and the account balance. The Credit Reference Agencies may share this information with other organisations that wish to check your financial status to help them build a more complete picture of your finances.
If you apply for a credit product with us, we will carry out credit and identity checks with Credit Reference Agencies. When CRAs receive a request from us as part of your credit application, they will note it on your credit file, and this will be visible to other lenders. This is called a credit search. This information will be used by lenders to work out how much they can lend to you and how much you can afford to repay. If you apply for a product with someone else, your records will be linked by the CRAs. These links will stay on your credit file and will be visible to all lenders you apply to.
When you use our credit products, we also conduct periodic searches with CRAs to manage your account. To do this, we supply your personal information from your credit application to CRAs and they give us details about you. This includes information about your financial situation and financial standing. We will share details about your repayments, outstanding debts, and transaction records. We will also use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, manage your credit card and recover debts.
If you have applied for our credit card, we will use the information from CRAs to:
Carry out credit checks
Assess if we can offer you credit and how much
Assess whether you are able to make repayments
Trace and recover debts

From time to time, we may ask you to confirm the accuracy of your data.
Data Minimization
We take reasonable steps designed to ensure that your data that we process are limited to the data reasonably required in connection with the purposes set out in this notice.
Data Retention
We will retain your data in line with our data retention policy and for the minimum period required. The duration of the retention period is determined by a number of criteria including the nature of our relationship with you, UK law, the type of data and the Chase Services that the data relates to.
Once we no longer need to retain your data in a form that identifies you, we will permanently delete or destroy it, archive, and secure it so that it is beyond practical use; or anonymize it.
Updates to this Policy
We will update this Policy from time to time for example when we change the data we collect or the ways in which we process it.

TransUnion Bureau Privacy Notice
Version: 1.13
Date adopted: 17 July 2024
This privacy notice explains how we use and share personal data in connection with our credit risk and affordability assessments, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering checks, verification, debt tracing services and some of our related services. It also describes your data protection rights, including a right to object to some of the processing which TransUnion carries out. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in
section 9
below.
In Brief
At TransUnion, we provide data and data-related services to clients such as banks, credit providers, insurance companies, gambling companies, utility companies, retail companies and others for the purposes set out above (and in more detail at
section 2
below).
Some of our services involve processing data that is highly confidential such as your bank account, credit card or salary details. More information about the data we use can be found in
section 3
.
In providing our services to clients, we may use third party service providers to assist us (a summary of the key providers can be found in the table at
section 6
).
Some of these services involve checking your device information (from your mobile telephone, tablet or laptop for example), which we use to confirm your identity and/or to protect you from becoming a victim of fraud.
We may need to send your details to other countries as part of our services, occasionally outside of the European Union – details are provided at
section 7
.
You have the right to object to our use of your personal data. Please see

About us
We are TransUnion International UK Limited, which is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 03961870. Our trading address and registered office is at One Park Lane, Leeds, West Yorkshire LS3 1EP.
We are part of TransUnion Information Group (TU UK), which has its headquarters at the above address. Some of the members of TU UK are listed in

WHAT DO WE USE PERSONAL DATA FOR?
This section explains the purposes for which we use personal data about you. More detail about the types of personal data that we might use for these purposes can be found in
section 3
below.
Providing services to the organisation you may be dealing with
We use your personal data to provide services to the organisation you may be dealing with. These services might include, for example, credit risk assessment, affordability assessment for credit and non-credit purposes, customer management, vulnerability management, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering checks, verification services, tenant vetting, staff vetting and tracing for debt collection purposes. We may also use your personal data to provide such services in relation to you in a specific role: for example, where you are acting as guarantor in relation to a personal loan to another individual, or as a director or business owner where the relevant business is applying for a commercial loan.
Examples: credit risk assessment, customer management, identity verification, anti-fraud, tenant vetting, debt tracing
If you have applied for credit from one of our clients, they will send your data to us so that we can find you in our databases and return information about your credit history. They will use that information in order to assess your creditworthiness and decide whether you will be able to repay them.
If you have been given credit by one of our clients, we may be asked to monitor your credit files and send our client an alert if, for example, you receive a court judgment or become insolvent, or where there is a significant deterioration in your repayment behaviour.
If you are registered as having a vulnerability, we may be asked to provide this information to our clients to support credit risk assessments, customer management and overall customer experience purposes, so that they are aware of the presence of a vulnerability and can take appropriate steps in customer management.
If you need to prove your identity to an organisation, they may check the details you provide against the information on our databases or carry out ID document verification and facial biometrics in order to help confirm that you are who you say you are.
If you fill in a form on one of our clients’ websites as part of an onboarding process, we may collect behavioural information about your interactions with such form to alert our clients to potentially fraudulent activity.
When you have dealings with an organisation, for example a bank, they may submit your telephone number, email address, internet protocol (IP) address, bank account and card numbers to us so we can alert them to the possibility of a stolen identity or where there have been past fraud indicators associated with those details.
When you apply for a tenancy, the landlord or letting agent might check some aspects of your financial history (such as any CCJs or bankruptcies) to help them decide whether you would be a suitable tenant and are likely to pay the rent.
If you owe money to one of our clients and have moved without telling them, they may use our services in order to find your new address and other contact details so that they can contact you to arrange repayment.
When you apply for credit (or if you have existing credit), affordability checks using your data can help our clients understand whether you are likely to be able to afford the repayments. Affordability checks can also help our clients assess your eligibility for non-credit products. These checks  help our clients identify individuals who may be financially over-committed and can help prevent  over-indebtedness.
Examples: affordability assessment
Utility companies may perform affordability checks (either at an individual or a household level) to help them understand whether individuals or households applying for financial assistance with bills and/or other payments meet the eligibility criteria to receive it. This helps to ensure that financial assistance is most appropriately directed at financially vulnerable individuals and households.
Gaming organisations may use affordability checks to help identify individuals at risk of gambling-related harm. Our retail clients may use affordability checks to assess the risk that you might not be able to afford non-credit commitments or potential costs related to a product or service. This may help them decide whether they want to offer a particular product or service to you.
Other examples of affordability checks include: an automobile subscription service that may want to assess the likelihood of whether you could afford additional liabilities; or an online marketplace that may want to identify individuals or businesses at risk of not being able to afford to fulfil orders.
We may also process your personal data after services have been provided to our clients if, for example, we need to investigate any issues around the data that has been sent to us, stored by us or if we need to restore our systems in the event of a data loss incident.
More information about how we (and other credit reference agencies) use personal data in these kinds of service can be found in the
Credit Reference Agency Information Notice
.
Providing services to our other clients
We use personal data to provide services to organisations other than the one you are directly dealing with.
Example: fraud alerts
If we receive a large number of identity verification checks against a particular person in a short space of time, this may be an indicator that someone is attempting to commit identity theft or another form of fraud. When this happens, we use that indicator to provide real time fraud alerts to clients who have subscribed to that service.
If you have provided your details to an organisation in order to confirm your identity, we may retain those details and link them to other details we hold about you so that if a fraudster attempts to use some of your details to apply for credit with a different organisation, we can raise a potential fraud alert with that organisation.
We may also provide personal data to public sector bodies (for example police, local and central government) to assist them in carrying out their public duties including: the investigation, prevention and detection of crime and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders; missing persons investigations; the assessment and collection of taxes and other statutory payments including the detection of fraudulent benefit claims; the protection of the public purse; national security and the defence of the realm. Data may include the full electoral register, but only where those public sector bodies are entitled to access that data themselves (for specific, limited purposes) under the relevant legislation.
More information about how we (and other credit reference agencies) use personal data in these kinds of service can be found in the
Credit Reference Agency Information Notice
.
Profiling, statistical analysis and anonymisation
We use, and allow our clients to use, information to carry out profiling of consumers through statistical analysis. This includes the creation, validation and use of scorecards, models, and attributes in connection with the assessment of risks relating to credit, fraud, affordability and debt collection. It is also used in verifying identities, to monitor and predict market trends and to enable clients to refine lending and fraud strategies, and loss forecasting.
This helps us to determine the likelihood that a consumer with certain characteristics will act in a way that will produce certain outcomes; for example, to repay credit, to be able to afford credit, to claim on an insurance policy, to commit fraud, to respond to certain collection strategies or to become insolvent.
Example: fraud models
When you are looking to set up a new account or use new services (for example, signing up to a new credit card, setting up a new online retail account, or renting a new property), our clients may seek to verify your identity to ensure they are dealing with you and not a fraudster. Our modelled data involves mapping your personal information (such as email address, mobile number and bank details) to produce a score that can help predict the likelihood that your information is being used fraudulently and/or that you have been a victim of fraud.
We may also convert your personal data into statistical or aggregated form so that you are not identified or identifiable (thereby creating anonymised data). Anonymised data is not personal data and we may use such data to carry out research and analysis, including to produce statistical research and reports or for any other purposes.
Product or systems development and testing
We sometimes use personal data for demonstrating, developing, improving, monitoring, maintaining and testing our products and systems. This includes making sure that our security measures are working properly. Where possible, we will anonymise, pseudonymise or aggregate the data before doing this.
Consumer queries; legal and regulatory purposes
We may use your personal data for legal and regulatory purposes. For example, this might include responding to complaints or enquiries from you or a regulator about how we have used your personal data.
Examples: legal and regulatory purposes
If you object to us processing your personal data, we will need to use your personal data to assess your request.
If you make a complaint about us to our regulators, they will normally ask us to investigate your case. This will involve accessing your personal data in the course of that investigation.
Similarly, if you start court proceedings against us, we will normally need to review how we have used your personal data in order to defend ourselves against your claim.
3.
WHAT KINDS OF PERSONAL DATA DO WE USE, AND WHERE DO WE GET IT FROM?
When a client uses our services, they will typically send us information such as:
Identifiers (including your name, date of birth, and current and previous addresses). This helps us to match your information to the other information we hold in our databases.
Other information specific to you, for example your telephone number, email address, internet protocol (IP) address, bank account or credit card number.
Information collected from your device(s), such as your device details, location details or details regarding transactions you undertake.
Information collected from you with your consent, such as copies of government-issued ID documents and selfie images. We may derive biometric representations of your facial images from such documents for the purpose of identity verification and authentication.
The purpose for which they are requesting information about you.
Other relevant details such as the nature of your credit application.
When we receive that information, we match it against the other information that we hold (or obtain from third parties) in order to find and return additional information about you. Depending on the service we are providing, this can include information such as your credit history, credit score, any court judgments or insolvency-related events, property ownership data, fraud indicators, financial transaction information provided via open banking, and additional contact details or address history. It can also include similar kinds of information about people who are financially associated with you.
Some of the information we hold about you may include name and address information from the electoral register (or the electoral roll). There are two versions of this. One is known as the open register (or the edited electoral roll) and can be used for a variety of purposes including marketing, tracing (including online directories used to find friends and family), asset reunification and identity verification. The other is the full register which we can only use for limited purposes, including crime prevention. We use and share this data in accordance with The Representation of the People (England and Wales) regulations 2001 (as amended) and equivalent legislation in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
More information about the kinds of personal data we hold, and where we get it from, can be found in the
Credit Reference Agency Information Notice
.
4.
HOW LONG IS THE PERSONAL DATA KEPT FOR?
When we receive personal data from a client in order to provide services to them, we will keep a copy of that data for up to fifteen months in order to investigate any data supply or data load issues, restore our systems in the event of a data loss incident, and in order to investigate and respond to any complaints, claims and enquiries that we may receive from consumers, clients or regulators.
We may keep data that has been provided to us for identify verification purposes for up to six years and three months in order to help stop fraudsters – see examples under “Fraud Alerts” in
section 2
above.
Information about how long we keep data in our capacity as a credit reference agency is available in the
Credit Reference Agency Information Notice
.
5.
WHAT IS OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR HANDLING PERSONAL DATA?
This section explains the basis on which we process your personal data.
Legitimate interests
The UK’s data protection law allows the use of your personal data where necessary for legitimate purposes provided that this is not outweighed by the impact it has on you. The law calls this the
“legitimate interests”
condition for processing personal data.
The legitimate interests we are typically pursuing when providing services to our clients are:
Interest
Explanation
Promoting responsible lending and helping to prevent over-indebtedness.
Responsible lending means that lenders only sell products that are affordable and suitable for the borrowers’ circumstances. We help ensure this by sharing personal data about potential borrowers, their financial associates where applicable, and their financial history. We also help to protect consumers by preventing over-indebtedness in other areas, such as online gambling. A comprehensive range of measures exists in the UK to underpin the balance so that the legitimate interests are not outweighed by the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Further explanation about this balance is set out below.
Helping prevent and detect crime and fraud; anti-money laundering; and identity verification
We provide identity, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering services to help clients meet legal and regulatory obligations, and to the benefit of individuals to support identity verification and support of the detection and prevention of fraud and money-laundering.
Supporting tracing and collections
We provide services that support tracing and collections where there is a legitimate interest in the client conducting activity to find its customer and to recover the debt, or to reunite, or confirm an asset is connected with, the right person. We also assist debt collection agencies in predicting, analysing and evaluating the costs of debt recovery to enable them to determine the value of a debt book.
Complying with and supporting compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
We have to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements, and our services also help other organisations comply with their own legal and regulatory obligations. For example, many kinds of financial services are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority, who impose obligations to check that financial products are suitable for the people they are being sold to. We provide data to help with those checks. We also use the data to assist our gambling clients to comply with obligations imposed on them by relevant legislation and the Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) published by the Gambling Commission.
Our use of personal data is subject to an extensive framework of safeguards that help make sure that your rights are protected. These include the information you are given about how your personal data will be used and how you can exercise your rights to obtain your personal data, have it corrected or restricted, object to it being processed, and complain if you are dissatisfied. These safeguards help sustain a fair and appropriate balance so that our activities do not compromise your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms.
Necessity for compliance with a legal obligation
We sometimes need to use your personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation that we are under. For example, if you submit a request to us for a copy of your personal data, either directly or through a third party that you have authorised to act on your behalf, we will normally be legally required to provide that personal data. See
section 9
below for details of what requests you can make and how to make them.
6.
WHO DO WE SHARE THE PERSONAL DATA WITH?
Our clients and resale partners
We share personal data with our clients for the purposes described in
section 2
above. Our clients will each have their own privacy notices which will provide more information about how they (specifically) use the data we supply.

Similarly, your financial associates are also entitled to obtain copies of the personal data that we hold about them.
Other credit reference agency data sharing activities
For a broader description of how we share data in our capacity as a credit reference agency, please refer to the
Credit Reference Agency Information Notice
.
Business transfers
If we sell our business to a third party, or go through a corporate reorganisation, we will transfer personal data to the company that acquires the business.
Regulators and law enforcement
Personal data may be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials if required for the purposes above, if required by law, or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws. For example, we may sometimes need to pass personal data to a regulator such as the Information Commissioner’s Office or the Financial Conduct Authority.
Sharing of anonymised data with third parties
We may share anonymised information with other third parties, but only where the information cannot realistically be identified as relating to you.
7.
WHERE IS THE PERSONAL DATA STORED AND SENT?
Within Europe
We are based in the United Kingdom and will access and use your information from here. However, we also have operations elsewhere in Europe and personal data may be accessed from there too. In these cases, the use of the information in those locations is protected by European data protection standards.
We may also send personal data to some of our service providers or clients who have operations within the European Union.
Elsewhere
We also send information elsewhere in the world. For example:
We make use of TransUnion group service companies (referred to as Global Capability Centres, or GCCs), located in India, South Africa, Costa Rica and the United States. See
section 6
for more details.
When one of our other overseas group companies or branch offices based overseas needs to use the information in accordance with this notice. This may include an overseas group company providing services to their clients for the purposes set out in
section 2
above.
Where we use cloud-based technology or a data centre or backup facility overseas. People in other countries may also need to access that database for purposes such as technical support or system development and testing.
Where our service providers have operations outside the European Union (see the table at
section 6
above).
While the UK and countries within the European Union all ensure a high standard of data protection law, some parts of the world may not provide the same level of legal protection in relation to personal data. As a result, when we do send personal data overseas, we will make sure that suitable safeguards are in place to protect the information when required. For example, these safeguards might include:
Putting in place a contract with the recipient containing terms which have been approved by the authorities as providing a suitable level of protection.
Sending the information to an organisation which is a member of a scheme which has been approved by the authorities as providing a suitable level of protection. One example is the Data Privacy Framework that has been agreed between the UK, European and US authorities.
Encrypting the information (‘scrambling’ or converting it into code which makes it incomprehensible to anyone not authorised to view it) in order to add an additional layer of protection.
If your information has been sent overseas like this, you can obtain further information about the safeguards used by contacting us using the details set out in
section 1
above.
8.
IS THE PERSONAL DATA USED TO MAKE AUTOMATED DECISIONS ABOUT YOU OR TO PROFILE YOU?
Decisions
In almost all cases, we do not use your personal data to make automated decisions about you or to profile you.
We provide data and analytics that help our clients make decisions about lending and other matters (such as preventing fraud or protecting consumers), but our clients’ own data, knowledge, processes and practices will also generally play a significant role in their decisions – and those decisions will always be for them to make.
For example, when we sell our services to credit or loan providers, we do not decide whether or not you should be granted credit or a loan – this is for the lender to decide. Similarly, where we provide information to gambling companies, we do this to help them protect vulnerable consumers or those at risk of becoming overindebted. However, they will ultimately decide how to act upon that information, taking into account their legal and regulatory obligations.
Where our resale partners ask us for a copy of your credit information, we need to verify your identity in order to ensure that your credit information is not given out to fraudsters. This is an automated process and it could result in you being declined access to the services provided by that resale partner if we cannot verify your identity.
Scores and ratings
We use the data we hold to produce credit, risk, fraud, identity, affordability, screening, collection and insolvency scores and credit ratings.
Example: credit scores
If you apply to a bank for a loan, the bank will need to assess your creditworthiness. It will use the information you provide on your form, together with other information it already holds about you (such as how you have managed your previous accounts with that bank), and information obtained from third parties such as credit reference agencies.
We may use the credit reference data we hold to generate a credit score which provides an indication of your creditworthiness. The bank may use the credit score as part of its decision-making. Factors that may affect your credit score include:
How long you have lived at your address.
The number and type of credit agreements you have, and how you use those credit products.
Whether you have been late making payments.
Whether you have had any court judgments made against you.
Whether you have been bankrupt or have had an IVA or other form of debt-related arrangement.
The number of credit-related searches that organisations have made against your credit file, for example when you apply for a loan or credit card, or when a debt collection agency requests information about you.
9.
WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?
You have several different rights in relation to the personal data that we hold about you. These are briefly described below. To enquire about exercising these rights, please use our
Consumer Enquiries
page.
If you are looking for information about your rights in relation to the personal data we hold in our capacity as a credit reference agency, please refer to the
Credit Reference Agency Information Notice
.
Access:
You have a right to find out what personal data we hold about you, and certain other information such as how we are using it. (If you want to see your credit report online, please visit
https://www.transunion.co.uk/consumer-solutions/your-credit-report
.)
Withdrawal of consent:
When we rely on your consent to use your data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. However, we do not rely on consent for the activities described in this privacy notice.
Objection to direct marketing:
You have the right to object to us using your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including any profiling or similar activities which are performed as a precursor to direct marketing. The activities described in this privacy notice do not include the use of personal data for direct marketing purposes but you have the right to object to us doing so in the future.
Rectification:
If the information that we hold about you is inaccurate or out of date, you have a right to ask us to correct it.
Objection to processing based on legitimate interests:
Where we rely on the legitimate interests legal basis for using your personal data (see
section 5
above), you can object to that use of the data. We will then review and decide the extent to which we can continue to use the data in light of your particular circumstances.
Erasure:
In certain circumstances you can ask us to delete your personal data from our systems. However, this usually won’t apply to all of your data because we might have good reason for needing to keep some of it.
Restriction:
In some circumstances you can ask us to restrict the ways in which we use your personal data.
Portability:
In some circumstances you have the right to receive some limited kinds of information in a portable format. However, this typically does not apply to the data to which this privacy notice applies.
