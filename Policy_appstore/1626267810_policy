Our privacy policy explains exactly what steps we take to protect your privacy as a SEGA Europe customer. You can read the full policy
here
, but on this page we wanted to simplify the legal text and make it easy for everyone to understand.
SEGA Europe and its studios take your privacy and security very seriously. When you interact with SEGA products and services, we collect information about you which helps us to understand you and our customers better. That said, protecting the privacy of our youngest fans is very important to us, and for that reason, we wouldn’t knowingly collect or keep the personal data of any users under the age of 13.
If you are a football professional (a footballer, manager, referee, coach or staff member) as well as a consumer and player of the Products, you should also read the
Football Manager Privacy Policy for Professionals
which explains in more detail how SEGA uses your personal data in the context of the Football Manager video game.
Here are the main areas in which we will collect personal data about you:
When you sign up to access one of our products, you leave your registration information.
When you buy a SEGA product through the SEGA store, you leave us your billing information.
When you play one of our mobile or PC games on your personal devices, you leave us device information
When you take part in SEGA surveys or research, your questions and opinions about our products are logged
There are many other ways that you might leave us your personal data, including information you’ve made publicly available on social media, competitions you enter hosted by SEGA and more. You can find more information
here
.
If at any point you want us to stop using your personal data and delete the information that we hold about you, you can make a
support request
, selecting ‘DATA REQUESTS’ from the drop down menu. We’ll then take care of your request within 30 days.  Just be aware that some of our products need a small amount of your personal data for you to be able to access them. For example, a product that asks for login details from you at registration might not be accessible if you ask for your personal data to be removed.
How does SEGA Europe use your personal data?
We’ll use your personal data for a number of different reasons, all of them to help you have a better experience with our products.
Registration information means you have a profile to access our products which means we can identify you when you sign in. Once signed in, you can change your preferences and give us your views on our products.
If you’ve allowed us to, we will sometimes send you marketing emails or show you in-game ads to let you know about new products or events that you might be interested in or have said you’re interested in. You’re welcome to change your communication preferences at any time to stop getting these though.
Your billing information helps us to check that you’ve bought one of our products and process any refunds if you’re not happy with your purchase.
The device information we collect from you when you use one of our products helps us to provide you with the best possible experience, fix errors and ultimately improve our products, while also helping us to keep our gaming spaces safe, within the law and inclusive for all.
Data you share with us when interacting with us on social media helps us to understand what people think about our products. The data you leave when entering competitions means if you’re lucky enough to win, we can get your prizes safely delivered to you!
Does SEGA ever share your personal data with other companies?
The short answer to this is: sometimes! But you have the power to tell us how and where you are comfortable for your data to be shared. Here are some examples of where your data may be shared.
Other companies within the SEGA group. This might be one of our studios like Creative Assembly and it’s usually because you’ve stated an interest in certain products and services when you’ve registered with one of our products.
Third parties like Valve, who own the Steam platform. Other platform holders like Epic, Apple, Google Play, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo and Microsoft Xbox may also receive your personal data when you use our products on their platforms. We call this group of companies ‘Platform Operators’.
We use marketing services such as Mailchimp, which allow us to talk to lots of customer at exactly the same time, so we would share your data there if you have allowed us to in your communication preferences. Remember! You can change your communication preferences or simply unsubscribe at any time if you don’t want to receive these emails.
We would also share your data if we were asked to by a law enforcement agency. This is a pretty rare occurrence though but highlights our commitment to keeping our players safe.
What are your rights when it comes to your personal data?
Put simply, it is completely up to you how we use your personal data. We do require you to provide personal data to register or to sign in to make use of some of our products. For these products, it may not be possible to access them without leaving personal data. We will never share it anywhere if you tell us you don’t want us to do so.
If you ever want to check what personal data we hold for you or make changes to it, you can do so by submitting a
support request
and selecting ‘DATA REQUESTS’ from the drop down menu. If you prefer, you can contact us:

(A)    REGISTRATION INFORMATION
Your registration information enables us to provide you with access to our Products and to supply the Products, including when you attend an event or programme organised and/or administered by SEGA. This is necessary for the purpose of performing the contract we have with you or facilitating your attendance at one of our events or programmes. It helps us to authenticate your access to our Products, to contact you for your views and to notify you of important changes or updates to our Products or an event which you have registered to attend.
Where we have your consent and in accordance with your stated communication preferences, we may also contact you for marketing purposes to let you know by email, telephone, mobile or in-app messaging about our other products and services.
If you choose to sign-up for our Products using third party services such as your Facebook account, Facebook may share your personal data with us subject to Facebook's privacy policy and the privacy settings of your Facebook account.  This may also enable Facebook and us to link your activities with your personal registration information at their site, and may include notifying your friends about your activities whilst using our Products. If you sign-up via third party services you should visit the third party website and review their privacy policy and your registration profile or account to understand how your data is processed by them and to find out what your options are.
If you no longer want us to use your personal data in this way or generally change your mind about receiving marketing communications, you can unsubscribe at any time, either by using the unsubscribe option in the communication you receive or by changing your communication settings. By unsubscribing from marketing communications, you will be opted out of our e-mail/marketing tracking pixels. Please note that we will retain a record of the user information when you unsubscribe from our marketing information for the legitimate purpose of ensuring that we do not contact you further in this way, during the period of your objection, if relevant.
(B)    BILLING INFORMATION
This information will enable us to verify your purchases with third party stores and to contact you in order to assist with resolving any problems with your purchases and to process any refund payments that you may be due.
We will also use and analyse information on transactions on your account for our legitimate interests by data matching or statistical analysis so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business and to help us detect and prevent fraud, or other illegal activities, or acts prohibited by our terms of service or any policies applicable to our Products.
(C) TECHNICAL AND DEVICE INFORMATION
We analyse information about how you engage with our Products to understand how our Products are used and to provide you with an optimal gaming experience, such as by rolling out performance-optimising software updates for our Products.   We use anonymous data in order to analyse and produce statistics relating to the habits, usage patterns and demographics of users as a group or as individuals.  This allows us to deliver you personalised content, helps us understand the features of our Products that appeal to you and allows us to manage advertising, amongst other things.
When you interact with or visit our websites, we may automatically collect information about you such as the type of internet browser or mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to any of our Products and your IP address and your operating system, which are automatically recognised by our web server.
We use internet log files to monitor traffic on our Products, resolve technical problems and to detect and prevent fraud.  We use these technologies to provide us with information, such as when an email is opened, or to develop statistics on the effectiveness of advertising or marketing on our websites.

SEGA uses the information collected during surveys and user research sessions to help us to tailor and improve our Products.
SEGA may share data from user research sessions with certain third-party partners where there is a legitimate business requirement to do so. In such circumstances, your data will always be fully anonymised before it is shared.
(E) THIRD PARTY INFORMATION
We share information obtained from your use of our Products with third parties to provide you with an optimal experience, to facilitate use of our Products as advertised and to enable you to play our Products on various gaming platforms.

(i) sales data so that we can track the sale and performance of our Products; and
(ii) gameplay data related to your interactions with our Products, including player performance statistics, in-game actions, character options and other similar in-game data which helps us to improve certain aspects and features within our Products.
We may use analytics technologies to link your online activities (including across your devices) so that we can serve targeted ads.  Valve (the Platform Operator for the Steam digital download platform) may for example share pseudonymised Steam IDs with us to help optimise our offerings to you and to help us understand how you are using our Products. Again, if Valve shares this information with us it does so subject to its privacy policy, and the privacy settings of your Steam account.
We may also work with advertising networks that serve advertisements into our Products, or the websites and products of third parties. Some of those advertisements may be personalised to your interests based on your activity and technical information and/or use data contained within the cookies which are stored on your device, with your consent. Personalisation of your experience may be facilitated when our technology partners disclose data, such as your browsing patterns, geolocation, and device identifiers, and this information is matched with the browser and device you are using.
Certain Products are currently supported by third party advertising partners that serve advertisements (“
Third Party Advertisers
”), including behavioural, location or interest based advertising (“
Interest Based Advertising
”) within our Products. These Third Party Advertisers use technology to serve the advertisements and link to them directly into our Products.  They may automatically receive your device ID, IP address or geo-location data when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise the advertising content you see. See also our
Cookies Policy
.
We may also bring you advertising content in certain Products, which you would traditionally see in a live game environment, for example perimeter advertising in a football game. For example, our Football Manager PC/Mac Product is currently supported by Bidstack, a platform that enables Third Party Advertisers to dynamically serve in-game native billboard advertising within video games.
We may also provide functionality within our Products which enables you to upload gameplay footage to YouTube. If you choose to use this feature, we will receive and store an authentication token from Google so that the feature will operate properly.  The use of this functionality is governed by YouTube’s Terms of Service:
https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms
.  Further information about the protection of your privacy can be found in Google’s privacy policy:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
. You can also view and modify your permissions via Google’s security settings:
https://myaccount.google.com/permissions.
Certain Third Party Advertisers may collect (with your permission) precise location data, or street-level location information, about you (“
Precise Location Data
”). Your mobile device may allow you to opt out of the collection of Precise Location Data by the Third Party Advertiser in the Product through settings on your device. Please note that your mobile device will not share location information without your permission.
(F) INFORMATION FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ONLINE SOURCES
We will use and analyse this data for our legitimate interests so that we can collect information about how you use our Products, how you engage with our marketing campaigns and to gain an understanding of community sentiment about our Products.  We may use third party analytics providers who collect this data on our behalf.  Where possible, we will ensure that any personal data that is collected for these purposes is anonymised.
(G) INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR USE OF OUR PRODUCTS
This information enables us to track the performance of our Products, develop new Products and communicate with our Platform Operators and partners. It also enables us to better understand our users and improve our advertising, targeting and measurement systems. We will only provide tailored advertising where we have your consent. Any information we use to inform and enhance our business strategies is fully anonymised.
(H) COMPETITIONS
SEGA collects and processes this data for the purposes of running and monitoring the competition, as well as for carrying out publicity activities relating to the competition.
Your personal data will be retained by SEGA for the duration of the competition and for a period after this time as necessary to deliver the prizes (if applicable).
We may offer opportunities to receive certain services or benefits (including virtual or tangible items, competition entry, or monetary prizes when you sign up for communications, participate in surveys or research sessions, or when we are conducting similar incentive based activities, which may require the provision of your personal data for participation (“Incentive Activities”). Your participation in Incentive Activities is purely voluntary. When you participate in Incentive Activities, you agree to the terms of the applicable Incentive Activity and may revoke your participation depending on the nature of the Incentive Activities.
(I) SOCIAL MEDIA PLUG-INS
Once your data has been shared with the social media platform (acting as a joint controller of your data), your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the relevant platform. More information about their privacy practices can be found at the following links:
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/
https://x.com/en/privacy
(J) ANTI-CHEAT AND ANTI-HACKING TECHNOLOGIES
SEGA may utilise anti-cheat and/or anti-hacking technologies to help us to detect illegal or malicious activity and to take the appropriate actions if such activity is detected.
The anti-cheat/hacking technologies within your Product may require you to download certain data to your device. If you disable or otherwise tamper with these technologies, the Product may not operate properly and you will be in breach of the applicable end user license agreement.
(K) LIVEOPS SOFTWARE
If you play a Product that utilises LiveOps software, that third party software will collect certain personal data about you as required by that service. This personal data will be processed and stored in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy (as notified to you before your data is collected, most commonly when the Product first launches).
(L) USER ACQUISITION / ATTRIBUTION AND CORE / CUSTOM / LOOKALIKE AUDIENCES
We use various forms of marketing to acquire new users for our Products, working with a variety of third party partners to deliver our marketing campaigns and serve advertisements on external websites and social media platforms. As part of this, we may share certain data with our user acquisition and attribution partners.
If you have consented to this type of marketing, you will receive targeted ads when you use the internet or play our Products (our Custom Audience).  Other users of those platforms who share similar interests to you may also receive targeted ads about our Products (our Lookalike Audience). Other users may receive ads about our Products depending on their age, location, gender and language (our Core Audience).

3. When we share information
We may share the information we collect about you (subject to the necessary security, contractual and transfer safeguards).  These are some of the partners we may share your personal data with:
(a)    SEGA companies within the wider SEGA group;
(b)    Third party platform operators such as Valve who operate the Steam digital download platform, Epic, Apple, Google Play, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo, Microsoft Xbox, and other partners who carry out various activities and services to support our Products (collectively, the “Platform Operators”);
(c)    Marketing partners for marketing or promotions such as Mailchimp, based on your communication preferences;
(d)    New owners or re-organised entities and their advisors in the event of a business restructure, sale, purchase or joint venture affecting our business; and
(e)    Law enforcement agencies/authorities, when we are under a duty or are authorised by law for law enforcement purposes.
Your personal data may be transferred to other countries where SEGA or its service providers maintain operations. These countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to the country from where you access our Products, but we will ensure that we rely on appropriate safeguards.
Read further below for more details on when we share the information which we collect and/or receive from you.
In delivering our Products to you, we may share your personal data with:
Companies within the SEGA group (which means SEGA Entities which are our parent and affiliated companies, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates) who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy.
Third parties in order to undertake various activities or services on our behalf in supporting our Products. This includes payment processing providers facilitating credit and payment card transactions, website and application support and hosting providers for online videogame services and software downloads and providers for the delivery of promotional, digital advertising, co-marketing, or other communications, such as MailChimp.
If our business enters into a joint venture, purchases or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, or new business partners or owners or their advisors.
We may use the information that you provide if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation; or to enforce the relevant terms of service and any other agreement; or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations such as credit agencies, law enforcement or government bodies or the courts in connection with a criminal investigation, suspected illegal activity, fraud prevention and detection or in legal proceedings.
Personal data may be transferred to other countries where SEGA or its service providers maintain operations. These countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to the country from where you access our Products or, in the case of transfers subject to European law, may not be subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission (EC). An adequacy decision is a decision taken by the EC establishing that a third country provides a comparable level of protection of personal data to that in the EU, through its domestic law or its international commitments.
Where SEGA transfers personal data it will seek to take account of any applicable legal obligations relevant to personal data transfers.  In the case of transfers of personal data out of the European Economic Area,  it will, in the absence of an EC adequacy decision relevant to the destination country, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as the EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to personal data transfers between data controllers or between a data controller and a data processor.

Introduction
SEGA Europe Limited, its subsidiaries and affiliates including Sports Interactive Limited (“
SI
”) (together “
SEGA
”) are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal data. SI collects different types of information about you for inclusion in its database (“
Database
”) relating to the Football Manager series of games published on various formats, including mobile and console (together, the "
Products
") if you are a football professional including but not limited to a footballer, manager, referee, coach or staff member ("
Football Professional
").
If you are a Football Professional as well as a consumer and player of the Products, you should also read SEGA’s Privacy Policy which explains in more detail how SEGA uses your personal data in the context of the Products and other SEGA products:
https://www.sega.co.uk/Privacy
This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and protect your personal data when it is collected and compiled in the Database. It also sets out the options you have in relation to your data.
The data controller is responsible for collecting and using your personal data. To comply with data protection legislation, the data controller will be SI. See '
Your questions and how to contact us
' section of this privacy policy for more details.
We reserve the right to update this privacy policy from time to time by changing it as it applies to your inclusion within the Database and/or your use of any of the Products. The date of the current privacy policy is the Effective Date set out above.
1. Information we collect
The Database comprises data compiled from and using or representing real-life Football Professionals from around the world to simulate real-world football performance. The Database includes full names of the Football Professionals as well as characteristics, behaviour and likenesses as they relate to the Football Professional's career in the real world.
Specifically, SEGA collects some or all of the following personal data in respect of each Football Professional:
Given first name and surname.
Date of birth.
Age.
Nationality.
Ethnicity.
Head shot photograph.
Details about the Football Professional's club, which may include contract type and expiration date, team and game statistics.
Estimated gross salary, earnings per week and number of bonuses awarded.
Physical attributes, such as hair colour, height, weight and body type.
Medical history (limited to injuries or illnesses that prevent a player from playing football for a period of time) where the data is widely available to, and accessible by, the public, typically as a result of the Football Professionals themselves or their representatives making such data public.
Various technical, mental and physical attributes as they relate to a Football Professional’s ability and performance.
(together, the “
Data
”).
2. How we collect your information
The Data is compiled by SI’s scouting network and in-house research team (together, the “
Network
”).  The Network collects the Data in three ways: (i) through attendance at football matches where the performance of Football Professionals is observed and rated; (ii) through publicly available information such as newspapers, match programmes, match reporting websites, general football interest websites and TV programmes (including statements made by the Football Professionals themselves); and (iii) through SI’s relationships with various third parties such as football clubs, leagues and football associations.
3. How we use your information
Once the Data has been compiled by the Network and verified for accuracy purposes, SI’s in-house research team review the Data and data sources. Subjective sets of ratings which cover physical, mental and technical attributes of Football Professionals are built up over a period of weeks, months and years to provide a full profile. Once the Data has been verified and cross-referenced, it is then integrated within the Database to provide players of our Products with a rich and realistic football management experience. As part of this experience, we process all non-special category Data for our legitimate commercial interests. We process medical history data on the basis that such information is manifestly made public by the data subject and ethnicity related data for statistical purposes.
Additionally, Football Professionals are rated by the Network in more than 30 categories based on technical ability (for example: dribbling and corner-taking), mental ability (for example: aggression and decision-making) and physical ability (for example: balance and agility). These ratings are intended to reflect the Football Professional's ability, but SI and SEGA make no guarantee, warranty or representation as to the accuracy of such ratings at any time.
For the sake of completeness, as players of our Products progress through the game, certain data fields relating to Football Professionals may change due to the actions and choices of the players and by the application of probability and chance algorithms introduced into the game to facilitate realistic gameplay. If you would like any further information in relation to the artificial intelligence software that SI uses, please contact
dpo@sega.co.uk
.
4. When we share information
We may share your personal data with:
Consumers of our Products. The Database powers our Products and as such your personal data is shared with our customers when they access and use our Products.
Companies within the SEGA group (which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates) who act for us for the purposes set out in this privacy policy.
Third parties in order to undertake various activities or services on our behalf in supporting the Products. This includes sharing our Products with third party partners (such as Google, Nintendo and Microsoft) for the purposes of delivering our content to consumers of our Products on those platforms.
Select third party partners within the sporting world (such as football clubs and data analytics businesses) so that they can use the Database for scouting purposes and to improve team development, or to analyse and predict team and player performance.
We may also share your personal data in the following circumstances:
If our business enters into a joint venture, purchases or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, or new business partners or owners or their advisors.
We may use this information if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation; or to enforce the relevant terms of service and any other agreement; or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations such as credit agencies, law enforcement or government bodies or the courts in connection with a criminal investigation, suspected illegal activity, fraud prevention and detection or in legal proceedings.
Personal data may be transferred to other countries where SEGA or its service providers maintain operations. These countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to the country from where players access the Products or, in the case of transfers subject to European law, may not be subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission (EC).  An adequacy decision is a decision taken by the EC establishing that a third country provides a comparable level of protection of personal data to that in the EU, through its domestic law or its international commitments.
Where SEGA transfers personal data it will seek to take account of any applicable legal obligations relevant to personal data transfers.  In the case of transfers of personal data out of the European Economic Area,  it will, in the absence of an EC adequacy decision relevant to the destination country, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as the EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to personal data transfers between data controllers or between a data controller and a data processor  (see
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm
).
5. Security and data retention
The Database comprises data of Football Professionals for all current and historic versions of the Products, which includes each iteration of the Football Manager series of games.
We place great importance on the steps we take, including physical, technical and organisational measures, to protect your information and the Database from unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
Your personal data will be retained by us for the duration of the commercial lifetime of our Products and may be retained for a period after this time in order to ensure the ongoing accuracy of the data within the Database. The retention of this data also helps us to benchmark certain milestones and achievements within the game, including ‘most expensive transfer’ or ‘highest goal-scorer’ over a certain time period.
We will also retain your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and obligations, which may include retention necessary to meet our tax reporting requirements as well as time required to enforce the relevant terms of service, any game “sun-setting” requirements or to identify, issue or resolve legal proceedings.
We may retain a record of your stated objection to the processing of your personal data for the sole purpose of ensuring that we can continue to respect your wishes to not contact you further, during the term of your objection.
We will take appropriate steps to seek to destroy or permanently de-identify personal data at the point this information is no longer needed by us for our business or legal purposes.
For more information about exercising your rights with respect to our data processing activities, see details below about your choices and rights.
