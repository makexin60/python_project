Privacy Policy for the Scelta and Scelta Pro Apps
1. Introduction
Scelta and Scelta Pro are designed to help you track your weight and achieve your personal goals while prioritizing your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains which data is collected, how it is processed and stored, and how third-party services are used. Scelta is designed to minimize the collection of personally identifiable information.
2. Data Collection and Processing
a) Weight Data and Goals
•
Local Storage:
All weight entries, photos, notes and personal goals that you enter in Scelta are stored
exclusively locally on your device
. They are used solely to display your progress within the app.
•
Deletion:
Deleting Scelta from your device will remove all locally stored weight entries, photos, notes and goals.
b) Virtual Points, Coins, and Achievements
•
Earning Rewards:
By adhering to your personal weight goals (whether you aim to lose, gain, or maintain your weight), you can earn abstract “SP” points, coins, and achievements.
•
Game Center / Google Play Games Integration:
If you choose to enable the Game Center (iOS) or Google Play Games (Android) feature, your earned virtual rewards are visualized and shared through your respective account.
•
Privacy of Personal Data:
Only aggregated data (points, coins, and achievements) is shared with these services; your actual weight entries or detailed goal information are never transmitted or made public.
3. Data Storage and Synchronization
•
Local Data:
All data related to your weight entries, photos, notes, goals, and progress remains on your device.
•
Game Center / Google Play Games:
Virtual rewards and related information are stored and managed by Apple Game Center or Google Play Games, depending on your device. These platforms do not receive any detailed personal data from Scelta.
4. Use of the Apple Health App
•
Optional Integration:
Scelta can optionally read from and write to the Apple Health app if you grant the necessary permissions.
•
Data Access:
Once access is granted, Scelta can read all weight entries stored by the Apple Health app.
•
Data Deletion:
Scelta can only delete Health app entries that were created through Scelta itself. To remove entries created by other apps, please use the Apple Health app or the original app that generated those entries.
5. Third-Party Services
a) Payment Processing
•
RevenueCat:
Scelta uses RevenueCat for processing payments. In this context, a randomly generated user identifier is used to track subscription status and in-app purchases.
•
Data Sharing:
RevenueCat’s privacy policy ensures that information about the app’s data is not shared externally. For more details, please refer to the
RevenueCat Privacy Policy
.
b) Analytics and Diagnostics (Android Only)
•
Firebase Services:
On Android devices, Scelta employs Firebase services provided by Google Ireland Limited to derive behavioral analytics.
•
Google Analytics for Firebase:
This service collects data such as unique “Instance IDs” (with timestamps) and the device’s advertising ID to provide insights into app usage. Google Analytics retains ID-associated data for 60 days and aggregates other reporting data.
You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in your device settings (for Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Reset Ad ID).
•
Firebase Crashlytics:
Crashlytics records and analyzes error reports and crash data, including device type, operating system version, and error timestamps. This diagnostic data is used solely to improve the app’s stability and performance.
•
Personal Data:
In most cases, only aggregated and non-personally identifiable information is processed by Firebase.
6. Data Deletion and User Control
•
Local Data Control:
All weight entries, photos, notes, goals, and progress data stored locally in Scelta can be deleted by uninstalling the app or using your device’s data management tools.
•
Third-Party Data:
Data stored via third-party services (such as Apple Health, Game Center, or Google Play Games) is managed and deleted through those services. The developer does not have direct control over data maintained by these external providers. If you wish to delete or access data stored by these services, please use their respective settings or contact the provider directly.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Your continued use of Scelta and Scelta Pro is governed by the current version of this Privacy Policy. We recommend reviewing this page periodically to stay informed of any changes.
