Last updated: September 12, 2024
Our mission is to empower visual storytellers. When you use our services, you’re entrusting us with your information, and we understand this is a big responsibility. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and what choices you have. By using our website, mobile applications, or interacting with us otherwise, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions, you can always email us at
privacy@picsart.com
.
Information we collect
Categories and types of information you share with us or give us permission to obtain
When you create an account we collect the information you provide us through text fields, including contact and other identifying information such as your first and last name, email address, username, and password. We also require data about your location, which we approximate from your IP address or device settings. We use all of this to securely set up your account and provide our services to you.
You may also have the option to share demographic information about yourself, such as your gender, age, and preferred language, which we collect to make Picsart more relevant to you.
We also collect visual information through the images that you post to our services, including your profile photos.
With your permission (on download or within one of our apps), we may access and store your device's contact list to help you find your friends on Picsart, invite them to Picsart, or to share your content with them. If you connect your Facebook, Instagram, or other third-party accounts to Picsart, we use information from those accounts (like your user name, friends, or contacts) for the same purpose. You can choose to stop sharing that information with us at any time by going to Facebook, Instagram, or other third-party account and removing our access.
We may also collect information about others if you use Picsart to upload, share or distribute content that contains information about them, including their name, image, and contact information. With your prior explicit consent, we may also collect information about others from third party platforms such as social media sites, for example when you log in to Picsart using the login information of other social media sites.
If you create an account to use our services through Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, or similar services, with your permission, we collect information from those accounts (like your email and public profile information) to authenticate you within our services.
We also get technical information when you use Picsart
When you use a website or mobile application like ours, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically. These are the types of technical information we collect:
Log data
. Our servers passively keep an electronic record of your interactions with our services, which we call "log data". For example, when you visit our website, sign into our services, or browse content, we collect data about these interactions that includes where you navigate within our website and apps, your IP address, browser type and settings, the date and time of your visit, search terms, which elements of our site and services you use the most, device data, and cookie data. We use log data to operate our services, maintain security, ensure reliable performance, and improve your experience on Picsart.
Cookie data
. We use "cookies" and similar technologies to collect log data and operate our services. You can learn more about how we use cookies in "
cookies
" below.
Device data
. We collect and combine data about the devices you use to access Picsart, and data about your device usage and activity.
Metadata of visual information
. We collect the metadata linked to your content. For example, your images may be accompanied by additional content like comments or a geotag. This makes your content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using others' APIs, then the latitude and longitude coordinates may be stored with the photo and may be searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if you make your photo publicly viewable.
TrueDepth API
. If you have an Apple iOS device and use the camera function with our services, we may automatically collect data about the spatial positioning of a person’s head or face within an image frame using Apple’s TrueDepth API. We use this data in real time so you can apply effects and use other editing tools. None of the data collected via TrueDepth API ever leaves your device, it isn’t persistently stored on your device, and it isn’t shared with third parties.
How we use the information we collect, and legal bases for use
We process your information:
To fulfill a contract, or take steps linked to a contract, including:
Receive, process, and confirm your subscription or registration, and communicate with you about your account.
Allow you to sign in to your account.
Verify your identity.
As required to conduct our business and pursue our legitimate business interests, in particular:
Provide you with our services, and display content you create and post on our services and social media.
Help you when you make customer service requests.
Protect Picsart, our services, and community.
Prevent fraud, abuse, and other misconduct on Picsart.
Help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our website and apps.
Conduct research and development to improve Picsart and develop future products.
Promote your Picsart account for greater discoverability.
Understand how you use the service, to create a better experience for you and other users.
          This includes making inferences, like what content you may be interested in, based on how you use the service. For example, if you frequently save illustrations of penguins to your collections,
          we may infer you have a preference for graphic art over photographic content, or that you are interested in flightless birds.
When required, with your consent or to pursue our legitimate business interests:
Market Picsart services and deliver targeted advertising to you, unless you opt out, as controlled by your settings, email and privacy preferences.
Send cookies or similar technologies to your device, as described in “
cookies and similar technologies
” below.
For legal reasons:
Verify your identity to comply with law.
How and when we share your information
Your Picsart profile and the posts you make are publicly accessible, which means anyone can see your profile photo, name, and description about yourself if you add that information. Creators you follow, creators who follow you, likes, and comments you make are also publicly accessible. We share your information with:
At your direction, services like Facebook, Instagram, or Dropbox so that you can link your Picsart account and publish content to those services.
Service providers we use to process information on our behalf, for the purposes we describe in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may contract with businesses for web hosting and maintenance, security and spam detection, data storage, and analytics and advertising (both described further below). We only engage businesses we believe are trustworthy and who have confirmed their privacy practices are consistent with ours, and we only provide the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each service provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service providers may only use your personal information in ways we specify.
Ad networks and other ad serving providers (collectively, our “Ad Network”) that serve ads on behalf of others on our platform. These practices are described below in “Interest-based advertising.”
Government and law enforcement bodies. We share information when we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety, property, or rights of the public, Picsart, or any third party; or to detect, prevent, or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.
Our subsidiaries and affiliates. We share your personal data with our subsidiaries in order to provide our services to you. We require that our subsidiaries protect your personal information consistent with this privacy policy. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transaction that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy, we may share your information with the parties involved in that transaction.
Cookies and similar technologies
We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device to identify your computer and web browser) and may use anonymous identifiers (random strings of characters that are used for the same purposes as cookies), such as tracking pixels or web beacons. Some cookies are "session cookies" that last until you close your browser, and others are "persistent cookies" that last until you or your browser deletes them.
We use cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons and similar technologies to analyze use of and improve our website and services, to see which areas and features of the website are most popular, to count the number of devices accessing the website, to personalize your experience, and to remember your preferences as described in "
Interest-based advertising
".  For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Picsart.
Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, certain features of the website or services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our service providers may use their own cookies, anonymous identifiers, or other tracking technology in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.
Analytics services
We use third-party analytics service providers such as Google Analytics, Google’s Crashlytics and Firebase services, and Facebook. We may disclose your site use information to these analytics providers to help us learn more about how you and others use our services:

Interest-based advertising
Our Ad Network may serve ads on behalf of Picsart and others on our platform and non-affiliated platforms. Our Ad Network may also serve advertisements to you using personal information, such as your email address, that they may collect directly from you both on our platform and on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information ad networks and ad serving providers collect about your use of our platform and other websites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. Your use of Picsart is supported, in part, by interest-based advertising, without which Picsart would not be able to provide a free or cost-effective experience. Accordingly, you agree that Picsart may display interest-based advertising to you and, if you are using our mobile app, you may enable such activity directly through the app.
Our systems do not recognize "Do Not Track" signals, but several of the third party companies who utilize cookies or beacons on our websites enable you to opt out of this behavioral advertising. We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with interest-based advertising activity. Visit the DAA Webchoices tool at
www.aboutads.info
to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt out choices exercised through the DAA Webchoices tool. Electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our website may not function as intended. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative. To learn more about the Network Advertising Initiative and your opt-out options for their members, see the
NAI Consumer Opt Out
.
We support the ad industry’s
2009 Self-regulatory Principles for    Online Behavioral Advertising
and expect ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-party’s opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us, which you can learn about in "Your options" below.
Your options
If you have registered for an account, you can access, review, and update your personal information by logging into your account on the Picsart app and going to your profile. When logged into your account, you can also update your notification preferences, manage your linked devices, toggle contact syncing, and make other changes to your preferences in the app settings.
On your iOS or Android device you can open the Settings app to change the camera, photos, and other permissions you grant Picsart, to opt out of receiving targeted advertisements from third parties by disabling the advertising identifier, and to modify other settings.
You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the "unsubscribe" link or other means specified in marketing emails you receive from us. However, you cannot opt out of receiving all emails from us, such as service announcements and emails about the status of your account.

Picsart provides you the option to delete the personal information we have collected about you. When provided for by applicable law, you may also have the right to confirm we process your personal information, ask what personal information we have about you, change or correct your personal information, request we stop using some or all of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal information, or request a copy of the personal information you provided to us, in a machine readable format. To exercise any of these rights, including to delete your data, please make a request using Picsart’s
Privacy Request Form
or email us at
privacy@picsart.com
.
You may be entitled to additional rights based on applicable data privacy laws in your jurisdiction. Please review “European Union and UK Privacy Rights” and “US State Privacy Rights” below for more information regarding your privacy rights in those jurisdictions.
Our policy on children's information
You are not allowed to use our services if you are under the age of 13, and our services are not directed at children under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country. If we become aware that we have received personal Information from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information and terminate the person’s account
Our biometric policy
When you use Picsart tools and apply effects to, or generate images of, your face, you understand and agree that Picsart may use facial geometry or other facial data to produce the image or effect you request. We refer to this as “biometric data.” Our technology uses this biometric data to provide the applicable services to you and to improve Picsart. We never use this biometric data to identify any individual person or for authentication purposes.
We only collect, use and store your biometric data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we will only disclose your biometric data in accordance with the section above entitled “How and when we share your information” and, where required by applicable law, you consent to such disclosure. We will not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from your biometric data.
We store your biometric data using a reasonable standard of care and in a manner that is the same or exceeds the standards used to protect other confidential and sensitive information we may hold.
We will destroy your biometric data upon the earliest of: (a) the date when our purpose for collecting or obtaining your biometric data has been satisfied, (b) termination of your Picsart account, or (c) within 3 years of the date your account becomes inactive. We may, however, retain your biometric data for a longer period of time if required by law or required by valid legal subpoena.  We have established  the  following  guidelines  for  permanently  destroying  biometric information,  subject  to the retention period in the prior sentence:  as  appropriate  and  applicable, Picsart will permanently destroy your biometric information by deleting or otherwise removing  such  information  from our records in  line  with industry best practices at the time of the destruction or as otherwise directed by applicable law.
International transfer
We operate worldwide, and we may move, process, and store your data in the United States and any other country where we operate, which may be outside the country where you live. Not all data protection laws are the same. Some countries where we transfer personal data may allow government authorities greater access than your country does.
See the section for EU and UK residents below to learn more about data transfers to and from that region.
European Union and UK Privacy Rights
If you reside in the UK or another member state of the European Union, you have certain rights under applicable data protection legislation. You can ask us to:
Confirm we process your personal data, and ask what personal data we have about you.
Change or fix your data.
Delete your data.
Stop using some or all of your data if we have no legal right to keep using it.
Give you a copy of personal data you provided to us, in machine readable format.
To exercise any of these rights, including to delete your data, please make a request using Picsart’s
Privacy Request Form
or email us at
privacy@picsart.com
. You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you think we haven’t complied with applicable data protection laws, you also have a right to file a complaint with your local data protection
authority.
The data controller for
Picsart’s website and services is PicsArt, Inc., a Delaware company with its registered office at Optima Onyx Tower, Suite 1103, 1010 South Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, FL 33009. Our data protection officer may be reached at
DPO@picsart.com
.
To verify your identity when you make a request, you must provide us with your email address and respond to an email verification request. We will match that information to the information we have in our systems.
Because Picsart is a worldwide service, we may transfer the personal data of EU residents to a country outside of the EU and the UK. When we do, we do so under the EU’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to
third countries (known as "standard contractual clauses").
When you register for an account, we process and retain most personal information we have about you for as long as you are a user of our services. When you close your account, we begin deleting certain personal information that we no longer have a business reason to retain. We may be required to retain certain information about you, such as when there is a legal requirement to do so.
US State Privacy Rights
If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the following rights under the applicable privacy laws in your state ("State Privacy Laws"):
The right to know what personal information we have collected about you, including sources, purpose of collection, and third parties we have shared it with.
The right to delete your personal information.
The right to share or sell your information with any third party.
To exercise any of these rights, including to delete your personal information, please submit your request using Picsart’s
Privacy Request Form
or email us at
privacy@picsart.com
. You must use "Request to Know Information", "Right to Know Categories," "Right to Delete," or "Right on Opt out of Sale/Sharing" or "Right to Correct Information" in the subject line of your email, as appropriate. For requests to know, delete and correct, you must provide us with your first name, last name, and the email address you used when you created your Picsart account, if applicable. Each request must be sent separately.
To fulfill your requests, we must be able to verify your identity in our systems against the identity you provide. You’ll need to provide us with your email address and respond to an email verification request, so we can match that information to the information we have in our systems.
To designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf, you must send a signed, written authorization containing your first name, last name, email address, and phone number to:
PicsArt, Inc.
Attn: Legal
Optima Onyx Tower, Suite 1103, 1010 South Federal Highway
Hallandale Beach, FL 33009
We will process your request in an efficient manner, but we may not be able to delete your personal information (i) if we have to complete an ongoing transaction with you, (ii) if we detect or need to address a data security incident, if we need to preserve the integrity or security of our systems, or if we need to investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for any such action, (iii) in order to correct or repair an error, (iv) in order to protect against harassment or malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, (v) in order to comply with a legal requirement or to assist another party with any of its legal obligations under applicable privacy laws, or (vi) if we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as if we use it internally in a lawful manner to improve our services or to communicate with you about your account. We will also maintain a record of your requests. If we delete your personal information, many of our services will not work the same for you. For example, your previous opt-out requests will not be saved, your account will be deleted, any edited photos, videos, or other media will be deleted, and saved preferences and information will no longer be available.
Do Not Sell or Share/Use My Personal Information for Targeted Advertising
Residents in states with State Privacy Laws can opt-out of both sales of their personal information and the use of their information for targeted advertising (known as “sharing” in California). “Sale” includes most circumstances in which a business makes personal information available to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. In California “sharing” includes circumstances in which a business makes personal information available to a third party specifically for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising (also known as retargeting or interest-based advertising across platforms), even if no money is exchanged. Thus, when we use the term “share” under this section, we are using it in the narrow meaning of how it is defined under California law. Other State Privacy Laws do not use the term “share,” but describe the activity as using personal information for targeted advertising.
Through our participation in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising tailored to your interests, we may sell or share/use for targeted advertising the following categories of personal information: identifiers, internet and electronic activity and commercial information. You can opt-out of us selling or sharing/using your personal information for targeted advertising for online activity by visiting
privacy.picsart.com
or emailing us at privacy@picsart.com to submit your request.
California users under the age of 18 may request the removal of their content publicly posted in our services by emailing us at
privacy@picsart.com
. You will need to describe the content you want removed in enough detail to allow us to locate it, or we may not be able to process your request. In some cases, complete removal of your content may not be possible because your content may have been reposted (in whole or in part) by other users. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under the age of 16.
Right to Appeal
If you are a Colorado, Connecticut or Virginia resident and we were unable to fulfill your request, you may appeal by emailing us at privacy@picsart.com within fourteen days of our decision and submitting an appeal request with a detailed reason for your appeal, as well as your state of residence.
Sensitive Personal Information
We do not collect or process Sensitive Personal Information, as defined by California Law, for inferring characteristics or use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those permitted by law. In addition, we do not “sell” or “share” Sensitive Personal Information, as “sell” and “share” are defined above in the “Do Not Sell or Share/Use My Personal Information for Targeted Advertising” section.
Retention
We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.
How we make changes to this policy
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect our current practices and ensure compliance with applicable laws, so please check back frequently for changes. The most current version will always be at
https://www.picsart.com/privacy
. If we make material changes, we may notify you through other methods as required by law, such as at picsart.com, in our mobile applications, by sending email to the email address associated with your account, or by push notifications to your device if you’ve enabled them. If you continue to use Picsart after those changes are in effect, you agree to the new policy.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.

Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).
