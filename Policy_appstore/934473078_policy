                    your online use).

                        and/or,
With our affiliated companies, subsidiaries, or divisions.
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries,
                    affiliates, assets, or
                    other business units. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets,
                    information we have
                    collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any
                    bankruptcy or
                    reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be
                    considered an asset
                    of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should such a sale or
                    transfer occur, we
                    will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal
                    information provided
                    through the Sites in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Psytech may also share aggregate or anonymous non-personal information with
                    third parties, including
                    affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies, for their marketing or
                    analytics uses.
Sharing with Service Providers
Our operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your
                    information in the
                    course of providing products or services to Psytech. These contractors include
                    vendors and suppliers
                    that provide us various products and services, including, but not limited to,
                    credit card
                    processing, e-mail distribution technology, live operator services, and/or
                    content for the operation
                    and maintenance of our Sites. Access to your information by these contractors is
                    limited to the
                    information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited
                    function for Psytech. We
                    also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors (1)
                    protect the privacy
                    of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (2) not
                    use or disclose your
                    personal information for any purpose other than providing us with products and
                    services, except as
                    required by law.
Our Psychics/Your Privacy
Note that our psychics are independent contractors and not employed directly by
                    Psytech. We
                    contractually require that our psychics protect the privacy of your personal
                    information consistent
                    with this Privacy Policy and not use or disclose your personal information for
                    any purpose other
                    than providing you with the services you request through the Sites or by phone.
                    You should also take
                    care to protect your personal information and privacy. There is no reason that
                    you should provide
                    any of our psychics with personal contact information, specific financial
                    information, including,
                    but not limited to, account numbers or other confidential information related to
                    your identity. It
                    is a violation of our Terms and Conditions for you to be in direct contact with
                    any of our psychics
                    outside the service – if you do so, Psytech bears no liability for any resulting
                    actions, and your
                    ability to use our services may be revoked.

5. Retention of Your Data
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as
                needed to provide you
                services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to address

                balances, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
                agreements.
6. International Transfers
Psytech is a global business and it, or its service providers, may process,
                transfer, and store
                information about our users on servers located in a number of countries outside
                the European
                Economic Area (EEA), including in the United States. Since we are committed to
                protecting your
                information, we take steps to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards in
                place when we transfer
                that data.
7. How We Secure Your Information
Psytech is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of
                information
                security. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply
                with federal
                regulations and generally accepted standards to guard your nonpublic personal
                information, both
                during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information
                (such as a credit
                card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information
                using secure socket
                layer technology (SSL).
                No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
                100% secure,
                however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any
                questions about
                security on our Sites, you can contact us at
help@7thsensepsychics.com.
8. Testimonials
We display personal testimonials of customers on our Sites in addition to other
                endorsements. With
                your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to
                update or delete your
                testimonial, you can contact us at
help@7thsensepsychics.com.
9. Third Party Content, Links, and Plug-ins
Our Sites include links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ
                from those of Psytech.
                If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is
                governed by their
                privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites, and
                encourage you to
                carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.
                The Sites may offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social
                media sites, such as
                the Facebook Like and Share buttons, and other widgets and interactive
                mini-programs that run on our
                Sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting
                on our Sites, and may
                set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features
                and widgets are
                either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. As with linked
                sites, we have no
                control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social
                network plugins, and are
                not responsible for the practices of such sites. In addition, we may receive
                certain information
                about you from a third party social network if you choose to link to us or use
                certain social media
                features, based on your registration and privacy settings on those third party
                services.
10. Send to a Friend
If you choose to use our referral function to tell a friend about our Sites, we
                will ask you for your
                friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a
                one-time email inviting
                him or her to visit the Sites. Psytech stores this information for the sole
                purpose of sending this
                one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may
                contact us at
help@7thsensepsychics.com

                request that
                we remove this information from our database.
11. Children's Privacy
Protecting children's privacy is important to us. Our Sites are not intended for
                use by anyone under
                the age of 16. Psytech does not knowingly collect or store personal information
                from anyone under
                the age of 16. Premium services may not be used by anyone under the age of 18.
                If you have concerns
                about our Sites or the services offered on our Sites, or if you believe that
                your child under 16 has
                gained access to our Sites, you may contact us at
help@7thsensepsychics.com
12. Revisions to this Privacy Policy
Psytech reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add,
                remove, or otherwise
                revise portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will post the
                change(s) on the
                Sites. Your continued use of the Sites following the posting of changes to these
                terms means you
                accept these changes. If we change the Privacy Statement in a material way, we
                will provide
                appropriate notice to you.
