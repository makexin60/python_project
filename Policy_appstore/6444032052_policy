Our Legal Basis for Using your Information
We always ensure that we respect your privacy rights. This means that we can only collect your personal data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. If the data is particularly sensitive, we may need additional justification. In most cases, we may rely on the following grounds:
Contractual necessity:
we may have a contractual arrangement with you and to fulfil our obligations we need to process your personal data (e.g you are a client or supplier). This lawful basis also applies prior to entry into the contract, including also where you have applied for a job with us, so we can consider you for employment. It may also become relevant in the management of enquiries or complaints.
Compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject:
there may be a legal obligation for us to process your personal data (e.g. so we can properly identify you).
For our legitimate interests or those of a third party
: we may want to fulfil a compelling legitimate interest, provided that we have balanced these against your fundamental rights and freedoms.

Your information collected through the app may be stored and processed in Belgium or any other country where Hoppy, its customers, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Hoppy, its customers, affiliates or service providers may transfer information we collect about you, including personal information across borders and out of your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in another region with laws governing the collection and use of data that may differ from the laws of Belgium, the Laws in force will always apply. Please note that we may transfer information, including personal data, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. However, where such transfers take place, we will rely on Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission to transfer data from the EEA, Switzerland and/or Gibraltar to the United States and other countries outside of where you might live.
Hoppy will take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of your personal information.

Applicable law
This app is published in Belgium. We try to protect the personal information of all users of our app and we try to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent that they may apply to the services, but our app is based and directed at European citizens and our policy is to comply with these corresponding laws.

Allocation
We may sell certain assets associated with the app. As a result, you should be aware that in such an event we may transfer some or all of your information to a company that acquires all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged. In such circumstances, we should, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that any acquiring company or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Changes to this policy

We will prominently post those changes so you will always know what information we collect, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

What are your choices and how can you opt out?
We believe you should have choices about how your information is collected, used and shared. While you may not opt out of all data collection when you visit our apps, you may limit the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information.

You are not permitted to examine the personal information of any other person or entity, and may need to provide us with personal information to verify your identity before accessing data containing information about you. We may not honor any request to modify or delete personal information if we believe that to do so would violate legal or regulatory requirements, or that the information is inaccurate.

As described above, we may also outsource the processing of your information to, or otherwise share your information with, trusted service providers and trusted business partners in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States and Canada, in accordance with applicable law. Such third parties may be engaged, among other things, in providing services to you, processing transactions and/or providing support services. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge such transfer, storage or use.
If you are an EU data subject, when we transfer information about you to such non-EEA members of our group or to third party information processors, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that such companies adequately protect your information in accordance with this privacy policy. These measures include signing standard contractual clauses in accordance with EU and other data protection legislation to govern transfers of such data.
