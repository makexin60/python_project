Our mobile application (the 'App') hosts an online community where users can access resources, set goals, log daily activities, and track long-term progress.
This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and forms part of our Terms of Service.
AGREEMENT:
Before using the Service or submitting any Personal Data to BetBreaker, please review this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us if you have any questions. By using the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use, maintenance, and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site or otherwise use the Service.
PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
We collect information that alone or in combination with other information in our possession could be used to identify you ('Personal Data') as follows:
Personal Data You Provide:
We collect the following categories of Personal Data from you when you create an account, sign up for our newsletter, use the Service, or communicate with us:
Identification Data: We collect your name, email address, and unique identifiers assigned by third-party platforms (such as analytics or communication tools). If you sign up using credentials from a third-party account such as Apple, we may collect your name and email address from the applicable third party.
Daily log Data: We collect information you log in, relating to your daily habits.
Communication Data: We may collect information when you contact us with questions or concerns and when you voluntarily respond to questionnaires, surveys, or requests for market research seeking your opinion and feedback. Providing this information is optional to you.
Social Media Data: We have pages on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, Medium, Twitter, and LinkedIn (â€œSocial Media Pagesâ€). When you interact with our Social Media Pages, we will collect Personal Data that you elect to provide to us, such as your contact details. In addition, the companies that host our Social Media Pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics regarding the use of our Social Media Pages.
Cookies:
We use cookies to operate and administer our Site, gather usage data on our Site, and improve your experience on it. A 'cookie' is a piece of information sent to your browser by a website you visit. Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time. Some cookies expire after a certain amount of time, or upon logging out (session cookies), others survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the third party placing it), and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again (persistent cookies).

All About Cookies
.
On most web browsers, you will find a 'help' section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive a notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Please see the links below for guidance on how to modify your web browserâ€™s settings on the most popular browsers:
Internet Explorer
Mozilla Firefox
Google Chrome
Apple Safari
Please note that if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site, and you may not be able to benefit from the full functionality of the Site.
Web Beacons:
We may deliver a file to you through the Service (known as a â€œweb beaconâ€) from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad networkâ€™s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Service by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we donâ€™t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests. If you access the Site on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through the settings.
Analytics:
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ('Google'). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Site. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
. We utilize Amplitude, a third-party analytics service, to track and analyze user interactions within our app. Amplitude collects various data points, including but not limited to app usage patterns, device information, and anonymized IP addresses. This information helps us understand user behavior, evaluate app performance, and make data-driven improvements to our services. Amplitude's data practices are governed by its own Privacy Policy.
HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA
Aggregated Information:
We may aggregate Personal Data and use the aggregated information to analyze the effectiveness of our Service, to improve and add features to our Service, and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may analyze the general behavior and characteristics of users of our Service and share aggregated information like general user statistics with prospective business partners. We may collect aggregated information through the Service, through cookies, and through other means described in this Privacy Policy.
Marketing:
We may use your Personal Data (excluding Health Data) to contact you to tell you about products or services we believe may be of interest to you. For instance, if you elect to provide your email, we may use that information to send you special offers. You may opt out of receiving emails by following the instructions contained in each promotional email we send you. You can also control the marketing emails and/or push messages you receive by updating your settings through your account. In addition, if at any time you do not wish to receive future marketing communications, you may contact us. If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, you will no longer receive marketing communications but we will continue to contact you regarding management of your account, other administrative matters, and to respond to your requests.
SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA
BetBreaker does not engage in the sale of your Personal Data. In certain situations, we may share the aforementioned categories of Personal Data with specific categories of third parties without further notice, except as required by law. These categories include:
Vendors and Service Providers:
We may share Personal Data with vendors and service providers to fulfill business operations needs and carry out specific services and functions. These parties may include providers of cloud hosting/computing services, database providers, email delivery and in-app/push messaging services, advertising and marketing services, payment processors, content monitoring services, and web, subscription, and app analytics services. These service providers access, process, or store Personal Data as instructed by us. We take reasonable steps to ensure that our service providers adhere to our security standards for your Personal Data.
Business Transfers:
In the event of a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider ("Transaction"), your Personal Data and other information may be shared with counterparties and parties assisting with the Transaction during the diligence process. They may also be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction, along with other assets.
Legal Requirements:
We may disclose Personal Data if required by law or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) prevent fraud, (iv) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Service users or the public, or (v) protect against legal liability.
Other Users:
Certain user profile information, such as your name, location, and any uploaded video or image content, may be displayed to other users to facilitate interaction within the Service or address your Service requests. Your account privacy settings allow you to control the visibility of Personal Data in your user profile and determine what information is visible to others. Please note that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any voluntarily disclosed Personal Data or content visible to others (such as on discussion boards, blogs, messages, and chat areas), becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by anyone. Additionally, your username may be displayed to other users.
SECURITY
We implement appropriate security measures to protect the information collected through our app. However, please note that no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
CHILDREN S PRIVACY

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
