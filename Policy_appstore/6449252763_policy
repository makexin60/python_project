In this statement we explain how “we respect your privacy in relation to the information you provide to us when you use
this website and any AIB App
.
When we talk about Apps we mean an AIB application which can either be downloaded from a software application to a mobile device or is available on a Kiosk or tablet in branch and can be used to access AIB Internet Banking and/or any Banking Services.

Information we collect and Use
When you visit our website and/or our Apps we collect information relating to your interactions through these online channels.
In some cases the information we collect will be anonymous and it will simply tell us what pages have received the most activity and are of particular interest to our customers in general.
Where you log onto and use Internet Banking we will be able to identify what pages you have shown a particular interest in, what pages you have visited multiple times and also what pages you have spent the most amount of time on. We will mostly do this work ourselves however sometimes we will use Google Analytics to assist us. In all cases we will carry this work out in a responsible manner.
We will always let you know how we intend to use your information before collecting it, so that you can decide whether or not you wish to provide that information.
We may collect and process information about you such as:
Information you give us when applying for a product or service;
Information (e.g. phone location) from your mobile to verify you are a resident in the Republic of Ireland when opening a new current account remotely;
What pages you have viewed;
Certain interactions you have had on those pages;
The number of times you may have visited a particular page; and/or
The amount of time you may have spent on certain pages.
This information enables us to provide you with a more efficient and effective customer service by developing a wider understanding and appreciation of our customer base. Where we have identified you specifically we can offer you a more bespoke user experience and assist you with any customer service issues you may have experienced or may be experiencing.
To use your information lawfully, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases:
performance of a contract
legal obligation;
protecting the vital interests of you or others;
public interest;
our legitimate interests; and
your consent.
To meet our regulatory and legal obligations, we collect some of your personal information, verify it, keep it up to date through regular checks, and delete it once we no longer have to keep it. We may also gather information about you from third parties to help us meet our obligations. If you do not provide the information we need, or help us keep it up to date, we may not be able to provide you with our products and services.
Sometimes we need your consent to use your personal information. With direct marketing for example, we need your consent to make you aware of products and services which may be of interest to you. We may do this by phone, post, email, text or through other digital media. When we use sensitive personal information about you, such as medical or biometric data, we ask for your consent. Before you give your consent, we tell you what information we collect and what we use it for. You can remove your consent at any time by contacting us.
Interactive Areas
Our website and Apps will sometimes offer chat options which allow you to speak directly with an AIB staff member while you are browsing online. Sometimes these chat options will appear automatically on your screen, they are an optional service and you can decide whether or not you wish to interact with them. This chat service is governed by the terms and conditions of use for aib.ie which are available on our website and which you should read before using a chat option. It is important that when you interact with these chat options and other Interactive Areas (discussion forums, bulletin boards, blogs) you do so in a responsible way.

AIB Social Media Privacy Statement
When we communicate on social media channels our communications are public and so are any posts and comments that you may make. Your posts and comments may also show up in search-engine results, for example Google.
You should only communicate information that you are happy to have published in the public domain.
You should protect your privacy and your confidential information. It is dangerous to include any bank account details, financial information or other sensitive information in any content you post on our social media accounts.
The privacy policies, statements and guidance published by Social Media Networks apply to your use of our accounts under those networks. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and guidance published on each Social Media Network that you use, as these make important disclosures about how the Social Media Networks separately collect, hold and may use your content and information.
We use a third-party platform to manage our social media interactions with you. If you send a comment or direct message to our social media accounts, we will see all this information and decide how we manage it. This is how we may use the information that you place on our social media accounts:
Customer Service
We can help to resolve any questions you might have but we will not be able to discuss anything specific to your account. To help answer some questions, we may ask you to provide more information. In these instances, we will ask you to send us a private message.
We will use any personal information you give to us solely to respond to and deal with your comments or questions, or for such other purpose for which you give it to us. We won’t share your information with any other third party but we may share it internally to help resolve your issue or question.
Community Management
If you use our social media accounts to enter competitions or to post comments, photographs or other content, please be aware that the content may be public and may be seen or shared by anyone. We would encourage you to review your privacy settings before you post.
We may ask promotion winners to take part in promotional activity and we may ask to use your information, including your name and the contents of your submissions, in any publicity both online and in any other media. In these instances, we will send you a private message.
Social Listening and Insights
Social listening involves the gathering of feedback and information from social media channels to collate insights and themes about us and our industry. We use this information to help us to better understand how we can improve our products and services. All personal information and feedback is anonymised. These insights may include, but are not limited to:
Sentiment analysis
Demographical analysis
Engagement on our social media accounts
Social media question analysis
