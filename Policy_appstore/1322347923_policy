b. Because we maintain our records in a manner protecting from accidental or malicious loss and destruction,
    residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of
    time.
c. We reserve the right to retain your identification data for an indefinite duration if you have been placed on our company's internal blacklist due to suspected malicious, fraudulent, or analogous behavior. This retention is predicated on our legitimate interest in preventing such individuals from accessing our services in the future.

    you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any
    processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable
    law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you
    contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of
    your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but
    you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to
    the processing and pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override your own.
3.5 Objection to Processing.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for
    certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we
    will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
    grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
    claims. In case you do not wish us to process your personal data for certain specific purposes, which are legitimate
    purposes to us, we may have to stop providing you some or all of the services.

IV. Specific data sharing.
In any case, we may share any of your information for specific reasons, outlined below:
1. With other members of the iCard AD corporate family:
We may share your Personal Data with members of the iCard Group of companies that are related by common ownership or control, so that we may provide the Services you have requested or authorized or to manage the risk, or to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements and to help us manage the availability and connectivity of iCard For Business Service and communications.
2. With our business introducers/promoters:
We may share information related to you or your company with our parnters, which help us to provide you with the best iCard experience. Our partners may help us in onboarding you or your company, with your transactions, orders and other similar activities, for which they may process some of your personal information.
3. With our agents:
In some cases, in order to provide you with some of the functionalities of the service, we may rely on agents in the sense that the payment services regulations give to these terms. You can find a list of iCard registered agents on the official website of the Bulgarian National Bank. We are currently using such providers for the following functionalities:
a) Providing you with the online iCard.com platform and mobile app;
b) Providing you with the option to initiate payment transactions or other linked activities in certain physical location across Europe;
c) Providing you with the option to order payments to certain organisations, such as tax authorities, municipalities, utility suppliers and other similar;
4. Aggregated Data.
We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other anonymized information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.
5. With our legal counsels for the purposes of protecting our legal rights.
We may share any information which is necessary to protect our legal rights to legal counsels or similar parties.
6. Monitoring.
We may monitor or record telephone calls, emails, web chat or other communications with you for regulatory, security, customer services or training purposes. When visiting our offices, CCTV, access control systems and/or other monitoring systems may be in operation.
7. Business Transfers.
If any of the companies that provides iCard For Business Service is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, transfer of portfolio, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred to a different legal person and/or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
V. Decisions based solely on automated processing.
Sometimes, our systems may take decisions based solely on automated processing. This does not mean that we will always use automated decision making for these processing activities. In case you believe that you have been unfairly treated by our automated decision-making systems you may ask that a person reviews the decision at all times by contacting us as described in the “How do I complain?” section. Such decisions may be done for processing activities that include:
Processing activity
Automated processing logic
Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, security incidents, and other harmful activity by blocking iCard For Business Service or by applying other fraud prevention measures.

VI. Information collected about you from third parties.
We may ask certain entities for information about you when you are enrolling for our services.
Such entities are generally fraud prevention agencies and Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering Checkup service providers which help us to fulfil our legal obligations for due diligence on our customers.
We may also collect information about you from public sources for Anti Money Laundering reasons or market research. This includes:
a) official public records, like your national Company register;
b) information published by the press or on social media.
In case you use any of the linked services, provided by one of our partners or afiiliated companies, such as the insurance services provided by iCard Insurance Broker, or the credit card services of iCard Credit, they may share details with us about the relationship with you.
VII. Data Retention and Erasure.
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our regulatory obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide iCard For Business Service to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your iCard For Business Account, providing your account is in good standing, not blocked or somehow limited for compliance, risk or regulatory reasons, or due to your outstanding obligation to us, court order, pledge or order by another regulator or other reason which prevent us by law to close your account or terminate the Service. In case the Data Controller is a regulated financial institution, such as credit institution, E-money institution or similar, such Data Controller is obliged under PSD and AML laws to keep your personal information and all transactions history for a period of 5 years after the termination of the relation with you (or where the laws of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are applicable – for a period of 6 years). Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing security. For example, if we suspend a iCard For Business Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that iCard For Business Account to prevent that client from opening a new iCard For Business Account in the future. We are also obliged to retain personal data which we have collected for the purposes of complying with the relevant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing for a period as defined under the applicable law.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, iCard may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
Because we maintain our records in a manner protecting from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
We reserve the right to retain your identification data for an indefinite duration if you have been placed on our company's internal blacklist due to suspected malicious, fraudulent, or analogous behavior. This retention is predicated on our legitimate interest in preventing such individuals from accessing our services in the future.
