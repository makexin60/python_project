Withdrawal of consent
Users are informed that they may withdraw their consent at any time for any processing based on their consent.

‚ö†Ô∏è
The user's attention is drawn to the fact that deleting some data may render the application functional in degraded mode or even impossible for certain functions since this could create cases not foreseen by the application's developers.
Data entered by the user
The data entered may change as the application and platforms evolve.
UUID (Unique User IDentifier)
A UUID (Unique User IDentifier) can be described as a universal unique identifier.
Each Kwit user is assigned a UUID to ensure that he or she is uniquely recognized by the application. So, even if two people had the same pseudonym, the application could differentiate between them thanks to their respective UUIDs.
A UUID in the application is unique to you, and no one else shares this number. Every time you use the app, this number makes it possible to know who you are, track your actions, and provide your personal information and preferences without mixing them with anyone else's.
