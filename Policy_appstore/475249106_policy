Feathr.co Technology & Website Privacy Policy
This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our Website and Technology.
About Us
Feathr is an online advertising and event marketing platform headquartered in the United States. We provide this privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform (“Technology”) processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our services (collectively, our “Customers”).
Feathr runs a marketing platform. The Feathr Technology allows our Customers to buy ad space on websites for online advertising and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that media. When ad space on or within a website or mobile application is bought or sold (usually to an advertiser or ad agency by a web publisher) the Technology, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet and mobile users who visit that site or use that application. Generally, an Internet user’s computer comes into contact with Feathr when a user views an ad, opens an email, or visits a website, delivered or serviced by or with our Technology. Serving users relevant advertising is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising or online behavioral advertising, also known as “IBA” or “
OBA
”
Technology
Last Edited on 2018-06-19
Our fundamental principal is that when advertising is tailored to a user based on their interests and behavior, it is mutually beneficial to the user and the business wishing to engage with them. To do this, we collect a variety of data from Customers and across platforms, including from other third party platforms and providers, to help optimize ads and increase the likelihood that a particular unique, but anonymous users will be interested in an ad they see.
Our Technology collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) that may include, but is not limited to, your IP host address, the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer’s operating system, as well as how you interact with a web page or ad. We may also receive Non-PII such as age, gender, income, education, interests, and usage activity from Customers or other third parties, such as other data and advertising platforms we work with. We may assign a unique, non-PII identifier to your browser or device, such as an identifier associated with a “cookie” on your browser, and this identifier may likewise be associated with any other (anonymous or de-identified) information we have collected about, or otherwise learned or inferred about you.
We also may collect or receive analogous Non-PII from mobile platforms or applications, which may include information about your interactions with those platforms or applications (including your IP address and time-stamp information), your precise geolocation information (such as latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates), and information about your mobile device (including device type, handset name, operating system information, mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID, app-specific identifiers, and a list of the applications your device interacts with).
Sometimes, we obtain the above information from other ad platforms, application platforms or providers, customers or websites and services (including our Customers).
Customers may also choose to provide us with personally identifiable information such as an email address, name, username or other identifier or any other PII.
How We Use Information Collected
Feathr uses Non-PII and, if it is provided to us by a Customer, to target and serve relevant advertising to users and to perform attribution analysis or other analytics regarding advertising audiences, as well as to compile, match and link audiences on behalf of Customers. For instance, we may use information, generally on behalf of Customer, to:
Determine what ad to show a user, and customize ads to particular types of audiences;
Customize ads to the type of web page users are viewing;
Limit the number of times a user sees an ad or a type of ad;
Perform analysis of how effective ads are;
Help advertisers learn more about their own users.
Sometimes we may use or make available to Customers the Non-PII we collect or receive (such as IP Address) to recognize users or try to resolve a commonality of users (or households) across platforms or across devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers. For instance, we might infer that a common IP address seen across different devices represents a common user (or a related or similar user), and use that inference in tailoring ads. If a Customer provides us with PII, we may also use PII, or a combination of PII and Non-PII for this purpose. Occasionally, we use or create anonymized data sets (which may constitute hashed or obfuscated personally identifiable information), in order to promote, test or validate the accuracy of such inferences.
Cookies and Web Beacons
In order to help make the online advertisements more relevant to users, our Technology uses the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on users’ computers about users’ visits to certain websites. We also use cookies to understand users’ browsing and buying activities so that we can measure the success of online advertising campaigns we run.
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website. Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user visits a website or views an advertisement. Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visits – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics. This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, making the website easier to use, measuring the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailoring their website (including the ads and offers they receive) to better match a user’s interests and preferences. Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive.
Feathr also uses web beacons (also known as 1×1 gifs), along with cookies, to determine if a user has visited a particular website. These beacons aid in providing more relevant advertising to the user, as well measuring the success of an advertising campaign, but provide no personally identifiable information.
Information Sharing
Feathr may share the non-PII that we collect and receive in various ways.
Primarily, we may work with Customers and other third parties to help optimize ads and make them more likely to be relevant to users, by comparing, syncing and sharing the non-PII described above. For instance, we may disclose to other ad platforms, customers or websites and services (including our Customers), non-PII we have collected (generally, unique, anonymous identifiers representing users’ browsers), to match their unique identifiers to our own, so that we can “sync” identifiers in order to help them show more relevant ads, match users to their likely interests, or better synchronize, cap, or otherwise optimize advertising.
Finally, we may share aggregated, non-personal information with Customers in connection with reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis (such as the creation of predictive models).
Feathr may share the PII provided to us by a Customer with that Customer for the provision of services to that Customer and as set forth in this policy, including in order to assist Customers with targeted advertising. We may sync or combine Non-PII that has been shared with third parties (as set forth above) with PII, and we may share the combined data with the Customer who provided us with the PII.
We may also share PII, Non-PII or any combination thereof:
to be processed on our behalf by third-party service providers that assist us in running our business, including providers of data storage and processing facilities.
we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual activities that may harm any person, our company, the Technology, or otherwise violate any law.
Also, in the event Feathr is merged into another company, or another company acquires all or substantially all of Feathr’s assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, all data compiled or owned by Feathr may be among the items transferred in that transaction.
