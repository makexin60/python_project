Who We Are
When we refer to “FormX,” “we,” or “us” in this policy, we mean Skymakers Digital Limited, which controls the information FormX collects when you use FormX’s Services. FormX owns and operates a number of websites and API services.
This Privacy Policy applies to our customers, prospective customers, our customers’ customers/users and visitors to

What Information Do We Collect About You?
Account and Profile Information
While using our Services, we may ask you for certain personal information that can be used to contact and identify you, such as your name, email address, social media accounts, phone numbers, and payment information. When you contact our support team, we may also collect information such as contact information, documentation, or other information that will be helpful in solving the issue.
Content You Provide Through Our Products
To effectively deliver the Services to you, we need to be able to handle the content you provide to our products. There are two main categories of content we collect:
1. Files Uploaded for API extraction
This includes files uploaded via FormX portal to FormX API endpoints and directly to FormX API endpoints for document information extraction service. All files uploaded for this purpose and any information extracted from document content will not be stored in any permanent storage (for sync mode service) or stored temporarily with encryption in database and deleted permanently after extraction result is retrieved or the job expired (for async mode service).
2. Other Contents
Examples of other content we collect and store include, but are not limited to, name of your account, email of team members, files, content you uploaded, or inputs to this website, FormX portal, or provided to our support team members via other channels.
Your Activity
We collect information about your activity when using our products to help us improve the product. The information we collect include, but are not limited to, your API usage, metadata of the contents you uploaded, the actions you carry out at the dashboard, the pages you visit, and the time you stay on the dashboard.

How We Share Information We Collect
Sharing With Other Service Users
Our Services allow you to add collaborators to your team. Once given the permission, collaborators will be able to access, edit, copy, and download the information of your FormX configurations and usage records. They will also see the contact information of other collaborators of the same team.
Sharing with Third Parties
We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis, and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they will only have the access to the necessary information to perform those tasks and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
How We Store and Secure Information We Collect
We use data hosting service providers in the United States, Taiwan, Singapore, depending on which region you signed up, to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. However, no security system is impenetrable due to the inherent nature of the internet. We cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our systems, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable time frame.
