Data processed with the data subject's consent
To effectively and promptly use certain services, ATB Mobile app requires, before accessing the device's geolocation data, the explicit consent of the data subject. The lack of consent does not affect its operating, although, for obvious reasons, it may limit its functions.
Types of processed data
Data provided by the data subject
Firstly, we have to specify that ATB Mobile app does not process personal data belonging to special categories (biometric, genetic, and/or health-related). The personal data processed by the ATB Mobile app, if expressly provided by the data subject, belong to the following categories:
Device geolocation
Email address
Favourites (stops)
Browsing data
ATB Mobile app automatically acquires information from the data subject's device regarding the operating system used and its version, the permanence and the used functions, with the aim of allowing developers to make its services more an d more efficient and to intervene in case of anomalies.
This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of the computers and terminals used by users, URI/URL (Uniform Resource Identifier/Locator) addresses of the requested resources, the time of the request, the method used in submitting the request to the server, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), and other parameters relating to the user's operating system and IT environment. Those data, necessary for the use of web services, are also processed to monitor the correct functioning of the offered services.
Browsing data do not persist for more than 30 days and are immediately deleted after their aggregation (except for any need for criminal investigations by the Judicial Authority).
Cookies and other tracking systems
No cookies are used for user profiling, nor are third-party cookies used.
Technical cookies are instead used strictly limited to what is necessary for the efficient and secure usability of ATB Mobile app:
navigation and session cookies: login data and data of purchased tickets saved on the device's memory
analytics cookies (if managed by the Publisher): presence of Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics Italia, which monitor user navigation.
The storage of session cookies in the cache and in the ATB Mobile app memory is under the user's control, whereas on the servers, at the end of HTTPS sessions, information regarding cookies remains recorded in the service logs, with storage times not exceeding 30 days, similar to other browsing data.
The Firebase installation token is also present for sending the user push notifications related to service content publication and is not traceable to the individual.
Required and optional data
Required data
ATB Mobile app requires mandatory registration, only for the provision of some functions detailed below, entering User Access data (User Login):
TICKETS
ACCOUNT
MANAGEMENT OF FUNCTIONS RESERVED FOR ATB OPERATORS
The lack to provide certain data necessary for registration or portal registration precludes the possibility of providing the requested service.
Optional data
The Authorization to Access device Geolocation data, already subject to explicit consent, remains optional but important for effective management of the following services:
Home – locates the user's position on the map ;
Route planner – set the route by indicating only the destination;
Routes and timetables – selecting the route number displays on the map the nearest stop to the user;
Parkings list – shows before the nearest car park to the user.
Conservation period
We specify that the ATB Mobile app does not store the data subject's Credit Card information. Therefore, new consent is required for each use. In addition to what has already been specified for browsing data and cookies, it is specified that on the device, purchase data relating to transactions made for the BUY TICKET services are stored until they are deleted by the data subject. The storage on the data subject's device of other purchased services is only possible if the data subject connects the ATB Mobile app to the ATB portal (Login and Password) to which it is linked.
Data recipients
The data provided may be communicated to public or private affiliated entities for the provision of the requested service, to public or private entities not having a commercial nature, or to the Judicial Authority in accordance with legal or regulatory provisions.
Transfer of data abroad
Data is not transferred to third countries outside the EU. (including sub-processors appointed by the provider e.g., Cloud).
Rights of the data subject
ATB Mobile app allows the data subject to exercise their rights of access, rectification, and updating at any time and directly, if incomplete or incorrect, or deletion. Regarding data deletion, in particular, the data subject can do so directly from the Options menu – App – ATB Mobile – Memory – DELETE DATA.
For this purpose, if further instructions are needed, they can contact the ATB Point, atbpoint@atb.bergamo.it – 035 236026.
For the exercise of rights, the data subject can also contact the designated Data Controller as the point of contact for data subjects, or the Data Protection Officer. Finally, it is informed that there is the possibility of lodging a complaint with the Italian Supervisory Authority - Garante for the protection of personal data - Piazza Venezia 11 – 00187 Roma.
