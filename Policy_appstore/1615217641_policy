Privacy Policy
This
SERVICE
is provided by Helixform at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at This Product unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
Information Collection and Use
While using our Free Service, we never ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information.
The app does not use any third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
This Service does not use these
cookies
explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use
cookies
to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
Data Collection
Our app may collect your device identifier and send it to our license server to validate the copy. Based on the user preferences, some telemetry data may be sent to Apple and shared with us. When the telemetry is turned off, the telemetry events may still be recorded locally on the user’s computer, but they won’t be sent to the server.
The collected information is solely used to provide service, develop and further improve the app.
Screen Recording
To function correctly, some apps require macOS Screen Recording permission to capture screen contents. All screen recordings belong to the user and are controlled by the user. They are only processed locally on the user's device, and will never leave the user’s device.
Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Links to Other Sites
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Children's Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
