Performance tracking technologies
These tracking technologies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular, and see how visitors move around the site. They also help us understand where our users are coming from. If these tracking technologies are declined, no user specific information related to our site performance will be stored.
Targeting tracking technologies
These tracking technologies may be set and used by our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They don’t store personal data, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you don’t allow these tracking technologies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
Functional/Personalization tracking technologies
These tracking technologies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation to make the content of the site more specific for you as a user. If you don’t allow these tracking technologies, all of the functions we use to personalise the site will not function properly.
