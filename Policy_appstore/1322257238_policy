We may also collect and store information locally on your device, using mechanisms like cookies, browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
C.Information Provided to Us by Third Parties
Apps. If you play or purchase our games on your mobile device and/or any other device such as a tablet etc., we receive information about you from the app stores and other mobile platform providers. This information includes your username and/or device ID and the fact that you made a purchase, for instance, but does not include any sensitive or financial information. Some of our Apps may send information to us that you authorize them to provide. Our Apps also may request additional Personal Information from you, such as push notification tokens, your precise location or contact list, and we will collect this information only if you give us your explicit consent.
 
Other Third Parties. We may receive information from third parties, like Facebook or Game Center, when you use these service providers in connection with our Services. We may also receive information about you when other players choose to share their contact lists with us. We may also receive information from third parties legally to supplement the information we receive from you. We use information from these companies primarily to help us deliver relevant advertising to you. We also may use information from third parties, for instance, to help us understand your approximate geolocation via your IP address for tax purposes, or to customize certain Services to your location, and for fraud and/or abuse prevention purposes.â€¨ 
3.HOW DO WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION
We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you talk with our customer experience team. We and third parties also use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.
A.Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or advertisements you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our Platform and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our Platform, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement. Other examples include HTML 5 cookies, Silverlight Application Storage, device fingerprints and "flash cookies".
We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. We may adopt a DNT standard if one is established. In the meantime, you may opt out of certain types of tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing your cookie settings.
We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat and Anti-Fraud technologies in our Platforms that utilize the same cookies and similar mechanisms. These technologies are described below.
B.Analytics Technologies
We use our own game servers and internal and third-party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our Platforms, your computer or device and the health of our Platforms.
For instance, TGMedia may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our Platforms. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in Section 3, below. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to TGMedia when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online Services, TGMedia also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other Users.
Third party analytics services integrated into our Platform may combine the information they collect in connection with TGMedia's Services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses Cookies to serve advertisements to Users on our Platforms, Website, and the Apps. Google uses first-party Cookies, such as Google Analytics Cookies, to compile data regarding User interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our Platforms, Website, and the Apps. We currently use Google Analytics to collect and process certain Website, Platforms and the Apps usage data. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out, please visit https://policies.google.com/privacy/google-partners. 
We have implemented advertising features on our Website, Apps, and Platforms including Googleâ€™s "DoubleClick" platform integration. We use these Cookies to compile data regarding User interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our Website. 
C.Ad Serving Technologies
Our Platform employs ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar products on third party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.
These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:
 - advertisements served and the location of such advertisement;
 - length of time an advertisement was visible;
 - domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and
 - advertisement response.
Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an advertisement to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
Note that opting out does not mean you won't see advertisements; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.
D.   Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies
TGMedia strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all the Users. When you log in to our Platform, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes. We also may use other anti-cheat technology on our Platforms.

However, in the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law.
We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity.

Our Website, Apps, and Platform are not meant for use by children under the age of 13. 
When Users identify themselves as children (i.e. under the age of 13 or under the minimum age in the relevant territory), consistent with applicable law we will: (1) not provide a path for them to input Personal Information, (2) collect certain information for limited purposes only (consistent with applicable law), (3) block or restrict the child from accessing relevant services (such as chat functionality); and/or (4) obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of their children's Personal Information.
