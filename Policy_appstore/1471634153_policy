Providing this data is voluntary, but necessary to establish contact. In this case, your data is processed for the purpose of contacting you, and the basis for processing is legitimate interest. The legal basis for processing after the end of contact is also a justified interest in the archiving of correspondence for the purpose of ensuring the possibility of demonstrating certain facts in the future.
