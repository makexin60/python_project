PRIVACY NOTICE
Shopbop Privacy Notice
Last Updated
: July 3, 2024.
We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. BOP, LLC and its affiliates ("Shopbop") are subsidiaries of Amazon.com, Inc. The collection and processing of your personal information through Shopbop.com and any related services (together, the “Services”) are subject to the
Amazon.com Privacy Notice
(the “Amazon Notice”), except as stated in this Shopbop Privacy Notice. By visiting or using Shopbop.com related Services, you are accepting the practices described in the Amazon Notice (as supplemented and modified by this Shopbop Privacy Notice) (together, the “Shopbop Privacy Notice”).
E-mail
By providing Shopbop your e-mail address, you consent to us sending you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your e-mail address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features, or special offers (“Other Messages”). If you do not want to receive Other Messages, you may opt out by changing your e-mail preference settings in the “Email Preferences” section of Shopbop.com after you have signed in using your personal password. Opting out may prevent you from receiving e-mail messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.
Cookies and Other Identifiers
To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve the Service, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our
Cookies Notice
.
Advertising
Shopbop provides ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Shopbop ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, we may use cookie identifiers to serve an ad that displays a product you viewed on site. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices

Additional State-Specific Privacy Disclosures
Last Updated
: July 3, 2024.
This additional state-specific privacy disclosure page (“Disclosure”) supplements the
Shopbop Privacy Notice
and is effective as of July 3, 2024. The
Shopbop Privacy Notice
describes the personal information that we collect, the sources from which we collect it, the purposes for which we use it, the limited circumstances under which we share personal information, and with whom we share it. These additional disclosures are required by certain state privacy laws, and provide a Notice at Collection under the California Privacy Rights Act:
Categories of personal information collected.
The personal information that Shopbop collects, or has collected from consumers in the twelve months prior to the effective date above, fall into the following categories established by the California Privacy Rights Act and other state privacy laws, depending on which Shopbop Service is used:
identifiers such as your name, alias/nickname, address, phone numbers, device ID, IP address, your Shopbop account log-in information or your Amazon account log-in information;
personal information, such as a credit card number or other payment information;
information that may reveal age, gender or gender identity, race, sexual orientation, or other protected classifications, for example if you choose to provide such information as part of a survey;
commercial information, such as purchase activity;
internet or other electronic network activity information, including content interaction information, such as clicks and scroll depth, or information used to prevent and detect fraud or other unauthorized activity, including informing customers if such activity were to affect them; geolocation data, such as the location of your device or computer;
professional information, for example data you may provide about your business if you are a Vendor;
audio information, such as voice recordings when you call our Customer Service; and
inference data, such as information about your purchase preferences.
Categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose.
The personal information that Shopbop may have disclosed for a business purpose to the third parties identified in the “Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information” section of the Amazon Privacy Notice in the twelve months prior to the effective date of above falls into the following categories established by the California Privacy Rights Act and other state privacy laws, depending on which Shopbop Service is used:
identifiers such as your name, address, or phone numbers, for example if we use a third-party carrier to deliver your order or if we use a third-party service to verify your identity;
personal information, such as a credit card number, or other payment information, for example if we use a third-party payment processor;
information that may reveal age, gender or gender identity, race, sexual orientation, or other protected classifications, for example if you choose to participate in a survey distributed by a survey provider;
commercial information, such as the details of a product or service you purchased if a third-party service provider assists in providing that product or service to you;
geolocation data;
internet or other electronic network activity information, such as if we use a service provider to help us gather crash reports for analyzing the health of our devices and services, or information relating to our prevention and detection of fraud or other unauthorized activity, which may require disclosing certain information about potentially affected customers to law enforcement; and
audio information, for example if a service provider reviews recordings of customer service phone calls for quality assurance purposes.
Advertising.
Shopbop shares limited information to help ensure you receive more useful and relevant Shopbop ads and to measure their effectiveness. Any personal information Shopbop may have shared for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, as that term is defined by the California Privacy Rights Act, in the twelve months prior to the effective date above falls into the following categories:
identifiers such as a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address; we do not share your name or other information that directly identifies you with ad companies.
internet or other electronic network activity information, such as whether you downloaded an app or other measures of ad effectiveness; for example, if you have already downloaded our app, we will share an advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again.
The categories of third parties with whom Shopbop may share personal information for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising are identified in the Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?" section of the Amazon Privacy Notice and the “Advertising" section of the Shopbop Privacy Notice. Shopbop also processes personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising as that term is defined under certain state privacy laws.
Children and Teens:
Shopbop does not sell children’s products, but allows children or teens to use Shopbop services with parental involvement. These services may collect data from children and teens who use them, and that data may be disclosed in a limited set of circumstances, such as if we use a service provider to help us gather crash reports for analyzing the health of our devices and services. We do not knowingly serve cross-context behavioral ads to children, or to teens under 18 years old.
Your Data Rights:
You may have certain data rights under state privacy laws, including to request information about the collection of your personal information by Shopbop, to access your personal information in a portable format, and to correct or delete your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact Customer Service or email us at
privacy@shopbop.com
.
Additionally, you may have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for cross-context behavioral advertising( also referred to as targeted advertising under certain state privacy laws). To do so, please visit
Your Ads Privacy Choices
, where you can opt out of cross-context behavioral advertising. You can also enable the Global Privacy Control (GPC) on your browser to opt out of cross-context behavioral ads.
You may have the right to appeal the denial of any of these rights by submitting a form that will be provided to you if we deny a data request. Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable.
To ensure the security of your Shopbop account, we will generally ask you to verify your request using the contact information you have already provided. If you do not have an account, or if you are an authorized agent under applicable state law, please contact Customer Service or email us at
privacy@shopbop.com
.
No sale of personal information.
In the twelve months prior to the effective date of this Disclosure, Shopbop has not sold any personal information of consumers, as those terms are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act.
De-identified Data Disclosure.
Shopbop may use de-identified data in some instances. Shopbop either maintains such data without attempting to re-identify it or treats such data as personal data subject to applicable law.
California Privacy Rights Act Sensitive Personal Information Disclosure.
The categories of data that Shopbop collects and discloses for a business purpose include “sensitive personal information” as defined under the California Privacy Rights Act. Shopbop does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose not expressly permitted by the California Privacy Rights Act.
California Privacy Rights Act Retention Disclosure.
To enable your continued use of the Services, we keep your personal information for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in the
Shopbop Privacy Notice
, as permitted or as may be required by law, or as otherwise communicated to you. For example, we retain your transaction history so that you can review past purchases (and repeat orders, if desired) and what addresses you have shipped orders to, and to improve the relevance of products and content we recommend.
California Privacy Rights Act Non-discrimination Statement.
Shopbop will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their rights under the California Privacy Rights Act.
Colorado Privacy Act and Oregon Consumer Privacy Act Profiling Disclosure.
Shopbop does not engage in profiling of consumers in furtherance of automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, as those terms are defined under the Colorado Privacy Act or the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act.
Oregon Consumer Privacy Act Controller Entity Disclosure.
The controller entities that are subject to the Shopbop Privacy Notice and this Disclosure include BOP LLC and Shopbop Mobile LLC.

Cookies Notice
We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively, "cookies") to recognize your browser or device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for additional purposes, including:
Recognizing you when you sign-in to use our services. This allows us to provide you with product recommendations, display personalized content, and provide other customized features and services.
Keeping track of your specified preferences. This allows us to honor your preferences, such as whether or not you would like to see interest-based ads (such as cross-context behavioral ads). You may set your preferences through your “My Account” page and the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
Keeping track of items stored in your shopping basket.
Conducting research and diagnostics to improve Shopbop’s content, products, and services.
Preventing fraudulent activity.
Improving security.
Delivering content, including ads, relevant to your interests on third-party sites (see the
Interest-Based Ads
notice for how we use cookies in serving interest-based ads).
Reporting. This allows us to measure and analyze the performance of our services.
Shopbop’s cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Shopbop’s essential features. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Shopbop products and services that require you to sign in.
Approved third parties may also set cookies when you interact with Shopbop services. Third parties include search engines, providers of measurement and analytics services, social media networks and advertising companies. Third parties use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform services on behalf of Shopbop.
You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings. The 'Help' feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to block cookies, and when cookies will expire. If you block all cookies on your browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may not work.
Shopbop Interest-Based Ads Notice
Interest-Based Ads
Interest-based ads are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads. We show interest-based ads to display features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations).
What sort of information do we use to show interest-based ads?
To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with our sites, content, or services. We do not use information which on its own identifies you, such as name or e-mail address, to serve interest-based ads.
As is common in the advertising industry, we use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively, “cookies”), which enable us to understand the effectiveness of the interest-based ads we show you by measuring what ads are clicked or viewed, and to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads are shown to your browser we can be careful not to show the same ads repeatedly.
See our
Privacy Notice
for more information about the types of information that we gather.
How do we work with third parties to show you interest-based ads?
We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve. In providing you interest-based ads we do not associate your interactions on unaffiliated sites with information which on its own identifies you, such as name or email address, and we do not provide any such information to advertisers or to third-party sites that display our interest-based ads. Advertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who purchased or browsed for classical music). Some third-parties may provide us pseudonymized information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.
Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads, directly to your browser or device, and they may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of Shopbop. For information on how to control and delete cookies (including third party cookies) please visit our
Cookies Notice
.
Advertising Preferences
Shopbop serves interest-based ads through third party ad networks. Shopbop offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from Shopbop by opting out of Cross-Context Behavioral Ads. You will still see ads but they will not be based on your interests. Please visit the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page to learn how to set your preferences. You can also generally opt out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.

Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not
            in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share
            customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com,
            Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at
            least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by
                  third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products
                  from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application
                  providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services.
                  We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses,
                  such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
                  transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions
                  with that third party.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                  include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal
                  mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
                  providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                  listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing
                  and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service
                  providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
                  may not use it for other purposes.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services.
                  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
                  assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice
                  (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event
                  that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
                  will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Amazon and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate
                  to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
Conditions of Use
and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users,
                  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
                  for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about
            you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose
            not to share the information.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.
We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by
                  using encryption protocols and software.
We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling
                  credit card data.
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the
                  collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security
                  procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal
                  information to you.
Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and
                  loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs.
                  Click
here
for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and
                  to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password
                  for your Amazon account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign
                  off when finished using a shared computer. Click

What About Advertising?
Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:
Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and
                  apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you
                  interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about
                  third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our
Interest-Based Ads
notice. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:
We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more
                  useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share
                  your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead,
                  we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived
                  from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
                  For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                  identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
                  the app again. While we do not share your specific shopping actions like purchases,
                  product views, or searches with ad companies, we may share an advertising identifier
                  and an estimate of the value of the ads they show you on our behalf so they can serve
                  you with more effective Amazon ads. Some ad companies also use this information to
                  serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out
                  of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going
                  to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
What Information Can I Access?
You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile
            information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the "Your
            Account" section of the website. Click
here
for a list of examples that you can access.
What Choices Do I Have?
If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information,
            please contact our
Customer Service
. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options
            as to how your information is being used.
As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information, but then you
                  might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.

                  settings in the app or device.

The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser
                  or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser
                  notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because
                  cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of
                  Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you
                  block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping
                  Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more

                  (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls
                  are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change
                  your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you
                  contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.
If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in
Seller Central
, update your account information by accessing your
Seller Account Information

Notification Preferences

            access to or delete your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things,

PRIVACY NOTICE
Shopbop Privacy Notice
Last Updated
: July 3, 2024.
We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. BOP, LLC and its affiliates ("Shopbop") are subsidiaries of Amazon.com, Inc. The collection and processing of your personal information through Shopbop.com and any related services (together, the “Services”) are subject to the
Amazon.com Privacy Notice
(the “Amazon Notice”), except as stated in this Shopbop Privacy Notice. By visiting or using Shopbop.com related Services, you are accepting the practices described in the Amazon Notice (as supplemented and modified by this Shopbop Privacy Notice) (together, the “Shopbop Privacy Notice”).
E-mail
By providing Shopbop your e-mail address, you consent to us sending you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your e-mail address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features, or special offers (“Other Messages”). If you do not want to receive Other Messages, you may opt out by changing your e-mail preference settings in the “Email Preferences” section of Shopbop.com after you have signed in using your personal password. Opting out may prevent you from receiving e-mail messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve the Service, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our
Cookies Notice
.
Advertising
Shopbop provides ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Shopbop ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, we may use cookie identifiers to serve an ad that displays a product you viewed on site. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices

Additional State-Specific Privacy Disclosures
Last Updated
: July 3, 2024.
This additional state-specific privacy disclosure page (“Disclosure”) supplements the
Shopbop Privacy Notice
and is effective as of July 3, 2024. The
Shopbop Privacy Notice
describes the personal information that we collect, the sources from which we collect it, the purposes for which we use it, the limited circumstances under which we share personal information, and with whom we share it. These additional disclosures are required by certain state privacy laws, and provide a Notice at Collection under the California Privacy Rights Act:
Categories of personal information collected.
The personal information that Shopbop collects, or has collected from consumers in the twelve months prior to the effective date above, fall into the following categories established by the California Privacy Rights Act and other state privacy laws, depending on which Shopbop Service is used:
identifiers such as your name, alias/nickname, address, phone numbers, device ID, IP address, your Shopbop account log-in information or your Amazon account log-in information;
personal information, such as a credit card number or other payment information;
information that may reveal age, gender or gender identity, race, sexual orientation, or other protected classifications, for example if you choose to provide such information as part of a survey;
commercial information, such as purchase activity;
internet or other electronic network activity information, including content interaction information, such as clicks and scroll depth, or information used to prevent and detect fraud or other unauthorized activity, including informing customers if such activity were to affect them; geolocation data, such as the location of your device or computer;
professional information, for example data you may provide about your business if you are a Vendor;
audio information, such as voice recordings when you call our Customer Service; and
inference data, such as information about your purchase preferences.
Categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose.
The personal information that Shopbop may have disclosed for a business purpose to the third parties identified in the “Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information” section of the Amazon Privacy Notice in the twelve months prior to the effective date of above falls into the following categories established by the California Privacy Rights Act and other state privacy laws, depending on which Shopbop Service is used:
identifiers such as your name, address, or phone numbers, for example if we use a third-party carrier to deliver your order or if we use a third-party service to verify your identity;
personal information, such as a credit card number, or other payment information, for example if we use a third-party payment processor;
information that may reveal age, gender or gender identity, race, sexual orientation, or other protected classifications, for example if you choose to participate in a survey distributed by a survey provider;
commercial information, such as the details of a product or service you purchased if a third-party service provider assists in providing that product or service to you;
geolocation data;
internet or other electronic network activity information, such as if we use a service provider to help us gather crash reports for analyzing the health of our devices and services, or information relating to our prevention and detection of fraud or other unauthorized activity, which may require disclosing certain information about potentially affected customers to law enforcement; and
audio information, for example if a service provider reviews recordings of customer service phone calls for quality assurance purposes.
Advertising.
Shopbop shares limited information to help ensure you receive more useful and relevant Shopbop ads and to measure their effectiveness. Any personal information Shopbop may have shared for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, as that term is defined by the California Privacy Rights Act, in the twelve months prior to the effective date above falls into the following categories:
identifiers such as a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address; we do not share your name or other information that directly identifies you with ad companies.
internet or other electronic network activity information, such as whether you downloaded an app or other measures of ad effectiveness; for example, if you have already downloaded our app, we will share an advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again.
The categories of third parties with whom Shopbop may share personal information for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising are identified in the Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?" section of the Amazon Privacy Notice and the “Advertising" section of the Shopbop Privacy Notice. Shopbop also processes personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising as that term is defined under certain state privacy laws.
Children and Teens:
Shopbop does not sell children’s products, but allows children or teens to use Shopbop services with parental involvement. These services may collect data from children and teens who use them, and that data may be disclosed in a limited set of circumstances, such as if we use a service provider to help us gather crash reports for analyzing the health of our devices and services. We do not knowingly serve cross-context behavioral ads to children, or to teens under 18 years old.
Your Data Rights:
You may have certain data rights under state privacy laws, including to request information about the collection of your personal information by Shopbop, to access your personal information in a portable format, and to correct or delete your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact Customer Service or email us at
privacy@shopbop.com
.
Additionally, you may have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for cross-context behavioral advertising( also referred to as targeted advertising under certain state privacy laws). To do so, please visit
Your Ads Privacy Choices
, where you can opt out of cross-context behavioral advertising. You can also enable the Global Privacy Control (GPC) on your browser to opt out of cross-context behavioral ads.
You may have the right to appeal the denial of any of these rights by submitting a form that will be provided to you if we deny a data request. Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable.
To ensure the security of your Shopbop account, we will generally ask you to verify your request using the contact information you have already provided. If you do not have an account, or if you are an authorized agent under applicable state law, please contact Customer Service or email us at
privacy@shopbop.com
.

In the twelve months prior to the effective date of this Disclosure, Shopbop has not sold any personal information of consumers, as those terms are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act.

California Privacy Rights Act Sensitive Personal Information Disclosure.
The categories of data that Shopbop collects and discloses for a business purpose include “sensitive personal information” as defined under the California Privacy Rights Act. Shopbop does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose not expressly permitted by the California Privacy Rights Act.
California Privacy Rights Act Retention Disclosure.
To enable your continued use of the Services, we keep your personal information for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in the
Shopbop Privacy Notice
, as permitted or as may be required by law, or as otherwise communicated to you.

California Privacy Rights Act Non-discrimination Statement.
Shopbop will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their rights under the California Privacy Rights Act.
Colorado Privacy Act and Oregon Consumer Privacy Act Profiling Disclosure.
Shopbop does not engage in profiling of consumers in furtherance of automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, as those terms are defined under the Colorado Privacy Act or the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act.

Cookies Notice
We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively, "cookies") to recognize your browser or device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for additional purposes, including:
Recognizing you when you sign-in to use our services. This allows us to provide you with product recommendations, display personalized content, and provide other customized features and services.
Keeping track of your specified preferences. This allows us to honor your preferences, such as whether or not you would like to see interest-based ads (such as cross-context behavioral ads). You may set your preferences through your “My Account” page and the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
Keeping track of items stored in your shopping basket.
Conducting research and diagnostics to improve Shopbop’s content, products, and services.
Preventing fraudulent activity.
Improving security.
Delivering content, including ads, relevant to your interests on third-party sites (see the
Interest-Based Ads
notice for how we use cookies in serving interest-based ads).
Reporting. This allows us to measure and analyze the performance of our services.
Shopbop’s cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Shopbop’s essential features. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Shopbop products and services that require you to sign in.
Approved third parties may also set cookies when you interact with Shopbop services. Third parties include search engines, providers of measurement and analytics services, social media networks and advertising companies. Third parties use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform services on behalf of Shopbop.
You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings. The 'Help' feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to block cookies, and when cookies will expire. If you block all cookies on your browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may not work.
Shopbop Interest-Based Ads Notice
Interest-Based Ads
Interest-based ads are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads. We show interest-based ads to display features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations).
What sort of information do we use to show interest-based ads?
To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with our sites, content, or services. We do not use information which on its own identifies you, such as name or e-mail address, to serve interest-based ads.
As is common in the advertising industry, we use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively, “cookies”), which enable us to understand the effectiveness of the interest-based ads we show you by measuring what ads are clicked or viewed, and to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads are shown to your browser we can be careful not to show the same ads repeatedly.
See our
Privacy Notice
for more information about the types of information that we gather.
How do we work with third parties to show you interest-based ads?
We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve. In providing you interest-based ads we do not associate your interactions on unaffiliated sites with information which on its own identifies you, such as name or email address, and we do not provide any such information to advertisers or to third-party sites that display our interest-based ads. Advertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who purchased or browsed for classical music). Some third-parties may provide us pseudonymized information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.
Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads, directly to your browser or device, and they may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of Shopbop. For information on how to control and delete cookies (including third party cookies) please visit our
Cookies Notice
.
Advertising Preferences
Shopbop serves interest-based ads through third party ad networks. Shopbop offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from Shopbop by opting out of Cross-Context Behavioral Ads. You will still see ads but they will not be based on your interests. Please visit the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page to learn how to set your preferences. You can also generally opt out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.
