17.	Dispute Resolution
Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court. For purposes of this Section 12 (Dispute Resolution), “
Nespresso
” shall include its shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns.
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM OR ACTION, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR
Nespresso
WOULD HAVE IN COURT, SUCH AS APPELLATE REVIEW, ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
If you and
Nespresso
have a Dispute (defined below), you and
Nespresso
agree to make a good faith effort to resolve it informally prior to initiating a formal arbitration proceeding. If you or
Nespresso
intend to initiate an arbitration proceeding, the initiating party must first send a verified notice (“Notice”) to the responding party that describes the Dispute. The Notice must include the initiating party’s name and contact information (address, telephone number, and email address), sufficient information to enable the parties to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) the Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of the claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought, with a detailed calculation. If you have a Dispute with us, you must send this notice to USDisputeReso[@]us.nestle.com. If
Nespresso
has a Dispute with you,
Nespresso
will send this notice to the email associated with your
Nespresso
account or other email address you have provided to
Nespresso
. You and
Nespresso
will participate in an individual meet-and-confer in person or via teleconference or videoconference. The meet-and-confer will address only the Dispute between you and
Nespresso
. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the meet-and-confer, but you will still need to be present for the meet-and-confer.
Nespresso
will participate through one of its representatives, and its counsel may also be present.
If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you or
Nespresso
may commence a formal dispute resolution proceeding consistent with the process set forth below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. If a party commences an arbitration without providing Notice and completing the informal dispute resolution process, that party will be responsible for any filing fees or other costs incurred in connection with such arbitration. If the sufficiency of a Notice or compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it may be decided by a court at either party’s election, and any formal dispute resolution proceeding shall be stayed pending resolution of the issue. A court shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to arbitration, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration.
If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through the mandatory informal dispute resolution process, except as set forth below, all claims, controversies, or disputes between you and
Nespresso
will be resolved entirely through binding individual arbitration, rather than in court, including, without limitation, such claims, controversies, or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and
Nespresso
, your access or use of our Site or any products or services offered by or purchased from
Nespresso
, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory (“Dispute”). Dispute will be given the broadest possible meaning permitted by law. It includes claims that arose before this or any prior agreement or that arise after the termination of this agreement. The sole exceptions to the foregoing requirement to arbitrate are that: (1) either party may assert individual claims in small claims court if those claims otherwise qualify for small claims court and as long as the matter remains in such court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative basis); and (2) each party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (but claims not related to infringement or other misuses or intellectual property rights but jointly submitted with claims to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights will be resolved only in arbitration). This Dispute Resolution section evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute Resolution section. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this agreement. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, AND UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED, YOU AND
Nespresso
GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO BRING AND PROSECUTE ANY DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW OR BEFORE A JURY AND GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, no class actions, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, in favor or against only the parties to the arbitration and only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by the party’s individual claim, including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages. The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator must follow these Terms as a court would. The arbitrator may not consider any prior settlement offers in making the decision. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the parties to the arbitration and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals.
We agree that the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), adr.org. (If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer arbitrations consistent with this Dispute Resolution section, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will administer arbitrations consistent with this Dispute Resolution section. If the parties cannot agree on a provider, one shall be selected by the court and that provider will administer any arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution section.). To begin an arbitration proceeding, after satisfying the condition precedent identified above, you must (1) send a verified and personally signed demand for arbitration that describes (a) the nature and basis of your claims, and (b) the nature and basis of the relief sought, including a detailed calculation to: Dispute Resolution at USDisputeReso[@]us.nestle.com, and (2) contact the AAA and follow the appropriate procedures with the AAA to commence the arbitration.
Nespresso
must do the same to begin an arbitration proceeding, except that it will send the demand for arbitration to the email address associated with your
Nespresso
account or other email address you have provided to
Nespresso
. The AAA consumer rules for arbitration will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. Except as expressly provided in this Dispute Resolution section, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Dispute Resolution section including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's applicable consumer rules. The parties shall be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless they are authorized by law or the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith. Either party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to resolve a Dispute. If an arbitration decision or award is later issued that is less favorable than the last written offer of settlement that a party did not accept, then that party must pay all reasonable costs and fees—including arbitration fees—incurred by the offering party after the written settlement offer was made. The arbitration may be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location as set forth in the AAA rules. If requested, you shall personally appear (with your counsel if you have one) at an initial telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Nespresso
will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.
AS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE EACH AGREE TO BRING ANY DISPUTE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY, AND NOT ON A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim by any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration proceeding, and the arbitrator may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general proceeding. If a court determines that any of the prohibitions on non-individualized relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. You and
Nespresso
may participate in a classwide, collective, and/or representative settlement of claims. Specifically, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution), the arbitrator may not issue a "public injunction" and any such "public injunction," if permitted, may be awarded only by a federal or state court. If either party is permitted to seek a "public injunction," all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any such prayer or claim for a "public injunction" in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party's claim or prayer for "public injunctive relief." In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.
Special Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration: If twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against a party by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated, you and
Nespresso
understand and agree that the resolution of the Dispute might be delayed. You and
Nespresso
also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for
Nespresso
shall each select ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial twenty (20) proceedings, each side shall select another ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. A single arbitrator shall preside over each case. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise. This staged process shall continue, consistent with the parameters identified above, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this Dispute Resolution section from the time of the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected for a bellwether process, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands.
Future Changes to Dispute Resolution Section: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if
Nespresso
makes any future changes to this Dispute Resolution section (other than a change to the mailing or email address), you may reject any such change by sending
Nespresso
written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the address provided above. This is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Dispute Resolution section.
18.	Governing Law and Venue

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
Nespresso
USA supports the goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and strives to be examples of good human rights and labor practices throughout our business activities. The
Nestlé Corporate Business Principles
are at the basis of our company’s culture, which has developed over the span of 140 years. Since Henri Nestlé first developed his successful infant cereal “Farine Lactée”, we have built our business on the conviction that to have long-term success for our shareholders, we not only have to comply with all applicable legal requirements and ensure that all our activities are sustainable, but additionally we have to create significant value for society.
Nestlé’s actions in this area include the following:
1. Product Supply Chains / Suppliers
In The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé commits to foster responsible practices in our supply chain.
The Nestlé Supplier Code
, which is accepted by our suppliers, helps to implement this commitment and establishes non-negotiable minimum standards for Nestlé suppliers in the areas of Health and Safety, Labor Standards, Business Integrity, and the Environment.
Nestlé is also a member of Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), a not for profit membership organization dedicated to driving improvements in responsible and ethical business practices in global supply chains. Sedex is currently being used by a number of leading retailers and brand manufacturers and over 15,000 sites are registered on Sedex. More information can be found at
www.sedexglobal.com
.
Nestlé maintains a partnership with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), a non-profit multi-stakeholder initiative that works with major companies to improve working conditions in their supply chains. We invited the FLA to examine our cocoa supply from Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s largest exporter of cocoa, and their
report
was issued in June 2012. More information and Nestlé’s
action plan
in response to the report can be found at
www.nestle.com
.
2. Supplier Audits
Nestlé reserves the right to verify our Supplier’s compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code. Nestlé confirms compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code through either a combination of third party certifications or a Responsible Sourcing Audit conducted by a third party.
In the event that Nestlé becomes aware of any actions or conditions not in compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code, Nestlé reserves the right to demand corrective measures. Nestlé reserves the right to terminate an agreement with any supplier who does not comply with the Nestlé Supplier Code.
3. Human Rights in our business activities
As indicated in the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé fully supports the United Nations Global Compact’s (UNGC) guiding principles on human rights and labor, and aim to provide an example of good human rights’ and labor practices throughout our business activities.
4. Code of Business Conduct
Since the Company was founded, Nestlé’s business practices have been governed by integrity, honesty, fair dealing and full compliance with all applicable laws. Nestlé employees worldwide have upheld and lived this commitment in their everyday responsibilities ever since, and Nestlé’s reputation remains one of the Company’s most important assets today.
The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles
prescribe certain values and principles which Nestlé has committed to worldwide. This Code of Business Conduct specifies and helps the continued implementation of the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles by establishing certain nonnegotiable minimum standards of behavior in key areas.
5. Employee Training
The new version of The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles was provided to each of our 280,000 employees globally by the end of 2010 and accompanied by learning and training tools. Employees were asked to acknowledge that they had received and read The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles.
As of 2011, a modular training program was rolled out on the various components of the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles. The depth and focus of the trainings was established in accordance with the materiality for the different functions within the company.
The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles will continue to evolve and adapt to a changing world. Our basic foundation is unchanged from the time of the origins of the company, and reflects the basic ideas of fairness, honesty, and a general concern for people.
