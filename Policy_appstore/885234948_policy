Presentation
Thanks to this application (and the other Widget apps from PacoLabs), you can now customize the Home screen and the Today view of your device, by adding custom widgets for some specific purposes.
From anywhere in your device, you'll have access to your own information and actions.
Add various widgets for your different needs.
You can, for instance, add a calendar that will display the current month and the busy days.
You can add your favorite photos of your beloved family and friends.
You can add your horoscope, a photo of the day (from the internet), some audio notes, some world clocks and more...
The application contains some free widgets like the Note widget allowing you to quickly view and edit some text notes and reminders and the Decision widget allowing you to randomly choose one item among several choices.
Each other widget type can be tried and can be unlocked separately.
You can also unlock all the current and future widget types at once, if you are a widget addict !
Those Widgets are compatible with the new iOS 14 Home Screen Widgets.
The application is really easy to use and is adapted to the fresh look of your device.
Dark mode of iOS13  is supported.
In Today view:
You can add as many widgets as you want and they will be displayed in up to 3 different lists. Those same lists will be available in the Today view and in the application (although it is possible, if you want, to hide some widgets in the Today view).
To avoid overloading the Today view, when too many widgets are displayed, an intuitive control will allow you to navigate from one widget to another.
Even if the main purpose of the app is to view the widgets in the Today view, it can also be very handy to view them directly in the application (a long press on a widget in the Today view will open it directly in the main application).
