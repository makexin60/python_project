In some cases, we will de-identify or anonymize personal information for internal purposes, such as to identify trends, manage our business, develop statistical information, understand how we are performing, develop relevant products, services or offers, and manage business risks such as preventing and detecting fraud.
We use industry accepted best practices and methods for hashing, de-identification, and anonymization to prevent the intentional re-identification of the information.
When we de-identify or anonymize information we remove identifying information such as name, address, or data of birth. Once identifying information has been removed it is no longer personal information. This information may also be aggregated with other information. Anonymized information is not subject to this privacy policy.

Is my personal information disclosed to third parties?
In some cases, we might share your personal information with an approved third party vendor who we contract for a specific purpose, like customized in-app experiences, advertisements, or analytics. In those cases, your personal information is used by the third party only for the purpose it was collected and nothing else. Information is not shared with any third party for its own use.

How long will Rogers retain my personal information?
Rogers will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.

How can I deactivate/delete my App profile/account?
If you created a profile or account in one of our Apps, you may be able to deactivate or delete it. In some circumstances, however, this may not be possible. For example, there may be regulatory and legal obligations that require us to retain some information about you. In addition, if you have an active service account or owe a balance on your account, your information and App account cannot be deleted.
