At the core of Blinq's product is the enablement of sharing your information with those you want to share with. As a result, data privacy is critical to the product we offer. At Blinq, we believe in the importance of being able to control who gets that information.
To reflect this importance, we've designed our product with made several principles in mind that are intended to protect your data and privacy:
Your data is yours

Secure Storage
Your data is protected by Enterprise grade encryption and security.
Safe Sharing
Every Blinq Card has a unique code and web address. Those you share your information with will be able to look at your details. If they share your card with others or their company, others may be able to view your details.
‍
Introduction
This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how the personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you may provide in the Blinq software applications (“Software Applications” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”) is collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Blinq Technologies Pty Ltd (“Blinq Technologies Pty Ltd”, “we”, “us” or “our”, “Blinq”). Blinq is the company name of the operator of the Blinq Business Card Application (“Blinq”). By accessing and using the Software Applications and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
‍
Automatic collection of information
Our top priority is customer data security. We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Software Applications and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the Software Application and Services.
‍
Collection of personal information
You can access and use the Software Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features in the Software Applications, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and email address).

Such third party processors' use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy.

We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.
‍
Retention of information
We may hold your Personal Information in physical or digital form. In some cases, we may use a third party to store your information. In any event, we take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information we hold about you is kept confidential and secure.
We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information.
