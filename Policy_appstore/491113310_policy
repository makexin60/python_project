Privacy Policy Move the Box: Continents (Google Play) and Move the Box (Apple AppStore)
Google Play and Apple AppStore require developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information. We want to outline the way we handle information we receive about users in
Move the Box: Continents
app (Google Play) and
Move the Box
app (Apple AppStore). Both apps use the same codebase written in Unity, the following facts apply to both of them and we will only refer to TheGame, meaning either of two apps.
TheGame only collects and stores information obtained on the client device through third-party libraries. Our own code doesn't collect and/or store any information from the user outside of user's device.
Third party libraries included in TheGame that collect and/or store user information are parts of Unity or Google services.
Unity is a game development framework used to create
TheGame
. One can find privacy policy for Unity at
https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy
, in particular check the "I play a game built with Unity software, what should I know?" question.
Google services used for TheGame are Google Firebase and AdMob. One can find privacy policies in place for Google services in general at
https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
AdMob is a service we use to display ads in TheGame. One can find relevant policies on Google's side at
https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en
Firebase Analytics is a service that provides some aggregate information about users of TheGame. One can find relevant policies at
https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics
