本隐私政策适用于SW所提供的所有产品和服务。除本隐私政策外，我们可能还会针对不同的产品与服务提供仅适用于该特定产品的产品隐私说明。如果某款SW旗下的产品、服务有单独的产品隐私说明，则该产品的隐私说明将优先适用，产品隐私说明未涵盖的内容，以本隐私政策内容为准。本隐私政策将帮助您了解以下内容：

用户主动提供的非个人信息。在用户使用我们的产品与服务过程中，视功能需要用户也可能会向我们主动提供部分非个人信息。这些非个人信息一般无法识别你的个人身份。例如，在使用我们的翻译棒硬件产品时，您可能会向我们提交您的具体语音指令，以便我们能够识别解析用户的语音内容，向用户提供翻译服务，同时收集这些语音内容也会协助我们了解用户的发音习惯，提高翻译的准确度。
在使用产品与服务过程中我们会自动收集的信息
为了分析用户的使用习惯、改善用户体验和优化我们产品与服务的性能，我们会自动从您访问应用程序的手机、平台电脑以及其他设备（以下简称“设备”）收集某些日志、行为、设备信息以及诊断信息等。这些信息包括：网络日志信息。您使用我们的产品和服务时，我们可能通过WEB日志或某些程序软件（如软件开发工具包、像素、脚本或其他跟踪机制自动收集某些信息并存储在我们的服务器日志中）。此类信息可能包括：对产品和服务的详细使用情况，如您应用程序的打开时间、使用时长、访问的页面地址等；设备事件信息，例如崩溃、系统活动等信息；IP地址；您所在的时区等；您的设备信息。

设备属性：如您设备的品牌、型号、操作系统、分辨率、屏幕尺寸、蓝牙设定、因特网连接状态、已安装的应用程序列表、硬件和软件版本、电池电量、信号强度、可用存储空间、浏览器类型、应用和文件名称及类型以及插件等信息。
用户操作：有关用户在设备上执行的操作和行为的信息，例如窗口是设为当前还是后台运行等。
设备序列号或其他设备标识符：如国际移动设备身份码IMEI、网络设备硬件地址（如MAC地址）、广告标识符（如苹果设备中的IDFA）等设备序列号等；
设备信号：您使用设备的网络状态、蓝牙状态、WIFI接入点信息等；
位置信息：我们可能会使用GPS、WiFi或其他技术方式收集和处理有关您所在位置的信息。对于比较敏感的用户信息，如用户IMEI号、GPS位置信息，我们在收集之前会征得您的同意。对于一些非敏感信息的收集，则可能是默认和自动的。您可以通过调整移动设备的“设置”选项限制我们从您的移动设备收集相关信息或使用特定权限。当您限制我们获取某项权限后，可能会影响某项功能的运行，导致我们可能无法继续为您提供相对应的服务，也不再处理您相应的信息。
二、我们如何分享和披露您的信息
我们不会将您的个人信息出售给第三方，但可能会在以下情况下披露或分享您的个人数据：在获取您明确同意的情况下披露；
披露给我们特定员工、关联公司或附属公司的技术服务人员：我们可能会出于提供本产品与服务的目的需要将您的个人信息与其他信息与我们特定部门的员工、关联公司或附属公司的技术或其他工作人员共享。这些员工、关联公司或附属公司仅能存储其代表我们执行这些限定职务所需的信息。
披露给第三方合作伙伴：我们的某些服务功能由我们的第三方合作伙伴（如承包商、代理商、广告合作伙伴、应用开发者等）合作提供，所以我们可能会与合作伙伴共享您的某些个人数据，以向你正常提供服务或者实现其他用户协议中所载明的目的。我们仅会出于特定、明确而合法的目的处理您的个人数据，并且只会向第三方披露提供服务所必要的数据。我们会要求第三方合作伙伴按照本隐私说明的要求，并采取符合行业标准的安全措施保证处理你的个人信息数据的安全性，不会将您的个人数据用于任何其他与本服务无关的用途。
基于法律或维护您的重大利益的披露：在当适用的法律要求，或者回复司法机关传票、法院命令，或遵循其他执法机关的类似要求时，或为预防诈欺并保护我们自身、您、第三方或社会大众的财产或其他重大利益，我们酌情认为披露实属于紧迫、合理和必要时，我们可能会披露你的个人信息。
企业并购、分立、破产等。如果发生合并、收购、破产或其他出售本公司全部或部分资产的情况，我们所拥有或控制的任何您的信息可能也是转移给第三方的财产之一，我们保留将您的信息及我们从本服务收集的其他信息转移给第三方的权利。
我们可能会以特定的技术方式剥离您信息中的所有个人识别特征，与关联方、非关联方共享汇总的匿名化用户信息，用于与提供本产品与服务目的相关的分析和研究。

Right to object to processing. You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal basis of consent, contract or legitimate interests. We can continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.
Right to data portability. If we process your personal information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another “controller”, where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.
Notification to third-parties. If we share your personal information with third parties, we will notify them of any requests for rectification, erasure or restriction of your personal information, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.
Automated individual decision-making, including profiling. You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless an exception applies under applicable law.

E. Transfer of Personal Information
If you choose to use the Services or provide your information to us, your personal information may be transferred to, processed and maintained on servers or databases located outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located. Such countries or jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are less protective than the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located, you should not use the Services.
**Designated Countries: **We transfer your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards as permitted under the Data Protection Laws. Specifically, when your personal information is transferred out of the Designated Countries, we have the required contractual provisions for transferring personal information in place with the third-parties to which your information is transferred.  For such transfers, we rely on legal transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or we work with U.S. based third parties that are certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
