Privacy Policy
THE COOPLE SYSTEM AND INTRODUCTION TO THESE TERMS
Coople (UK) Limited (We, Our or Us) owns and/or controls the website at www.coople.com and related domains (the URL) and its Coople app (hereinafter “App”). We bring workers and client companies together via the URL and the App. The bringing together of workers with client companies in respect of work assignments is largely automated (Matching) (Matching and the URL hereinafter together referred to as the Website). We are registered in England and Wales with company number 9402285 and registered office at 2nd Floor, Classic House, 174-180 Old Street, EC1V 9BP. These terms and conditions relate to your use of the Website and the App.
The client companies are referred to in the
Service Terms
as “hirers”, and on the Website or the App as ‘company users’. This does not change the fact that workers (called “Cooplers” on the Website or the app) under the Service Terms will be engaged (but, for the avoidance of doubt, are not employed) by Us, which then seeks to obtain for workers suitable assignments with hirers.
The use of the Website or the App is free for workers and hirers.
By accessing the Website or the App, you confirm that you accept these terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to these terms, please refrain from using the Website or the App.

We process some sensitive personal data about you, such as details about your nationality, physical and mental health and information regarding the commission or alleged commission by you of any offence.
For further detail of how we use your information, please see our Privacy Policy below.

B4 DISCLOSURES TO THIRD PARTIES AND JUSTIFICATION OF USES
B.4.1 Where you are a worker and have been matched to a hirer, We will provide the hirer with your personal information including your identity and suitability for the role for the purposes of providing you with work. The hirer will be a data controller in its own right and shall ensure it processes any personal information relating to a worker in accordance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations. We shall not be liable for the acts and omissions of the hirer in respect of their processing of such personal information. Workers should review any hirers’ privacy policies to understand the ways in which hirers will process personal information. Where you are the designated contact of a hirer which has been matched to a worker, We will provide the worker with your personal information such as your identity and contact information. We may also permit selected third parties and agents to use your personal information, solely for the purposes set out in paragraph 2 above, who will be subject to obligations to process such information in compliance with the same safeguards that We deploy. This includes our group companies, cloud service providers and sub-contractors which We use for the operation of our services. A list of such third parties and agents can be reviewed on our website or the App.
Use justification: contract performance, legal obligation, legitimate interests (to enable Us to provide our services).
B.4.2 In the event that We (or a part thereof) are (i) subject to negotiations for the sale of its business or (ii) is sold to a third party or (iii) undergoes a reorganisation, you agree that any of your personal information which We hold may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party and used for the same purposes as set out in this policy or for the purpose of analysing any proposed sale or re-organisation. We will ensure that no more of your information is transferred than necessary.
Use justification: legal obligation, legal claims, legitimate interests (to cooperate with law enforcement and regulatory authorities).
B.4.3 We may disclose your personal information to third parties, the court service and/or regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with proceedings or investigations anywhere in the world where compelled to do so.

B5 TRANSMISSION, STORAGE AND SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Security over the internet
B.5.1 No data transmission over the Internet, the Website or the App can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, We maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.
B.5.2 All information you provide to Us is stored on our or our subcontractors/business partners (only as necessary for Us to perform our services and in accordance with B4 above) secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. Where We have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site and/or the App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that We notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Export outside the EEA
B.5.3 Your personal information may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EEA. Regardless of location or whether the person is an employee or contractor, We will impose the same data protection safeguards that We deploy inside the EEA.
Certain countries outside the EEA, such as Switzerland where our parent company is registered, have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals, We will either ask for your consent to the transfer or transfer it subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient unless we are permitted under applicable data protection law to make such transfers without such formalities.
Please contact Us as set out in paragraph B.6.5 below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal information.
Storage limits
B.5.4 We will retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose for which it was collected and store it for 6 years after you stop using Our services, or for any other permitted linked purpose (for example, certain transaction details and correspondence may be retained until the time limit for claims in respect of the transaction has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data). So if information is used for two purposes We will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires; but We will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period when that period expires.
We restrict access to your personal information to those persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose(s). Our retention periods are based on business needs and your information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymised (and the anonymised information may be retained) or securely destroyed.
B6 YOUR RIGHTS & CONTACTING US
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2017/679 you have the following rights in relation to your personal data. All of these rights can be exercised by contacting us at info@coople.com. Whilst We encourage our customers to engage with Us in the event they have any concerns or complaints, you have the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority such as the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK (see www.ico.org.uk).
Marketing
B.6.1 You have the right to ask Us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will inform you if We intend to use your data for such purposes or if We intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms We use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting Us as set out in paragraph 5.6.5 below or by un-checking the relevant boxes on your user profile setting page on the Website or change the notification settings in the App.
Right of Access:
B.6.2 You have the right to request that We provide you with a copy of your personal data free of charge. Whilst your account is active, you have access to all of your profile data which can be accessed at any time. The first copy you request of the personal data undergoing processing will be provided free of charge, but We may charge you an administration fee for any further copies. Repeated, excessive or manifestly unfounded requests will be subject to a reasonable fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the personal information We hold about you, or we may refuse to act on such requests.
Right of Rectification:
B.6.3 We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your personal information is accurate. In order to assist Us with this, you should notify Us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to Us by updating your details on your user profile settings page on the Website or the App.
Right to Erasure:
B.6.4 You have the right to ask us to delete all of your personal data in certain situations, for example where processing is based solely on consent and We have no other legal ground for such processing. You can deactivate your profile at any time either via the Application or via our support desk.
Right to Restrict Processing:
B.6.5 You have the right to ask us to restrict processing of your personal data in certain situations, for example during the period where We are verifying the accuracy of your personal data.
Right to Data Portability:
B.6.6 You have the right to receive your personal data which you have provided to Us in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and have the right to transmit such data to another data controller in certain circumstances and where technically feasible. You can access all the profile information provided by you via the Application and download such information in [csv file format].
B.6.7 Asking us to stop processing your personal data or deleting your personal data will likely mean that you are no longer able to use Our services, or at least those aspects of Our services which require the processing of the types of personal data you have asked us to delete. This may lead to you being unable to seek work using Our services.
B.6.8 Where you request We rectify or erase your personal data or restrict any processing of such personal data, We may notify third parties to whom such personal data has been disclosed of such request. However, such third party may have the right to retain and continue to process such personal data in its own right, for example, any hirers which have received your personal data may need to retain it on lawful grounds without your consent.
