The ABC is committed to protecting your privacy by creating a safe and secure space for you to enjoy all ABC services, including our programs, websites, and apps. This Privacy Policy explains how and why we collect and use information about you, including:
what types of information we collect
how it is collected and used
how we keep your information safe
when and why we might share that information outside of the ABC
your choices about your information
The ABC collects and uses personal information so we can provide ABC content and services that inform, educate, and entertain and ensure they reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community.  Find out more about personal information by reading the FAQ,
What is Personal Information?
The ABC does not commercialise data. If we are required to disclose information, including your personal information, to help us provide services to you, we do not receive any sort of payment for doing this.
Children’s privacy is especially important – both protecting it and helping children, parents and guardians understand privacy risks.  You can
share this video
with children to help them understand privacy better.
Information we collect to make programs and produce other content is not covered by this Privacy Policy. The
ABC Editorial Policies
and the
ABC Code of Practice
explain how we approach privacy in relation to journalism.
To find out more about anything in this Privacy Policy, head to
Privacy at the ABC
where you will find FAQs with detailed information, including how to contact the
ABC Privacy Officer
.
1. Why does the ABC collect personal information?
The ABC collects information about you to deliver and improve the content and services the ABC provides.  This includes information about how you use our services.  By gaining a better understanding of what our audiences do and do not like, we can make sure our programs are relevant for all Australians. Collection of this information also helps us create a better experience for you, where you can easily discover and access content.
2. What personal information does the ABC collect?
There are different types of information we collect depending on the circumstances.  This information is either collected directly from you or is provided to us on your behalf by someone else. For example, if a parent or carer creates an ABC iview profile for you.
a) Signing up for an ABC Account
When you sign up for an ABC Account, we collect:
login details (like an email address and password)
first or preferred name
year of birth
postcode
gender identity (optional)
We collect this information so we can understand how to better serve our audiences. If you sign up using social media sign-on (such as Facebook, Google or Apple), we might receive other information about your account details, like your profile picture.  As with all personal information held by the ABC, this information is protected in accordance with ABC cyber security practices (see section 3 below).
b) Sensitive information
We might ask for sensitive information about you (like your ethnicity, political views, religious beliefs, physical and mental health, etc.), but only when it is necessary and relevant.
For example, if you are participating in audience research, this will ensure a more representative study sample.
Sensitive information is not shared outside the ABC. We will always ask for your consent when we request sensitive information, and you do not need to provide any sensitive information when you sign up for an ABC Account or to access ABC content or services.
c) Location
We might collect your location information so we can show you relevant local content. For example, you can enter your postcode on the ABC News website to receive local news and weather updates.
d) Entering a competition
We might ask for your name, contact details, and date of birth when you enter a competition, for example, to make sure you are eligible to enter an age restricted competition or so that we can contact you if you win.
e) Payment information
We collect payment information when you buy something from the ABC Merch Store or the triple j store.  This information is only used to process your payment.
If you use an online purchase service such as Shopify to complete your transaction, your personal information (including credit card information) will be collected and used by that service.
f) Device and browser information
Devices can be anything you use to access ABC content over the internet, like a smart TV, gaming console, mobile phone, tablet, or laptop.  A browser is an application for accessing websites.
We automatically collect some information from your device and browser to make sure our websites and apps run smoothly, and to help us provide technical support, and for analytics.
If you are logged in to an ABC Account at the time, we might link your device and browser information to your ABC Account.
You can find out more by visiting
Privacy at the ABC
.
g) Cookies and Other Technologies
We collect information about how you use ABC websites and apps using cookies, beacons, and local storage.
This helps us make sure the ABC websites and apps you are using work well.  For example, some cookies are used to remember your preferences.
For more information about how cookies and other online tools work, visit
Privacy at the ABC.
3. How does the ABC keep my personal information safe?
The ABC is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
The ABC’s cyber security practices are aligned with the cyber security principles and guidelines outlined in the Australian Commonwealth Government ‘Information Security Manual’ (ISM). We also have dedicated teams that look after the privacy and security of personal information held by the ABC.
Our cybersecurity team stays across the latest developments in online security and works with experts in online safety.
We restrict access to your data within the ABC to keep it safe.
ABC staff are trained in cyber security and practices that help keep your personal information safe and secure, including how to identify and respond to threats.
4. Why does the ABC share my personal information with others?
The ABC does not sell or share your personal information for commercial gain. But sometimes we do need to share information, which might include your personal information, with others.
The ABC partners with carefully selected organisations to help us safely collect, store, and manage your personal information.
This means we might share your information with those organisations so we can do things like:
send you the ABC Newsletters you subscribe to
show you recommended programs on ABC iview
create your ABC Account
a) To deliver a personalised experience
Personalisation has become an important part of how the world enjoys online content.
This means when you use ABC websites and apps, you might be shown some content that is relevant to your interests.
For example, the
Recommended
For You
rail on ABC iview helps you discover new programs.
We can do this by understanding what you watch, read and listen to on ABC websites and apps.
We might then combine this information with other information you provide when signing up for an ABC Account, subscribing to ABC Newsletters, or creating profiles on ABC iview, such as your age or location.
We use this to help you discover programs you might like. More details can be found in the FAQ,
What are Personalised Recommendations?
If you have an ABC Account, you can
opt-out of receiving personalised recommendations
by accessing your
ABC Account settings
.
b) To help us monitor and improve ABC programs, websites, and apps
We might share some information, including how ABC websites and apps are used, and information about devices used to access ABC services with our analytics and ratings service providers.
For more details on our analytics and ratings service providers, visit
Privacy at the ABC
.
c) To show you relevant promotions on ABC and non-ABC websites and apps
We use device IDs, hashed email addresses and other online tools to show you relevant promotions for ABC content on other websites and apps you might be using.
This could be a sponsored post on Instagram or Facebook for triple j’s
Like A Version
, or a promotion for the latest episode of a drama program when you’re browsing Google.
For more information about how cookies and other online tools work, visit
Privacy at the ABC.
For more information on hashed email address sharing read the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
i. device ID
We will only share your device ID with Google or Meta with your permission.  We share this information so that if you use those platforms, we can show you ABC promotions that you are more likely to be interested in.
We will always ask for your permission before we do this, and you can easily opt-out by
managing your device ID settings
.
ii. hashed email address sharing
If you are signed up for an ABC Account, a hashed version of your email address may be shared with Google and Meta.  We do this so that if you use those platforms, we can show you ABC promotions that you are more likely to be interested in, as well as measure and improve ABC promotional campaigns.
If you are not comfortable with this, you can opt-out by managing your
ABC Account settings
.
Learn more by reading the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
iii. IP address
We may share your IP address with third parties to help us measure and improve ABC promotional campaigns.
If you are an ABC Account holder, you can opt-out by managing your
ABC Account settings
.
Learn more by reading the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
5. Additional privacy terms
Some ABC content and services are offered using non-ABC websites and apps.
For example, the triple j app allows you to send a playlist to YouTube Music. The YouTube Terms of Service are available
here
.
You should read the privacy policy and terms and conditions of each service carefully before deciding whether to accept them.
In addition, if the ABC embeds posts, photos or videos from third parties, such as Facebook or YouTube, those third parties may use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies in relation to that content. If you then “share” that content, the service you have chosen to share content through may also use these technologies.
For more information about how cookies and other online tools work, visit
Privacy at the ABC.
You should also only post information online if you are happy for it to be publicly available.
6. Is my personal information sent overseas?
Some companies we partner have storage locations in Australia while others are outside Australia, including but not limited to Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK, and the USA.
We only disclose personal information to overseas recipients if we are satisfied that our service providers have appropriate controls to protect your personal information and that they only use your personal information for purposes we authorise.
7. How does the ABC protect younger children and teenagers?
The ABC is committed to creating a safe and secure space for young people to enjoy their favourite ABC programs and other content.
We provide services like ABC Kids for pre-school children, and ABC Big Kids for primary school-aged children. These services provide ABC programming that is appropriate for young people. When a profile is created for a child on ABC iview, we make sure the content available to them is suitable for their age. In a child’s profile, only ABC Kids is accessible to younger children up to 6 years old, unless their parent or guardian enables them to also have access to ABC Big Kids. Older children get access to both ABC Kids and ABC Big Kids.
However, we strongly encourage parents and carers to monitor and participate in their children’s use of ABC websites and apps.
For more information, visit
Protecting Families and Children
.
8. Will my child’s personal information be used for marketing purposes?
No, the use of device IDs for promotional purposes, and the use of any personal information for measuring ABC promotions is disabled in:
children’s ABC Accounts
ABC iview children’s profiles created under adult ABC Accounts
ABC Kids and ABC Big Kids website and app
In addition, children’s ABC Accounts are automatically opted-out of hashed email address sharing. Learn more by reading the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
9. Can I contact the ABC about privacy issues?
Yes, we welcome any feedback you might have about privacy-related issues.
You also have the right to request access to, or seek the correction of any personal information we might have about you. Deletion requests are subject to the ABC's record-keeping obligations, including the
Archives Act 1983
(Cth).
If you are worried about how your personal information is being handled, if you would like to find out what personal information we have stored about you, or if you want us to update or correct your personal information, please contact the ABC Privacy Officer:
By email:
privacy.abc@abc.net.au

Sometimes it may be possible for you to provide information to the ABC without disclosing your real identity. For example, signing up for an ABC Account or an ABC iview Account using an email address that does not include your name and using a nickname.
Other times this will not be possible, for example where you must disclose your identity before being granted entry to the ABC studio as an audience member.
To understand who the ABC may
share your personal information with please read this section.
You don’t have to give us all the information we ask for, but this may limit how we interact with you, and the services that we can provide.
We collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information when you:
Register for an ABC Account
The data we collect may be used for the following purposes:
ABC Account administration;
helping us understand more about the composition, interests, and behaviours of our audiences to see whether we are reaching a broad cross-section of Australians in accordance with our objectives;
helping our audiences find content likely to be of interest to them including by giving recommendations. As  an ABC Account holder you still have access to all of our content and can choose content independently of our recommendations, or you can opt-out of recommendations via your Account Settings if you prefer;
performing research and analysis, including receiving anonymised, aggregated reports, aimed at improving our content, services and reach;
providing you with information about ABC activities, products, services and events that may be of interest to you - this includes promotions for ABC content on third party digital services as well as ABC digital services; and
combining your account information with data we collect about your use of our digital services, including behavioural and location data, and other information you provide to the ABC. This combined information may include data that we have already collected about you.
If you are a registered ABC Account holder, we may disclose a hashed version of your email address to Google and Meta, via a technology service provider called Tealium, to show you promotions for ABC content likely to be of interest to you on those platforms.  For an explanation of hashing technology and how it is used, including how to opt-out, please click
here
.
If you are not a registered ABC Account holder, or you are accessing an ABC digital platform while not logged into your ABC Account, we may disclose the identifier for your device or browser to Google and Meta, via Tealium, for the same purposes. This will only occur if you have opted-in to the use of device identifiers or cookies for marketing purposes.
If you sign up for an ABC Account via another account such as Google or Meta, we will receive your email address, first name, year of birth, gender, and location. We may also receive a link to your profile photo, but only if you give your consent to that platform.
For privacy controls that restrict personalised advertising based on your choices across digital networks more broadly, you can read
more information about that here
.
Register your interest to participate as an ABC audience member
When you register your interest to participate as an ABC audience member we will collect personal information from you.

The data we collect may be used for the following purposes:
administer your registration as an ABC audience member;
help us understand more about the composition and diversity of our audiences;
perform research and analysis aimed at improving our content and services; and
provide you with information about ABC activities, products, services and events that may interest you.

perform research and analysis aimed at improving our content, services and reach; and

The ABC is committed to protecting your privacy. We are bound by the
Privacy Act
1988
(Cth) and comply with our obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles.
When you register for an ABC Account, we collect: an email address, password, a name, location (post code or suburb only), year of birth and gender (with a prefer not to say option). It is necessary to complete each of these fields to register for an account.
The ABC will validate your email address by asking you to respond to a communication at that email address, but other than this does not check the accuracy of any information you submit.
You may sign up for an ABC Account by using an email address that does not include your name and by providing a nickname rather than your actual name. The same applies in relation to any profiles you create on ABC iview – you may provide a nickname rather than a name.
The ABC does not seek to identify anyone on the basis of the information submitted, unless for the purpose of addressing a query made by that account holder to the ABC.
If you sign up for an ABC Account via another account such as Google or Facebook, we will receive your email address, first name, year of birth, gender, and location. We may also receive a link to your profile photo, but only if you give your consent to that platform.
If someone else creates a profile for you on ABC iview under their account, that person will be required to provide us with a name, and a year of birth if the profile is for a child.
We may combine your account information with data we collect about your use of our digital services, including behavioural and location data, and other information you provide to the ABC. This combined information may include data that we have already collected about you.
The data we collect is used for the following purposes:
administration of your ABC Account;
helping us understand more about the composition, interests, and behaviours of our audiences to see whether we are reaching a broad cross-section of Australians in accordance with our objectives;
helping our audiences find content likely to be of interest to them including by giving recommendations (ABC Account holders still have access to all of our content and can therefore choose content independently of our recommendations, or they can opt-out of recommendations via their Account Settings if they prefer);
performing research and analysis, including receiving anonymised, aggregated reports, aimed at improving our content, services and reach; and
providing you with information about ABC activities, products, services and events that may be of interest to you (this includes promotions for ABC content on third party digital services as well as ABC digital services).
We
may
allow some third parties to use cookies and other technologies to collect data about your use of our digital services so that they can provide us with promotions, analytics, ratings, and marketing services. Some third parties may be able to match this data with personal information they already have about you.
We require that our service providers have appropriate controls to protect your personal information and that they only use your personal information for authorised purposes.
Some of our third party service providers have servers located overseas including in New Zealand, Singapore, the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada and the USA.
If you are a registered ABC Account holder, we may disclose a hashed version of your email address to Google and Facebook, via a technology service provider called Tealium, to show you promotions for ABC content likely to be of interest to you on those platforms.  For an explanation of hashing technology and how it is used, please click
here
.
You can opt out of the disclosure of a hashed version of your email address to
Google and Facebook
in your ABC Account settings. If your ABC Account is associated with the use of an ABC app on Apple’s iOS or tvOS software, we will not disclose a hashed version of your email address to Google and Facebook, and therefore the opt out function will not be available to you.
If you don’t want to see promotional information on Google and Facebook networks that is informed by your use of ABC digital services, you can opt-out of the disclosure of a hashed version of your email address to Google and Facebook via the ‘Promotions on Digital Platforms’ toggle in the Data and Privacy section of your ABC account settings.
For privacy controls that restrict personalised advertising based on your choices across digital networks more broadly, including outside of the ABC digital environment, you can opt out via the privacy settings on Facebook and Google platforms.  You can also visit
Your Online Choices
and do a blanket opt out for the organisations who signed up to Your Online Choices.
You have a right to access any personal information we hold and may ask us to update or correct your personal information. For more information on how you can access your personal information or contact us with any questions or privacy related complaints, please see our
Privacy Policy
or contact us at

Does the ABC allow third parties to use these technologies on its digital services?
If you have read the
ABC Privacy Policy
, you may have come across some terms you did not understand. We have provided additional details about these terms below.
API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It refers to a type of software that is used to help two different websites or apps communicate with each other.
Beacons
A “beacon” is a signal sent from your computer or device to a server on the Internet. Websites, apps and emails use software that reads cookies, local storage and other information stored on your computer or device and sends beacons to record that information.
This may include information about your user activity, including behavioural data such as your viewing history, location data such as your IP address, as well as information about your personalised settings and preferences.
Browser information
Browser information refers to some specific information about the web browser you are using when you contact the ABC. We may collect this information to help us understand and serve the browser technology our audiences are using, and to ensure that our Audience Support team can provide troubleshooting tips. This information may include the name and version of the browser you use when you contact us.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file saved in your internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) or device (smartphone, tablet) each time you visit an ABC website or mobile app. They are used to identify your browser and/or device.
For more information about how the ABC uses cookies, read the FAQ,
How does the ABC use cookies?
Device identifiers
A device identifier is a string of letters that uniquely identifies your device or the browser on your device. This information is used to identify your device or the browser on your device on return visits and can be used to follow your user activity over time and remember things such as your personalised settings and preferences.
Event ID
Every action on an ABC website or app, like playing a video on ABC iview, or clicking a link on an ABC website, is known as an Event. Each event has an Event ID, which helps us measure and improve ABC websites and apps, as well as provide personalisation services such as remembering where you left off on a program.
Hashing
Hashing is a way for two parties to confirm they have the same information without sharing the information. For example, it turns your email address from something like this, big.ted@abc.net.au, to something like this, ‘f3dc567c84efb0634a65e7hg4b’, which is called a token. The token is then shared with our third-party partners to show you relevant ABC promotions on their platforms, and to measure and improve ABC promotional campaigns.
IP address
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a series of numbers that identifies any device on a network. Computers use IP addresses to communicate with each other both over the internet as well as on other networks, such as the WiFi network in your home.
Local Storage
Local storage is a location within your web browser that websites and apps use to store files. These files are used to provide services such as saving your log in information or providing you with personalisation features.
Learn more about how the ABC uses these technologies by visiting our section on
Cookies and Other Technologies
, and reading the
ABC Privacy Policy

Sometimes it may be possible for you to provide information to the ABC without disclosing your real identity. For example, signing up for an ABC Account or an ABC iview Account using an email address that does not include your name and using a nickname.
Other times this will not be possible, for example where you must disclose your identity before being granted entry to the ABC studio as an audience member.
To understand who the ABC may
share your personal information with please read this section.
You don’t have to give us all the information we ask for, but this may limit how we interact with you, and the services that we can provide.
We collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information when you:
Register for an ABC Account
The data we collect may be used for the following purposes:
ABC Account administration;
helping us understand more about the composition, interests, and behaviours of our audiences to see whether we are reaching a broad cross-section of Australians in accordance with our objectives;
helping our audiences find content likely to be of interest to them including by giving recommendations. As  an ABC Account holder you still have access to all of our content and can choose content independently of our recommendations, or you can opt-out of recommendations via your Account Settings if you prefer;
performing research and analysis, including receiving anonymised, aggregated reports, aimed at improving our content, services and reach;
providing you with information about ABC activities, products, services and events that may be of interest to you - this includes promotions for ABC content on third party digital services as well as ABC digital services; and
combining your account information with data we collect about your use of our digital services, including behavioural and location data, and other information you provide to the ABC. This combined information may include data that we have already collected about you.
If you are a registered ABC Account holder, we may disclose a hashed version of your email address to Google and Meta, via a technology service provider called Tealium, to show you promotions for ABC content likely to be of interest to you on those platforms.  For an explanation of hashing technology and how it is used, including how to opt-out, please click
here
.
If you are not a registered ABC Account holder, or you are accessing an ABC digital platform while not logged into your ABC Account, we may disclose the identifier for your device or browser to Google and Meta, via Tealium, for the same purposes. This will only occur if you have opted-in to the use of device identifiers or cookies for marketing purposes.
If you sign up for an ABC Account via another account such as Google or Meta, we will receive your email address, first name, year of birth, gender, and location. We may also receive a link to your profile photo, but only if you give your consent to that platform.
For privacy controls that restrict personalised advertising based on your choices across digital networks more broadly, you can read
more information about that here

The ABC is committed to protecting your privacy by creating a safe and secure space for you to enjoy all ABC services, including our programs, websites, and apps. This Privacy Policy explains how and why we collect and use information about you, including:
what types of information we collect
how it is collected and used
how we keep your information safe
when and why we might share that information outside of the ABC
your choices about your information
The ABC collects and uses personal information so we can provide ABC content and services that inform, educate, and entertain and ensure they reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community.  Find out more about personal information by reading the FAQ,
What is Personal Information?
The ABC does not commercialise data. If we are required to disclose information, including your personal information, to help us provide services to you, we do not receive any sort of payment for doing this.
Children’s privacy is especially important – both protecting it and helping children, parents and guardians understand privacy risks.  You can
share this video
with children to help them understand privacy better.
Information we collect to make programs and produce other content is not covered by this Privacy Policy. The
ABC Editorial Policies
and the
ABC Code of Practice
explain how we approach privacy in relation to journalism.
To find out more about anything in this Privacy Policy, head to
Privacy at the ABC
where you will find FAQs with detailed information, including how to contact the
ABC Privacy Officer
.
1. Why does the ABC collect personal information?
The ABC collects information about you to deliver and improve the content and services the ABC provides.  This includes information about how you use our services.  By gaining a better understanding of what our audiences do and do not like, we can make sure our programs are relevant for all Australians. Collection of this information also helps us create a better experience for you, where you can easily discover and access content.
2. What personal information does the ABC collect?
There are different types of information we collect depending on the circumstances.  This information is either collected directly from you or is provided to us on your behalf by someone else. For example, if a parent or carer creates an ABC iview profile for you.
a) Signing up for an ABC Account
When you sign up for an ABC Account, we collect:
login details (like an email address and password)
first or preferred name
year of birth
postcode
gender identity (optional)
We collect this information so we can understand how to better serve our audiences. If you sign up using social media sign-on (such as Facebook, Google or Apple), we might receive other information about your account details, like your profile picture.  As with all personal information held by the ABC, this information is protected in accordance with ABC cyber security practices (see section 3 below).
b) Sensitive information
We might ask for sensitive information about you (like your ethnicity, political views, religious beliefs, physical and mental health, etc.), but only when it is necessary and relevant.
For example, if you are participating in audience research, this will ensure a more representative study sample.
Sensitive information is not shared outside the ABC. We will always ask for your consent when we request sensitive information, and you do not need to provide any sensitive information when you sign up for an ABC Account or to access ABC content or services.
c) Location
We might collect your location information so we can show you relevant local content. For example, you can enter your postcode on the ABC News website to receive local news and weather updates.
d) Entering a competition
We might ask for your name, contact details, and date of birth when you enter a competition, for example, to make sure you are eligible to enter an age restricted competition or so that we can contact you if you win.
e) Payment information
We collect payment information when you buy something from the ABC Merch Store or the triple j store.  This information is only used to process your payment.
If you use an online purchase service such as Shopify to complete your transaction, your personal information (including credit card information) will be collected and used by that service.
f) Device and browser information
Devices can be anything you use to access ABC content over the internet, like a smart TV, gaming console, mobile phone, tablet, or laptop.  A browser is an application for accessing websites.
We automatically collect some information from your device and browser to make sure our websites and apps run smoothly, and to help us provide technical support, and for analytics.
If you are logged in to an ABC Account at the time, we might link your device and browser information to your ABC Account.
You can find out more by visiting
Privacy at the ABC
.
g) Cookies and Other Technologies
We collect information about how you use ABC websites and apps using cookies, beacons, and local storage.
This helps us make sure the ABC websites and apps you are using work well.  For example, some cookies are used to remember your preferences.
For more information about how cookies and other online tools work, visit
Privacy at the ABC.
3. How does the ABC keep my personal information safe?
The ABC is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
The ABC’s cyber security practices are aligned with the cyber security principles and guidelines outlined in the Australian Commonwealth Government ‘Information Security Manual’ (ISM). We also have dedicated teams that look after the privacy and security of personal information held by the ABC.
Our cybersecurity team stays across the latest developments in online security and works with experts in online safety.
We restrict access to your data within the ABC to keep it safe.
ABC staff are trained in cyber security and practices that help keep your personal information safe and secure, including how to identify and respond to threats.
4. Why does the ABC share my personal information with others?
The ABC does not sell or share your personal information for commercial gain. But sometimes we do need to share information, which might include your personal information, with others.
The ABC partners with carefully selected organisations to help us safely collect, store, and manage your personal information.
This means we might share your information with those organisations so we can do things like:
send you the ABC Newsletters you subscribe to
show you recommended programs on ABC iview
create your ABC Account
a) To deliver a personalised experience
Personalisation has become an important part of how the world enjoys online content.
This means when you use ABC websites and apps, you might be shown some content that is relevant to your interests.
For example, the
Recommended
For You
rail on ABC iview helps you discover new programs.
We can do this by understanding what you watch, read and listen to on ABC websites and apps.
We might then combine this information with other information you provide when signing up for an ABC Account, subscribing to ABC Newsletters, or creating profiles on ABC iview, such as your age or location.
We use this to help you discover programs you might like. More details can be found in the FAQ,
What are Personalised Recommendations?
If you have an ABC Account, you can
opt-out of receiving personalised recommendations
by accessing your
ABC Account settings
.
b) To help us monitor and improve ABC programs, websites, and apps
We might share some information, including how ABC websites and apps are used, and information about devices used to access ABC services with our analytics and ratings service providers.
For more details on our analytics and ratings service providers, visit
Privacy at the ABC
.
c) To show you relevant promotions on ABC and non-ABC websites and apps
We use device IDs, hashed email addresses and other online tools to show you relevant promotions for ABC content on other websites and apps you might be using.
This could be a sponsored post on Instagram or Facebook for triple j’s
Like A Version
, or a promotion for the latest episode of a drama program when you’re browsing Google.
For more information about how cookies and other online tools work, visit
Privacy at the ABC.
For more information on hashed email address sharing read the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
i. device ID
We will only share your device ID with Google or Meta with your permission.  We share this information so that if you use those platforms, we can show you ABC promotions that you are more likely to be interested in.
We will always ask for your permission before we do this, and you can easily opt-out by
managing your device ID settings
.
ii. hashed email address sharing
If you are signed up for an ABC Account, a hashed version of your email address may be shared with Google and Meta.  We do this so that if you use those platforms, we can show you ABC promotions that you are more likely to be interested in, as well as measure and improve ABC promotional campaigns.
If you are not comfortable with this, you can opt-out by managing your
ABC Account settings
.
Learn more by reading the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
iii. IP address
We may share your IP address with third parties to help us measure and improve ABC promotional campaigns.
If you are an ABC Account holder, you can opt-out by managing your
ABC Account settings
.
Learn more by reading the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
5. Additional privacy terms
Some ABC content and services are offered using non-ABC websites and apps.
For example, the triple j app allows you to send a playlist to YouTube Music. The YouTube Terms of Service are available
here
.
You should read the privacy policy and terms and conditions of each service carefully before deciding whether to accept them.
In addition, if the ABC embeds posts, photos or videos from third parties, such as Facebook or YouTube, those third parties may use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies in relation to that content. If you then “share” that content, the service you have chosen to share content through may also use these technologies.
For more information about how cookies and other online tools work, visit
Privacy at the ABC.
You should also only post information online if you are happy for it to be publicly available.
6. Is my personal information sent overseas?
Some companies we partner have storage locations in Australia while others are outside Australia, including but not limited to Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK, and the USA.
We only disclose personal information to overseas recipients if we are satisfied that our service providers have appropriate controls to protect your personal information and that they only use your personal information for purposes we authorise.
7. How does the ABC protect younger children and teenagers?
The ABC is committed to creating a safe and secure space for young people to enjoy their favourite ABC programs and other content.
We provide services like ABC Kids for pre-school children, and ABC Big Kids for primary school-aged children. These services provide ABC programming that is appropriate for young people. When a profile is created for a child on ABC iview, we make sure the content available to them is suitable for their age. In a child’s profile, only ABC Kids is accessible to younger children up to 6 years old, unless their parent or guardian enables them to also have access to ABC Big Kids. Older children get access to both ABC Kids and ABC Big Kids.
However, we strongly encourage parents and carers to monitor and participate in their children’s use of ABC websites and apps.
For more information, visit
Protecting Families and Children
.
8. Will my child’s personal information be used for marketing purposes?
No, the use of device IDs for promotional purposes, and the use of any personal information for measuring ABC promotions is disabled in:
children’s ABC Accounts
ABC iview children’s profiles created under adult ABC Accounts
ABC Kids and ABC Big Kids website and app
In addition, children’s ABC Accounts are automatically opted-out of hashed email address sharing. Learn more by reading the FAQ,
What are Promotions on Digital Platforms?
9. Can I contact the ABC about privacy issues?
Yes, we welcome any feedback you might have about privacy-related issues.
You also have the right to request access to, or seek the correction of any personal information we might have about you. Deletion requests are subject to the ABC's record-keeping obligations, including the
Archives Act 1983
(Cth).
