Privacy Statement for Microsoft Lync 2013 Products

. In order to understand the data collection and use practices relevant for a particular Microsoft Lync product or service, you should read both the Privacy statement for Microsoft Lync products and this supplement.
This privacy supplement addresses the deployment and use of Microsoft Lync 2013 for iPhone on your enterprise’s mobile devices. If you’re using Microsoft Lync Server communications software as a service (in other words, if a third party [for example, Microsoft] is hosting the servers on which the software runs), information will be transmitted to that third party. To learn more about the use of data that is transmitted from your enterprise to that third party, check with your enterprise administrator or your service provider.

Call Delegation (Call Forwarding/Simultaneous Ring)
What This Feature Does
: Call delegation lets users assign one or more delegate(s) that can make or answer calls, and set up and join Lync Meetings on your behalf. Users can also choose to automatically forward calls to voice mail, another number or delegate, or simultaneously ring both their primary number and an alternate number such as a mobile device, delegate, or call-group.
Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted
: When assigning delegates, delegate contact information must be provided by the user during the configuration process. Users who are set up as delegates receive a notification informing them that someone in their organization has designated them as a delegate. When delegate(s) answer a call on behalf of the person who has assigned them as a delegate, that person receives an email notification informing them about this event. No information is sent to Microsoft.
Use of Information
: Lync uses the delegate’s contact information to allow them to make or receive calls and schedule or join meetings on behalf of the person to whom they are a delegate.
Choice/Control
: By default, call delegation is off and it can be enabled or disabled as follows:
In Lync for iPhone, on the
My Info
tab, tap
Call Forwarding

Tap your current call forwarding setting and, from the list of options that appears, select
Delegates

: Send Logs allows the user to send the client-side logs to Microsoft to help investigate any audio or connectivity issues that might be encountered (see the Client-side Logging section).
Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted
: If client-side logging is enabled, only the information that client-side logging collects is sent. Client-side logs aren’t automatically sent from your device. Instead, logs are sent only when logging has been enabled on your device (see the Client-side Logging section).
Use of Information
: The information collected from your device is used to help troubleshoot the problem that you encountered, and to help improve Lync.
Choice/Control
: To use Send Logs the user must have email enabled on their device. For information about how to enable and configure email, see the device’s user guide.
Client-side logs can be sent as follows:
In Lync for iPhone, on the
My Info
tab, tap
Options
.
Select
Logging
from the list of options.
On the
Logging
options page, tap
Send Log Files
.
In the email form that opens with the logs attached, type the destination email address, and then tap
Send
.

Sign-in Error Reporting
What This Feature Does
: The Sign-in Error Reporting feature automatically generates an error report when a user unsuccessfully tries to sign in to Lync. The user then will be given the option to send the error report to Microsoft.
Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted
: The information collected in the error report contains information such as the quality of the user’s Internet connection and any error codes or exception data generated as a result of the failed sign-in attempts. The report may also contain personally identifiable information such as the user’s IP address and Session Initiation Protocol Uniform Resource Identifier (SIP URI). This information may be sent to Microsoft.
Use of Information
: The data contained in the Sign-in Error Report is used by Microsoft to help troubleshoot logon issues. It will also be used by Microsoft to identify common logon issues, and trends to help improve the Lync logon experience.
Choice/Control
: By default, this feature is off and can be managed by the enterprise administrator. The administrator can choose to always send or never send the sign-in error report to Microsoft, or to allow the user to decide.
The user can change their preferences as follows:
In Lync for iPhone, on the
My Info
tab, tap
Options
.
Select
Logging
from the list of options.
On the
Logging
options page, tap “
Upload Sign-in Errors.
”
Select the setting you want─ “Always”, “Never”, or “Ask Me.”

Unified Contact Store
What This Feature Does
: The Unified Contact Store consists of three main features. The following are available in Lync for iPhone:
Search Merge
–Merges your Global Address List (GAL) with your personal Outlook contacts so that when you search for a contact, there will be only a single entry in the search results.
Contact Merge
– Aggregates contact information between Outlook and GAL entries using matching email and/or sign-in identifiers. Once a match is determined, Lync aggregates data from three data sources (Outlook, GAL, and presence). This aggregated data is displayed in various user interface components, including search results, your Contacts list, and a contact card.
Information
Collected, Processed, or Transmitted
: Lync for iPhone aggregates contact information from Outlook, Active Directory Domain Services, presence, and iPhone. This information is used internally by Lync for iPhone.
Use of Information
: Contact information from Outlook, Active Directory Domain Services, presence, and iPhone is shown in the Lync for iPhone UI.
Choice/Control
: Unified Contact Store settings are managed from the Lync desktop client.

Voice Quality Improvements
What This Feature Does
: Lync sends information to remote parties if it detects device or network issues during a call, to indicate that you may have poor voice quality.
Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted
: If you have a device setup that is adding poor audio in a call (for example, echo or noise), Lync also inform others in the call that the quality of the call is being degraded because of the device setup at your end. Others are only shown a notification that you are using a device that is causing poor audio quality. They don't know what device you’re using. No information is sent to Microsoft.
Use of Information
: The information sent to others in the call helps them improve the quality of the call. For example, presenters can mute your line if you’re just listening in on the call.
Choice/Control
: Lync doesn’t allow you to turn off call quality notifications.
