Beacon Walker
Simplified iBeacon Development
Working with iBeacons can be challenging, especially when you have a setup where you need to read beacons in a sequence.
With Beacon Walker, you can simulate any number of iBeacons and virtually walk through any setup, no matter if big or small.
The app uses JSON data files to define its environment. You can edit these files easily on your computer and they’ll sync via iCloud. The app comes with a sample JSON file so you can explore options and modify it to meet your own needs.
