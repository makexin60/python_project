Sale of personal information and Opt-out
Please Notice that we do not 'sell' Personal Information about our users as most people would typically understand that term. 
However, the CCPA defines a sale as the exchange of someone’s personal information for money 'or other valuable consideration.'
As a consequence, the collection of personal information by some of our partners could be considered a sale regarding the CCPA.
In order to opt-out to the collection of personal information in the app for such purposes, 
US users can open the privacy settings with the 'Do Not Sell My Personal Information' button which is on the pop-up shown at the first launch of the app and also in the main menu of the app.
Please refer to the section 'Opt-out' for more details.
