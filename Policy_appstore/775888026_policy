Privacy Policy for Your Android App
Want to learn more about how to add a privacy policy to your Android app? It can be a tricky task since there are quite a few requirements to follow! But, we’ve got you covered.
Google Play has made it a basic requirement to make certain privacy-related disclosures to users, in accordance with
applicable law
. These disclosures are typically made available to users via a privacy notice that is easily accessible from within the app.
👀
In this comprehensive guide we explain all the main legal privacy requirements for Android apps and how you can easily generate a privacy for your app. Let’s dive in!

Google Play and Child Safety
How to Add a Privacy Policy to your Android App
In Short
Here’s what Google had to say in their Developer Policy Center’s
User Data guidelines
:
You must be transparent in how you handle user data (e.g., information provided by a user, collected about a user, and collected about a user’s use of the app or device), including by disclosing the collection, use, and sharing of the data, and you must limit use of the data to the description in the disclosure. If your app handles personal or sensitive user data, there are additional requirements described below. This policy establishes Google Play’s minimum privacy requirements; you or your app may need to comply with additional restrictions or procedures if required by an applicable law.
Now, Google Play only
explicitly
requires
that a link to a privacy policy be visible on your app’s store listing page and within your app in cases where:
Your app handles personal or sensitive user data
, as defined in the
user data policies
(including personally identifiable information, financial and payment information, authentication information, phonebook or contact data, microphone and camera sensor data, and sensitive device data).
Your app is in the
“Designed for Families” program
(regardless of access to sensitive permissions or data).
However, it is critical to note here that, platform requirements aside,
under the vast majority of legislations, and particularly under the GDPR,
privacy notices
are legally required
.
Generally, failure to adhere to these laws can result in hefty fines, sanctions, audits and/or leave you open to litigation.
Privacy Policy Requirements for an Android App
A lot of people ask for
sample privacy policies for apps
. The exact required contents of a privacy policy depends upon the law applicable to you and may even need to address requirements across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions.
For this reason, it’s always advisable that you approach your (legally mandated) privacy policy with the strictest applicable regulations in mind. You can read our in-depth
Legal Overview Guide here
.
💡 Not sure what privacy laws
actually
apply to you?
🚀 Do this free 1-min quiz to find out
!
Let’s start with the
legal minimum requirements
.
These are the most basic elements that a privacy policy should have:
Who is the
app owner
?
What data
is being collected?
How
is that data being collected?
What is the
legal basis
for the collection? (e.g consent, necessary for your service, legal obligation etc.)
– This is more specifically related to the GDPR and EU Law, however, even if you fall outside of GDPR obligations, under most countries’ legislations, you’ll still need to say why you’re processing the personal data of users
.
For which
specific purposes
are the data collected? Analytics? Email Marketing?
Which
third parties
will have access to the information? Will any third party collect data through widgets (e.g. social buttons) and integrations (e.g. Facebook Connect)?
What
rights
do users have? Can they request to see the data you have on them, can they request to rectify, erase or block their data? (under
European regulations
most of this is mandatory)
Description of
process for notifying
users and visitors of changes or updates to the privacy policy
Effective
date
of the privacy policy
Android App: Sensitive permissions
In addition to the above, you need to make sure that you disclose your use of any of the following
“dangerous” permission groups
.
Disclose your use of any of the following “dangerous” permission groups:
These personal or sensitive user data mentioned earlier include:
calendar;
camera;
contacts;
location;
microphone;
phone;
sensors;
SMS;
storage.
What should I do?
You have two options:
remove
all
requests for user data or sensitive permissions (you will not need to add a privacy policy if you remove these requests); or
add a valid privacy policy in two places: your app’s Store listing page and within your app.
💡 More on
How to Add Android and iOS Mobile Permissions for Device Data
.
Android App: Prominent disclosures
If your app processes the personal data of users for
reasons unrelated to the functionality of
your app
, you’re required to make additional, easily visible disclosures about this usage and collect user consent where required.
Here’s what Google states about prominent disclosures:
If your app collects and transmits personal or sensitive user data
unrelated
to functionality described prominently in the app’s listing on Google Play or in the app interface, then
prior to the collection and transmission
, it must prominently highlight how the user data will be used and have the user provide affirmative consent for such use.
Your in-app disclosure:
Must be within the app itself, not only in the Play listing or a website;
Must be displayed in the normal usage of the app and not require the user to navigate into a menu or settings;
Must describe the type of data being collected;
Must explain how the data will be used;
Cannot only be placed in a privacy policy or terms of service; and
Cannot be included with other disclosures unrelated to personal or sensitive data collection.
Your app’s request for consent:
Must present the consent dialog in a clear and unambiguous way;
Must require affirmative user action (e.g. tap to accept, tick a check-box, a verbal command, etc.) in order to accept;
Must not begin personal or sensitive data collection prior to obtaining affirmative consent;
Must not consider navigation away from the disclosure (including tapping away or pressing the back or home button) as consent; and
Must not utilize auto-dismissing or expiring messages.
💡 It’s worth noting that it seems that Google considers any data collection activity that isn’t made obvious from your app page or from within your interface to be covered by this prominent disclosure policy.
👉 Therefore a separate user notice is required
in addition to
your privacy policy – which your notice should ultimately link – to for a full explanation of the data processed. Again, the data
must
not be processed until you have affirmative consent by your user.
👉 Furthermore, under regulations like the GDPR, you are
legally
required to obtain informed,
explicit consent
before processing any personal data of users specifically where it falls outside the what’s required for the functioning of your service.
What should I do?
With this in mind,
you have 2 options
when it comes to dealing with this kind of data processing. You can either:
remove this type of data collection; or
properly inform via in-app disclosures, link that notice to the respective privacy policy and collect valid consent.
🔍 If you fall within the
scope of the GDPR
, you’ll likely also need to maintain valid
records of consent
.
Privacy Policy Example for an Android App
Here’s a full example of a privacy policy for an
Android app
, created with
our Privacy and Cookie Policy Generator
:
Click here for example
Google Play and Child Safety
Google has introduced a few policy updates in order to
make the Play Store more child-friendly
. If an app is likely to be used by kids,
developers
are subject to additional safety requirements which came into force on September 1, 2019.
1. Target Audience and App Content
Apps on Google Play are categorized, and policies applied, according to the following target audience groups: children, children and older users, older users. Google states that they will verify that the
target audience
selected is in fact correct.
All apps whose target audience is primarily children must follow
Families policy and Designed for Families program requirements
.
In short:
App content that is accessible to children must be appropriate for children.
Both new and existing apps are now subject to the
target audience questionnaire
. You must accurately answer the questions in the Google Play Console and ensure that those answers are correctly updated if you make any changes to your app.
💡 We have a great recap on app privacy requirements for kids. Read it
here
!
2. APIs, SDKs and Neutral Age Screen
Apps that solely target children
must not contain any APIs or SDKs that are not approved for use in child-directed services
.
Apps that target both children and older audiences should not implement APIs or SDKs that are not approved for use in child-directed services unless they are used behind a
neutral age screen
or implemented in a way that does not result in the collection of data from children.
What the Play Console Help says:
“A neutral age screen is a mechanism to verify a user’s age in a way that doesn’t encourage them to falsify their age and gain access to areas of your app that aren’t designed for children, for example an age gate. An example of this would be a system that asks users to freely enter their month, day, and year of birth. An incorrect setup of a neutral age screen would be presetting the birth date to the required age (e.g., 13 years old) or indicating that a certain age is required to access areas of the app.”
3. Ads
In order to make sure that any ads served to children (or users of unknown age) are appropriate and compliant with
Google’s policies
,
you must
use
Google Play certified ad networks
.
4. Android Apps with unintentional appeal to children
Google also wants developers to ensure that their apps don’t inadvertently attract children (for example with youthful animations or young characters in the graphic assets) if their content is actually designed for adults. More info on how to display the “Not designed for children” label in the store listing can be found
here
.
🔍 Terms and Conditions for Mobile Apps
Terms and Conditions
(also called ToS – Terms of Service, Terms of Use or EULA – End User License Agreement) set the way in which your product, service or content may be used, in a legally binding way.
In general, you’ll likely need to set Terms and Conditions if you have an app that participates in some form of commerce (whether selling to users directly or facilitating trading). Additionally, some specific instances where they might be needed are where you:
need to make legally required disclosures related to consumer rights (especially withdrawal and cancellation rights);
have different user levels (eg. registered vs non-registered);
your platform allows users to sell or trade with other users;
facilitate or otherwise process payments and/or other sensitive user data;
want to set the rules for user behavior and state grounds for termination of accounts;
participate in affiliate programs;
provide a software or service which can potentially cause harm if misused;
would like to have some legally enforceable control over, and set rules about, how your app may be used.

How to Add a Privacy Policy to your Android App
iubenda
makes solving this issue easy
: with hundreds of available clauses, our privacy policies contain all elements commonly required across many regions and services, while
applying the strictest standards by default – giving you the option to fully customize as needed
.
🚀 Our policies are created by lawyers, monitored by our lawyers and hosted on our servers to ensure that they are
always up-to-date with the latest legal changes and third-party requirements
.
The process is straightforward and intuitive, simply:
click to add your services;
fill out your web/app owner and contact details;
embed.
💡
Click here
to read the full guide on how to generate a Privacy Policy.
Here’s
how you can use iubenda to create a privacy policy for your Android app
:
1. Add your services
If you use Twitter or other auth (=OAuth) services for user management, then
add the respective service
by clicking “Add a service” then start typing the name of the service you’d like to add. Remember to include all services processing personal information. If you handle user registration yourself, don’t forget to add the “Direct Registration” service.
Select applicable services from the list and add the specific types of personal data you collect 👉
our lawyer-crafted clauses automatically include the relevant user-rights disclosures and service definitions based on your input here.
Add our service called “
Device permissions for Personal Data access
” if your app requests
sensitive permissions
(e.g. camera, microphone, accounts, contacts, or phone) or user data:
If you’d like to
add a custom service clause
, simply click the “Create custom service” button and fill out the built-in form.
2. Fill out your app owner and contact details
Enter:
name and full address;
email address.
🎉
Congratulations! Your policy has been created. Simply check that all the details are correct, then embed.
3. Embed
As we said above, you have to include a link to your privacy policy within the app
and
in the Google Play Store app listing (and – potentially – on the marketing site you operate for it).
Within the App
For apps, the
direct link
or
direct text
embedding methods are best. If your app processes user data while offline, be sure to provide users with an
in-app offline method
of accessing the privacy policy in order to be legally compliant.
Whichever embed method you choose, remember that you’re required to choose a
location
that is
easily accessible and visible
to users.
Google Play Store Listing
When
your app is ready
, in addition to the app’s internal link, you’ll have to include a link to your privacy policy on the Google Play Store. Here’s how to meet this requirement:
Go to your
Google Play Console
Select an app
Select
Store presence > Store listing
Under “Privacy Policy”, enter the
iubenda direct link
(since we host your policy, you won’t get the “You are not allowed that domain for a privacy policy URL” error)
Save your changes
This will make sure that you have your privacy policy linked under
Additional information > Developer
on the
Google Play Store
like so:
🔍 In short
Platform requirements aside, under the vast majority of legislations (and particularly under the GDPR)
privacy notices are legally required
.
If your app handles personal or sensitive user data, or is in the “Designed for Families” program, you need to
add a valid privacy policy in two places: your app’s Store listing page and within your app
.
If applicable, you have to disclose how you treat sensitive user and device data.
If your
app
processes personal data for reasons unrelated to its functionality, you must highlight – prior to the collection and transmission – how the user data will be used and collect user consent.
If your app is likely to be used by kids, you are subject to additional safety requirements.
With iubenda
you can create a privacy policy (and a Terms and Conditions document) for your Android app

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:

.
Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase Realtime Database
Cloud Storage for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Test Lab
Firebase App Check
Firebase App Distribution
Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
resource identifiers like application IDs and package name/bundle IDs, technical
and operational details of usage such as IP addresses, and direct communications
with developers from feedback and support related conversations.
*Services covered include Firebase A/B Testing, Firebase App Distribution,
  Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Dynamic Links,
  Firebase Hosting, Firebase In-App Messaging, Firebase ML,
  Firebase Performance Monitoring, Firebase Realtime Database,
  Firebase Remote Config, and Firebase User Segmentation Storage.
