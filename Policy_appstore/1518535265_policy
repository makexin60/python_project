Privacy Policy
Dragon FaFa Technology is committed to protecting the privacy of its users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy
          Policy has been created to inform you about how Dragon FaFa Technology manages, collects, stores and uses the
          information you provide in connection with any Dragon FaFa Technology game ("Service"). Please note that the
          scope of this Privacy Policy is limited only to information collected by Dragon FaFa Technology through your
          use of a Service.
By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this
          Privacy Policy. Dragon FaFa Technology may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and Dragon FaFa
          Technology encourages you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes. If you do not agree to the
          policy, you can opt out of the services.
1.Information We Collect and How We Collect It
Dragon FaFa Technology's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the
          Service and to enable users to enjoy the Service.
When you install any of the Services, Dragon FaFa Technology may collect and record the information you
          provide to Dragon FaFa Technology, whether through the Services or through social network or other third party
          services ("Account Information")
          Personal information.
"Personal information" means information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. The personal
          information types collected in accordance with a Service may vary depending on the activity and may include:
(1) Your user name;
(2) Your social network or third party service user identification number;
(3) Your mobile device's unique identifier (UDID);
(4) Transaction identifiers for purchases;
(5) Your email address;
(6) Your profile picture; or
(7) Any other relevant information included in your application, social network or other online profile.
Additionally, Dragon FaFa Technology may acquire information from you through:
(1) Your access and participation in message boards on a Service;
(2) The contents of your Customer Support requests; or
(3) Your purchase of a virtual product of any type.
Please note that because a third party site manages the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service,
          Dragon FaFa Technology does not have access to your credit card details or billing information.
Non-Personal Information
"Non-personal information" is information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you.
          Dragon FaFa Technology may collect non-personal information about your use of its Service both in the course
          of game play and software usage. Dragon FaFa Technology may also invite you to share non-personal information
          about yourself which may include but is not limited to:
(1) Your age or date of birth;
(2) Your gender;
(3) Information about the hardware you may own;
(4) Your favorite websites, friend information and fan pages; or
(5) Any other information included in your application, social network or other online profile.
If non-Personal Information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, Dragon FaFa
          Technology may combine your non-personal information with your personal information in an attempt to provide
          you with a better user experience, to improve the value and quality of the Services and to analyze how its
          Services are used. The Service may also record game play information such as your game session duration or
          your high scores.
In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose to share additional information about
          yourself throughout the Service, such as on message boards and in games. Any actions you perform with other
          players are considered public, and are in your sole discretion.
Other information Dragon FaFa Technology may collect includes your occupation, language, zip code, area code,
          location, and the time zone where a Service is used, as well as information about your computer, mobile
          device, software, platform, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC)
          address and connection, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and URLs, number of
          clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on
          particular pages, and the date and time of this activity, so that Dragon FaFa Technology can better understand
          customer behavior and improve its products, services, and advertising. Dragon FaFa Technology may also receive
          either non-personal or public information from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies
          and/or data that Dragon FaFa Technology may use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.
2.How Dragon FaFa Technology Uses Your Information
Dragon FaFa Technology uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders and to send
          you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. In addition, the personal information you
          provide will allow Dragon FaFa Technology to send you messages regarding, among other things, new products,
          features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You may also
          later opt out of certain of these communications. You may opt out of all communications from Dragon FaFa
          Technology by sending an e-mail to: Dragon FaFa Technologypoker@gmail.com .
Dragon FaFa Technology may also use personal and non-personal information, both individually and combined
          together, to better understand the behavior and preferences of its customers, to troubleshoot technical
          problems, to serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce its Terms of Service, to ensure proper
          functioning of its products and services as well as to help improve Services and their content. In addition,
          Dragon FaFa Technology may combine non-personal information with personal information, such as an email
          address, to administer loyalty programs, tailor its offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.
By use of friend finder tools whether directly through the Service or through a social network or gaming
          service, you acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also
          allow your contacts to associate your Service account (and related gaming entitlements, including games
          played, spins and coins) with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friendsâ€™
          list will be subject to this privacy policy.
If you choose to use a referral service to "tell a friend" about a Service, Dragon FaFa Technology may ask you
          for your friend's name and email address. Dragon FaFa Technology will send your friend an email on your behalf
          or a text message inviting him or her to visit the relevant site or check out the Service. Dragon FaFa
          Technology stores your friend's name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email
          and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email
          message. Dragon FaFa Technology does not keep or use this information for any other purpose.
In all cases of data access and collection, the information you provide will not be disclosed, rented, loaned,
          leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties and will be used solely for
          the purpose of providing you with and improving the Service and for any other purpose stated herein. Dragon
          FaFa Technology will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
          services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that Dragon FaFa Technology no longer use your
          information contact Dragon FaFa Technology at the email address provided in the Contact Us section below. Note
          that there may be instances where Dragon FaFa Technology is legally required to retain your information.
3.Access through Social Network Services or Mobile Devices
By accessing the Service through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or service or
          by connecting to such a third party network, platform or service via a Service, you are authorizing Dragon
          FaFa Technology to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that
          you agreed the social network, mobile device or other third party platform could provide to Dragon FaFa
          Technology through the social network/mobile device/third party platform Application Programming Interface
          (API) based on your settings on the third party social network, mobile device or platform. Your agreement
          takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or service via the Service, and/or when
          you connect with a Service, or "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) a Service to access your information
          through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or service.
Dragon FaFa Technology may also collect or receive information about you from other Service users who choose
          to upload their email contacts. This information will be stored by Dragon FaFa Technology and used primarily
          to help you and your friends connect.
4.Third Party Service Providers
Dragon FaFa Technology may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate its Services, to provide
          the Services on its behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database
          management, web analytics and improvement of the Services) or to assist Dragon FaFa Technology in analyzing
          how its Services are used.
From time to time, Dragon FaFa Technology employs third party contractors to collect personal information on
          its behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration,
          credit card processing or other services through the Service. When requesting these services, you may be asked
          to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to its contractors. Dragon FaFa
          Technology may ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research
          firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to Dragon FaFa Technology for its own marketing and
          demographic studies, so that Dragon FaFa Technology can consistently improve its sites and related advertising
          to better meet its visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich its understanding of individual customers,
          Dragon FaFa Technology may tie this information to the information you provide to it.
5.Message Boards and Chat Rooms

          expectation of privacy or confidentiality.
You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public
          activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you

          responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to post through a Service.
6.Browser Use
Note that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to
          third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. Dragon FaFa Technology has no control over
          the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure

7.Disclosure of Your Personal Information
You understand and agree that Dragon FaFa Technology may be required to disclose any personal information if

8.Cookies
Like many websites, Dragon FaFa Technology may use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data
          file that is transferred to your computerâ€™s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The
          Service may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. Information
          contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of
          Dragon FaFa Technologyâ€™s service, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to
          use. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. Cookies can be
          disabled at any time by changing your web browserâ€™s options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
          accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to
          use all portions or functionalities of a Service.
9.Links
The Service may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website
          or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that Dragon FaFa
          Technology endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that
          third party. If you click on a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, you
          will leave the Dragon FaFa Technology site you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the
          site or application linked to. These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or
          other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you.
          Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal
          information you submit to them. Because Dragon FaFa Technology cannot control the activities of third parties,
          it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it cannot
          guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Dragon FaFa Technology. You are
          therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit
          before providing any personal information.
