Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us, and so is being transparent about the data we store, use, and share with third parties in order to run the FeaturePoints service. FeaturePoints is compliant with the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
This privacy policy covers the information we collect about you when you use the FeaturePoints service. If you do not agree with any part of our privacy policy, you may not use FeaturePoints. By agreeing to this privacy policy, you are providing FeaturePoints with consent for your information to be collected for the purpose of operating the FeaturePoints service.
This privacy policy was last updated on October 18 2022.
How Data You Provide to Us is Used, Processed, and Shared
As part of using FeaturePoints, it is necessary for us to collect some information about you in order to run the FeaturePoints service.
Email Address
If you choose to add your email to your FeaturePoints account, this will be used to send reward notifications, send transactional emails, and send newsletters. You can opt to unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time. In order to provide our transactional and newsletter emails, your email address will be shared with our third-party email service to enable us to send emails to you. Your email address may also be shared with Facebook, Twitter, and Google for the purposes of ad targeting through their respective platforms.
Some rewards may require that your email is shared with third-party reward providers who provide distribution of their rewards — for example, this includes sharing your email with PayPal for sending payments to your PayPal account, and Coinbase for sending payments to your Coinbase account.
Additionally, you can opt-in to share your email address with our third-party survey partners so they can offer more surveys to you. This is optional, and you will be presented with a confirmation screen before your email is shared.
IP Address
We record your IP address whenever you use the FeaturePoints service in order to provide country localization, security, and fraud prevention. Your IP address may be shared with Google and Facebook for the purposes of site analytics and metrics.
Your IP address is shared with our third-party offer providers when you request the earn feed inside FeaturePoints, and when you choose an offer to complete. Your IP address may also be shared with third-party security and fraud prevention services to detect fraudulent activity and stop fraud attempts on the FeaturePoints system.
First and Last Name
If you provide us with your first and last name, it may be used to provide personalization throughout the FeaturePoints website, app, and our emails. Your first name and the first letter of your last name may be used as part of our referral program to allow others to associate your identity with your personal referral code.
Device Identifiers
When using FeaturePoints, we need to collect unique and generic identifiers from your device that allows us to associate your device with your account — these identifiers include the user agent provided by your browser, and IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) on iOS or Advertising ID on Android.
Survey Information
If you opt to answer survey questions within FeaturePoints, this survey data may be used by us and shared with our third-party survey partners to provide relevant surveys that are catered to you. This survey data may include your country, zip or postal code, and date of birth. Completing these survey questions is optional. When you complete surveys on our survey partners' third-party websites, you have a direct relationship with the survey partner and are subject to the survey partner's terms of service and privacy policy — as a result, any data access or erasure requests for data provided to the survey partner on their website will need to be made directly with the survey partner.

Terms
Welcome to FeaturePoints. Your use of FeaturePoints is subject to these terms and our privacy policy. If you do not agree with any part of these terms or our privacy policy, you may not use FeaturePoints. These terms are a legal agreement between you and FeaturePoints for your use of the FeaturePoints service.
FeaturePoints reserves the right to update and change this agreement at any time without notice or acceptance by you.
Content
All text, graphics, user interfaces, photographs, trademarks, logos, artwork and computer code (collectively "Content"), including but not limited to the ‘look and feel’ and arrangement of such Content, contained on this Site is owned and controlled by FeaturePoints, or its respective owners, and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws. No part of the Content may be copied, reproduced, or distributed in any way to any other computer, server, website or other medium without FeaturePoints; explicit prior written consent.
Account Limit
You can use one account per person and per device, and can use the same account across multiple devices. If you are determined to have registered more than one account, all accounts will be terminated and any points earned on all accounts will be forfeited.
Rewards
Any gift cards or cryptocurrency payments (collectively "rewards"), in addition to unused balances, are not redeemable for cash and cannot be exchanged, resold, or returned for a cash refund (except as required by law). Unused balances are not transferable. Before purchasing a reward, it is solely your responsibility to verify the relevant services are available in the country where you plan to redeem your reward. Neither FeaturePoints nor its affiliates are responsible for lost, stolen or malfunctioning rewards.
Referral Program
Sharing FeaturePoints with your friends is an easy way to earn points. When you refer your first two (2) friends, you will receive 10% of qualifying points they earn with FeaturePoints. "Qualifying points" includes points from completing surveys, app downloads (available on Android only), and cash back; "qualifying points" excludes points earned by referrals from their referrals, watching videos, Play and Earn, survey screen-out rewards, introductory internal surveys used to qualify users for third-party surveys, and any promotional or bonus points earned.
Cryptocurrency Rewards
Cryptocurrency rewards (such as Bitcoin payments) are facilitated by Coinbase. A Coinbase account is required to claim cryptocurrency rewards. FeaturePoints is unaffiliated with Coinbase, and we take no responsibility for their terms, policies, or actions related to your Coinbase account. If you do not already have a Coinbase account and are required to create an account in order to claim a reward, you may be subject to identity checks and verification with Coinbase.
Survey Qualification Questions
Some survey providers may ask you to provide answers to qualifying questions to verify that you are a suitable candidate for their surveys. If you are deemed not to be a suitable candidate for the survey, you may not receive any points as the survey may not have been fully completed.
Limitation of Liability
FeaturePoints and its licensors, or its affiliates are not liable for any act, or failure to act by them, or any other party regarding conduct, communication, or content on the Site or Service, and are not responsible for: (i) any incorrect or inaccurate information, printing errors, or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the the Site; (ii) technical failures of any kind, including but not limited to malfunctions, interruptions, traffic congestion, or disconnections in phone lines, internet connections, network hardware or software; (iii) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the Site or Service process; (iv) technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Site or the processing of account credits; (v) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, through the use or misuse of the Site.

Promoting the use of VPNs or proxy services to other FeaturePoints users and referrals is also not allowed, and will result in your account being terminated.
Temporary email services
Using services that allow the creation of temporary "throwaway" email accounts are prohibited. Accounts that use temporary email addresses will be terminated, and result in the forfeiture of any unredeemed points or rewards.
