Terms & Conditions
, Privacy Policy, and
User Agreement
. Please read them carefully and feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.

Privacy Policy
Date of last revision: December 10th, 2024
At Pronti AI Inc. (“Pronti”), your right to privacy is very important to us. We provide our users with the ability to analyze your wardrobe, through photographs uploaded by the user, and obtain suggestions for clothing combinations and outfits, as well as potential clothing purchase opportunities from third party sellers, among other features. In order to provide you with this service effectively, we collect certain specific information from you, and we also automatically collect information and data relating to the usage of our services by all our users, including you. Because we are committed to protecting your privacy rights and the information you provide to us, we have developed this privacy policy. It explains how we will protect your information and describes how we will use and share it.
This policy is concerned with the protection of personal information only. Personal information includes any data that can be used to identify you as an individual, including your name, income, personal opinion, interests, home contact information, identification numbers, user IDs, passwords, ethnic origin, and age.
This policy describes the following practices:
* Collecting personal information
* Sharing your personal information
* Maintaining your personal information
This privacy policy may change from time to time to reflect Pronti’s internal needs, customer feedback, or changes in applicable privacy legislation. Pronti will post all such changes on our website, so please visit this page regularly.
NOTE: Pronti software and services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or maintain any personal information or non-personally-identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 nor is any part of our website, software or service directed to children under the age of 13. We will close any accounts used exclusively by such children and will remove and/or delete any personal information we believe was submitted by, or pertains to, any child under the age of 13.
Collecting information
In order to use the services provided by Pronti, you will be required to provide specific information about yourself, such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. We will always inform you when we need information that personally identifies you, and we will keep this information in strict confidence. You may also, on occasion, voluntarily provide Pronti with information that can be classified as personal information – all such personal information will be stored and maintained in accordance with this privacy policy.
We collect information about you in the following ways:
As part of your registration and preference choices for Pronti’s services
Pronti offers the ability for you to choose options respecting the features of the services that you use. Additionally, we may require your name, address, telephone number and credit card or other payment processing information for billing purposes, where you opt for a paid service. This information is kept confidential and stored securely by Pronti.
Automatically by Pronti’s application and services
Pronti’s software and services contain features that automatically collect information from users. This includes, but is not limited to, usage statistics, unique IDs of installed applications, URLs visited, user IP addresses, and other environment-specific information such as device type, operating system, browser version, and application-specific logs and errors. Although some of this data may not identify you personally, it is handled with the same level of confidentiality and security as personal information, and certain elements may be anonymized before being shared with third parties. We are using Google’s Analytics to help collect crash information and understand how our app is used in order to improve the experience. Although this information may not identify you personally, it nevertheless provides certain information about you, and we therefore handle it as confidential information, with security measures to protect it, such as encryption and user authentication protocols.
Additionally, use of Pronti’s website and/or software may result in the collection of technical information such as your device type and software version, app store region and currency, computer's IP address, operating system, browser name/version, the referring web page, requested page, date/time, and sometimes a "cookie" (which can be disabled using your browser preferences); such information is used to help us understand the overall usage pattern of our website and software.
As part of your use of Pronti’s services
You may have the ability to post information through Pronti’s services or website, such as comments, that may be viewed by others within your organization, or by third parties, if you so choose. Please be advised that any personal information that you voluntarily post to any public forum or to any area where other users or third parties may legally access it, will NOT be considered confidential in any way, and Pronti will not have any obligation to protect it in a secured system or obtain your consent to its disclosure, as you will have made the decision to publicly post it. However, at your request, Pronti will be happy to change it, remove it, or restrict access to it (subject to technical feasibility) in order to protect the integrity of the personal information.
Where you follow a link from Pronti’s application or site to a third party’s site, you are, upon being connected to such site, subject to the third party’s privacy policy, not Pronti’s. For the purposes of this privacy policy, such third party site will be considered out of Pronti’s purview, and any information that you may transmit to such third party will not be governed by this privacy policy. It is solely your responsibility to review and become comfortable with such third party’s policies, including their privacy policy.
You contact Pronti directly
When you contact any Pronti employee by telephone, e-mail, in person, or through our website, you will be asked to provide consent to the collection of personal information if your personal information will help us deliver the information, products, or services you require.
You respond to communications from Pronti
From time to time, Pronti may invite you to provide us with information for specific purposes. We may ask for this information through feedback features on our website or software; we may send out e-mail inviting feedback or offering products and services; or we may ask you for information concerning support of our products or services. Your response to these communications may require you to submit personal information and opinions.
Your information is obtained through a third party
Occasionally, Pronti will obtain information about you from third parties, such as mailing list providers, third party service providers, ISPs, or third party application or account providers. Third-party providers are responsible for obtaining consent for the release of personal information to us from those individuals identified on mailing lists, surveys, or through other collection methods.
Sharing your personal information
Subject to any exceptions stated above in the collection of information section, should Pronti collect any of your personal information, we will follow these practices regarding the distribution of that information.
Your personal information is protected
Pronti uses reasonable precautions to protect personal information and store it securely. Access to your personal information is restricted to those personnel who need it, and Pronti takes reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information.
Pronti only uses and discloses your personal information if it helps us facilitate your needs, provide you with the services, improve our products and services, meet legal and regulatory requirements, or — to the limited extent possible — manage our internal business operations. Additionally, if there are any disclosure or use restrictions in your consent to the collection of your personal information, Pronti will abide by those restrictions (subject to the consent exceptions listed below).
For example, your credit card information will only be used to bill you for the services that you have authorized or used. User and account information provided as part of your registration or preferences for Pronti’s services will only be used to provide you with the services.
Pronti may combine your information with other information into an anonymized form so that it no longer personally identifies you. This includes the anonymization of URLs, unique IDs of installed applications, user IP addresses, and environment-specific information. We may then disclose this anonymized data to third parties for purposes such as improving our services, understanding usage patterns, and other business-related activities. These third parties are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of this anonymized data.
GDPR and PIPEDA Compliance
For users located in jurisdictions where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) apply, Pronti ensures that all collected data, including URLs, unique IDs of installed applications, user IP addresses, and other environment-specific information, is processed in compliance with applicable data protection laws. This includes obtaining explicit consent for data collection, processing, and sharing, and ensuring that any data shared with third parties is anonymized in a manner that meets GDPR and PIPEDA standards to prevent re-identification. Users have the right to withdraw consent at any time, request access to their data, and request the deletion of their data, subject to legal obligations.
We only share your information with your consent
Pronti provides your personal information to third parties only for purposes to which you have consented – which consent shall be deemed with respect to any third party links that you access through Pronti’s services, solely to the extent necessary to access those links - and we otherwise require such third parties to keep your information confidential.
In a few situations, Pronti may be required to disclose your information without your prior consent. For example, Pronti may disclose your information if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to:
• comply with law or legal process
• protect and defend our rights and property, or the rights and property of a third party
• protect against misuse or unauthorized use of any of Pronti’s products, software, services, or other proprietary materials
• protect the personal safety of any person
• allow for a change of ownership of Pronti and associated transfer of all personal information to the new owner of Pronti – this does not affect the protection of your information under this Privacy Policy
Pronti will always try to provide you with prior notice of such disclosure; however, such notice may not always be possible or reasonable given the circumstances.
Google Gmail API
Pronti has an optional feature where you can connect your Gmail account and we can find the images of the items that you purchased online and add them to your closet. Pronti looks through the emails to find a purchase receipt email and then takes the image(s) to display to you in the app. Pronti does not save your emails. Pronti also does not maintain a connection to your email, so if you purchase again after connecting and want your newest purchases to be added to your closet, you need to actively connect again.
Pronti’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the
Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
Advertising and Third-Party Ad Networks
Use of Advertising Services:
We partner with third-party advertising networks, such as Google AdMob, Google Ad Manager, Mediavine, Meta, AppLovin or InMobi to display advertisements within our application. These third parties may use technologies like cookies, mobile identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID or Apple’s ID for Advertising), and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your device and your use of our app over time. The collected data may include your IP address, device type, app usage information, and interactions with the ads displayed, among other details.
Data Use and Personalization:
The information collected may be used to show you targeted advertisements that are more relevant to you. For example, these networks may use data about apps you’ve installed, or the content you’ve viewed, to determine which ads are likely to be of interest. This process is often called interest-based advertising or targeted advertising.
Opting Out of Personalized Ads:
You can opt out of personalized ads at any time by adjusting your device-level advertising preferences. On Android devices, you can reset your Advertising ID and/or opt out of ad personalization under Settings > Google > Ads. On iOS devices, you can limit ad tracking in your device’s privacy settings. Keep in mind that opting out of personalized advertising does not mean you will no longer see ads; it only means that these ads will not be customized to your interests.
Third-Party Policies:
Our advertising partners have their own privacy policies and practices which govern their use of the information they collect. We encourage you to review their policies. For example, you can learn more about how Google uses data at https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads.
Data Sharing and Compliance:
We ensure that any third-party advertisers and partners we work with adhere to applicable data protection laws (such as GDPR and CCPA), and we only share anonymized or non-personally identifiable information with them where required. Users in certain jurisdictions may have additional rights to access, rectify, or restrict the processing of their personal data used for advertising purposes. Please refer to the “User Rights and Consent” section of this Privacy Policy for more details on how to exercise these rights.
Maintaining your personal information
Pronti has established the following practices regarding the maintenance of your personal information.
User Rights and Consent
Users have the right to be informed about the specific data being collected and how it will be used. Pronti will obtain explicit consent for the collection of URLs, unique IDs of installed applications, user IP addresses, and other environment-specific information. This consent will be obtained during the registration process and can be managed through the user’s account settings. Users may withdraw their consent at any time, request access to the data collected about them, or request the deletion of this data, except where retention is required by law.
Data Anonymization Process
Pronti employs industry-standard anonymization techniques to ensure that any data shared with third parties cannot be used to re-identify individual users. This process includes removing or masking direct identifiers, applying encryption, and using aggregation methods where appropriate. The effectiveness of these anonymization techniques is regularly reviewed and updated to meet evolving standards under GDPR and PIPEDA. Users will be notified of any significant changes to the anonymization process that could impact their data privacy.
You can request access to your personal information at any time
If, for any reason, you wish to review your personal information that Pronti has in its possession, you can contact our Privacy Officer, who will be pleased to provide you with all your personal information that Pronti has on file.
You can request changes to your personal information at any time
Sometimes, it will be necessary for you to update your personal information Pronti has on file. For example, if you move or change credit cards, or change your mobile device, you must update your information in order to keep receiving the services provided by Pronti.
If you wish to make any changes or corrections to your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer who will implement the changes. This will help us ensure our records are always up-to-date.
You can opt out of communications at any time
Additionally, you always have the choice of whether you wish to receive information – such as e-mail updates – from Pronti. In some cases, you may do so simply by changing the preferences in the software application through which Pronti provides the services.
If you do choose to opt out of communications respecting products and services provided by Pronti, you may not obtain all the benefits we could otherwise provide, such as updates or warnings. Pronti will not have any liability to you for your loss of those benefits or any negative effects respecting your use of Pronti’s products or services.
You can request that your personal information be destroyed at any time
A situation may arise where you desire to have all of your personal information that is contained in Pronti’s records deleted or destroyed. If this is what you wish, please contact our Privacy Officer, who will take care of removing your personal information from all of Pronti’s records. However, there may be situations where we are obligated to retain one archival copy of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal processes. We will inform you of all such situations, and will only use your retained personal information to the limited extent necessary to comply with such laws or respond to legal processes.
Contacting our Privacy Officer
Pronti welcomes your comments about this privacy policy, and we would be happy to provide any additional information you require. Please
contact our Privacy Officer
.
This privacy policy supplements any agreements you already have with Pronti, such as your User Agreement or website terms and conditions. Our privacy policy does not replace the terms of those agreements. By agreeing to those terms and using Pronti’s website, products, software and services, you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information by Pronti in accordance with this privacy policy. This policy was written in accordance with the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).
