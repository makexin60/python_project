XCWeather Mobile App Privacy Policy
The privacy of XCWeather users is very important to us.
This page explains what types of information we receive when you use the XCWeather app, and how we safeguard that information.  We never sell personal information to third parties.
Geolocation
When you click the 'Current Location' button we ask your phone for your location so that we can display a local forecast.
If you do not use the 'Current Location' button we will never request your location. You can also turn off the location services for XCWeather in your mobile phone settings.
User Preferences
We store your preferences on the phone. We also store your selected forecast locations. You can remove locations at any time by swiping left on the location and using the delete button.
Third party advertising
To pay the bills at XCWeather we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you use our app.
These advertisers use their own tracking systems so that they know how many people have seen a particular ad. They may also display advertising about goods and services that might be of interest to you based on your use of other websites and applications.
For more information about ad personalisation and your options to control it, you can click on the AdChoices icon at the top right of each advert.
Log Files
When you request a forecast, information about that request is written to our log files. The information in the log files includes IP address, device type, time of the visit and which forecasts were requested. This information allows us to find errors and know which services are most popular. These logs are deleted after 14 days.
