What kind of personal data is being collected?
We respect your privacy, therefore, the use of our apps is anonymous. We do not create user profiles and do not allow other people to access your data. When you use our app Apple and Google gather anonymous statistical data that can be accessed by us through their app store platforms. Apple allows you to object the collection of this data.
When you contact us via e-mail, you submit personal data. We store your e-mails and all contained information (e.g. name, e-mail address, telephone number) only for the purpose of answering your inquiries and to fulfill legal requirements. We will delete your e-mails as soon as they are no longer needed. We do not share your personal information. If you revoke your consent to the storage of your data, we will, of course, immediately delete your personal data, unless the deletion precludes mandatory statutory retention periods.
What are the purposes of processing data?
We only collect data that is necessary to ensure a correct function of our apps and that is necessary to answer your support queries (legal basis Art. 6(1), f) GDPR). We fully respect your privacy and do neither evaluate personalized data nor allow other people to access data.
HealthKit integration
Some of our apps allow you to share nutrition data from your food diary with Apple HealthKit. This feature requires you to enable the option for sharing data with Apple Health first. We access your data solely for the purpose of transferring it to Apple Health. We do not store your Apple Health data, and it is not disclosed to third parties. Sharing data is optional. If the option is inactive, no data will be transferred to HealthKit. This does not limit the functionality of the app in any way.
