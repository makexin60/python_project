Personal Information We Collect About You
Generic ID and Authorizations
Our App never collects or otherwise extracts your name, email, username, handle, phone number, or any of your other personal identifiers that you may use to identify yourself.
When you install the App, a randomly generated unique identifier (“Generic ID”) is used to distinguish your installation of the App from installations of the App by other users. Additionally, upon installation, you will be explicitly asked to grant the App permission to access your device’s usage data and accessibility services (the “Accessible Data”). Accessibility services are used to capture the ads being displayed in your social media feeds and collect stats on which websites you visit. The Accessible Data may include information that may be used to personally identify you. However, we only collect the data listed in the Collected Data section below and we never store or index any of the Collected Data in association with your personal identity.
