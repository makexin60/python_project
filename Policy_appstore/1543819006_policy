By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to its collection, use and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of MX Locker.
This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the privacy practices of MX Locker Inc. with respect to information, including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data"), that we collect about individuals ("you" and/or "your") through or our website

, the MX Locker mobile applications, and as a result of providing you with certain other services that we own or control and which posts or links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services"). MX Locker may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products, services, or promotions that we offer at the time we collect personal information. These supplemental privacy policies will govern how we may process the information in the context of the specific product, service, or promotion.
MX Locker, Inc. owns and operates a marketplace that connects buyers, sellers, owners and renters of motorcycles. The purpose of our marketplace is to share the information you provide as an interested buyer or renter with those specific third-party sellers or owners you identify.
If you buy an ad on our marketplace to sell a motorcycle, you will be required to provide certain personal information to MX Locker to complete the transaction, as well as to protect both you and potential buyers/sellers from fraud. This additional personal information may include payment data (such as credit card information), or detailed information about you including your driver’s license, proof of ownership, or social security number. As disclosed below, we do not obtain, store, or tie this additional personal data to your MX Locker account or marketplace activity nor does this information get shared in detail with the sellers or owners.
Information We Collect
When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect the following Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for or use our Services. This information may include:
Contact information, such as your first and last name, email and mailing addresses, and phone number.
Profile information, such as your username and password that you may set to establish an online account with us, your photograph, interests, and brand preferences.

Payment information, such as financial account numbers, payment card information, details regarding payments you make through the Services, and your billing address.
Usage information, such as information about how you use the Services and interact with us, including information associated with any content you upload to the websites or otherwise submit to us, and information you provide when you use any interactive features of the Services.
Marketing information, such as your preferences for receiving communications from us, and details about how you engage with our communications.
Other information that we may collect which is not specifically listed here, but which we will use in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.
Cookies and Other Information Collected by Automated Means: We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and activity occurring on or through the Services. The information that may be collected automatically includes your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device identifier (such as the Google Advertising ID, Apple ID for Advertising, or other identifier that we may generate), browser type, screen resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our website, general location information such as city, state or geographic area; and information about your use of and actions on the Services, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access. Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites and mobile applications.
On our webpages, this information is collected using cookies, browser web storage (also known as locally stored objects, or “LSOs”), Flash-based LSOs (also known as “Flash cookies”), web beacons, and similar technologies, and our emails may also contain web beacons. In our mobile application, we may collect this information directly or through our use of third-party software development kits (“SDKs”). SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly through our mobile application.
A “cookie” is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. Browser web storage or LSOs, are used for similar purposes as cookies. “Web beacons” are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Services or in emails relating to the Services to collect certain personally non-identifiable information and monitor user activity on the Services, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon or whether certain content was viewed. A SDK is third-party computer code that we may incorporate into our mobile applications that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, or to facilitate online advertising.
We may also use Flash LSO on our website to collect and store information about your use of our website. Unlike cookies, Flash LSOs cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of Flash applications that we may use in connection with our website.
On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services features.
