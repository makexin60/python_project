Aggregated information
We may share aggregated, anonymized information which cannot be used to identify you, within the app, on our website or our various social media platforms. We can share this information in formats including but not limited to: articles, publications, statistics and social media posts.
Information posted by you
Our website and social media platforms have areas where you can share information with us and other users. These communities are open to the public and should not be considered private. You should think carefully before posting personal information in these public forums. What you post can be seen and collected by third parties and used by others in ways that SnoreGym cannot control or predict, including unauthorised contact. This information may also show up on search engines. If you accidentally post personal information on these platforms and would like it removed please email us on
support@snoregym.com
to request we remove it. In some cases, for technical reasons, we may not be able to remove such information.
Special circumstances
We will not share or sell any of your personal data to any third party except as otherwise stated within this Privacy Policy and in the following circumstances:
In response to legal processes to the extent permitted and as restricted by law (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements);
When disclosure is required to keep the security and integrity of the app, or to protect any user’s security consistent with applicable laws;
When disclosure is permitted by the user who has input the personal data;
In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or some of its assets, your information will, in most instances, be part of these assets.
Retention of your personal data
We may retain certain personal information in an aggregated and anonymized format after your account has been deleted. We reserve the right to use your information in any aggregated form after you have deleted your account, but will ensure that the use of this information will not personally identify you.
Any social media posts or comments made to us on any platform may remain visible after you terminate your account; we are not obliged to remove these.
We may also retain some information to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, support business operations and continue to improve our services. For our service improvement purposes, we will take steps to ensure this information doesn’t identify you and will only use it to gain aggregated insights into the services we provide.
Security of data
Steps we take to protect your information
Giving due consideration to the potentially sensitive nature of the data we collect, we take steps to protect all of the collected personal data from loss, theft, misuse, disclosure, unauthorised access, alteration and deletion. We use various security measures to protect your personal information, including encryption of personal data and storage on computer systems that have restricted access.
Breaches
No security system is perfect so we cannot guarantee complete security of the app or that your information won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us. In the event of a security systems breach we may either publish a general notice or attempt to notify you by email. We will then take the necessary steps to remedy the breach.
Collection of data from children
By its nature, our app is unlikely to attract children aged sixteen (16) years old or younger, and we do not intentionally market to or interact with them. If you believe that a child under 16 has provided personal data to SnoreGym, please contact our support team on
support@snoregym.com
and we will aim to delete this information.
