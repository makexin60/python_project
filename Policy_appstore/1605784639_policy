We are Intergiro Intl AB (publ), a Swedish fintech company licensed and supervised by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw.

Partner Platform
”) to jointly provide you with the best services possible. Intergiro provides payment services and the Partner provides you with the Partner Platform through which you access and use the payment services.
You sign up with the Partner and using the Partner Platform you apply to become a customer of Intergiro to utilise the payment services, generally you are provided with a payment account and a payment card.

Why we process your personal data
According to the GDPR we need to have a purpose and a legal basis for the processing of your personal data. Read more about our purpose for processing your personal data below.
At Intergiro, the legal basis for processing your personal data is either:
the agreement you have, or is about to enter into, with us by accepting the Payment Services Terms and Conditions in the Partner Platform or, the agreement you have, or is about to enter into, with the Partner by accepting the Partner’s terms and conditions;
legal obligations we are bound by, such as anti-money laundering regulations; or
our legitimate interest, such as providing customer support or keeping you informed about product updates.
In very rare cases we may also process your personal data if we have received your explicit consent to do so. In such case you can always withdraw your consent at any time.
We use the personal data we collect for the following purposes:
the administration and management of our relationship with you, such as setting up your payment account on our payment services platform and keeping you informed about product updates, managing your queries and solving any issues you experience if any during the performance of payment services provided by Intergiro

How we work with automated decision-making
We are using automated decision-making when you apply to become a customer of Intergiro through the Partner Platform. Automated decision-making enables us to provide both a more consistent and fair decision-making process where the risk of potential human errors are reduced and a faster review of your application and onboarding process. The automated decision is based on both (i) data provided directly by you (such as answers to our questions) and (ii) derived or inferred data, such as risk scoring.
We will automatically reject your application if you are below the age of 18, and otherwise we only use automated decision-making to approve your application. If required, your application will be referred for manual review by our onboarding team.
In addition, you can always request a manual decision-making process instead, express your opinion or contest decisions based solely on automated processing. If you want to exercise your rights, please contact our data privacy team at privacy@intergiro.com.

With whom we share your personal data
As electronic money institutions are subject to statutory requirements for professional secrecy and confidentiality, we only share your personal data in certain specific cases.
In order to provide the payment services to you we share personal data with our trusted partners that process personal data on our behalf. We will therefore share personal data with the Partner, who acts as our processor, in order for you to access and use the payment services in the Partner Platform and for the purposes of providing the first line customer support to you.
We also share data with our other trusted third party service providers, who act as our processors:
Suppliers of payment processing services
Payment card personalisation bureau (if you have applied for a physical payment card)
Suppliers of identification services
Suppliers of screening services to prevent anti-money laundering, fraud and similar crimes
Suppliers of IT systems and cloud services
We have carefully reviewed our service providers and secured that their processing of your personal data is compliant with EU standards and the GDPR.

the Partner, for any specific purpose as further described in the Partner’s terms & conditions and the Partner’s privacy policy
○ The legal basis is the agreement you have entered into with the Partner
our correspondent banks, for example regarding execution of pay-outs to beneficiaries, holding client funds and to safeguard legal interests

○ The legal basis is the agreement you have entered into with us
authorities, such as the Financial Police and the Financial Supervisory Authority, if such a disclosure is prescribed by law
○ The legal basis is our obligations under mandatory law
As Intergiro provides international payment services, we are sometimes required to share personal data with parties operating outside the EU. In these cases, we ensure that the data is transferred in accordance with the applicable requirements of the GDPR, primarily the standard contract clauses (SCC) and complementary safety measures, or if available, other means in compliance with the GDPR.
If Intergiro engages in a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, or sale of some or all of Intergiro’s assets or shares, financing, initial public offering or similar transactions or proceedings, or steps in contemplation of such activities (such as due diligence), Intergiro may share personal data with third parties, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements.

About Ad Settings
We and our 1 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.
Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest.
View our list of partners
to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
Purposes
2
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data. You can object to legitimate interest processing per purpose.
Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.

2. What is personal data and what does the processing of personal data mean?
Personal data refers to any kind of information that can be directly or indirectly related to an identified/identifiable natural person. The processing of personal data covers all operations that are performed on the personal data, whether actively or passively, for the means of e.g., collection, registrations, storage, alteration, erasure etc (cf Art 4 (2) GDPR).
3. Who is responsible for the personal data processing?

For example, Finshark may collect information directly from you to perform KYC on you in accordance with our legal obligation under the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Act. See section 5 below for more information.
Most of our customers are business entities, which means that Finshark may in such circumstances act as a data processor.

statutory obligations
for the processing of your information.
Website visits, cookies and browsing behaviour
Such as device and/or behaviour information, including but not limited to:
• IP-address
• Operating systems and browser details
• Type of device
• Interactions with our websites
We collect this type of information for two different reasons:
a) We automatically collect information that is necessary for enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of our platforms.

Our third-party contractors, such as for advertising and analytics, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices.

Cookie policy
.
The processing of such personal information is based on our
legitimate interest
in offering our Services to you and communicating news or updates on our products and business.
Additionally, this information will also help us to administer, personalize and improve our website for you.
Sensitive information
Depending on the information you provide to us in relation to the purposes of the processing, as set out in this Privacy Policy, Finshark may collect sensitive personal information as defined in Article 9 of the GDPR.
Finshark may also process such sensitive information in relation to, for example, the purpose of checking your personal information against lists of politically exposed persons (“PEP”) and lists of persons subject to sanctions.
Such sensitive information may include personal information that reveals racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political or philosophical opinions, trade union membership, or information about health or sexual orientation.
Sensitive information is collected and processed to comply with our
statutory obligations
as a payment service provider.
Please note that we may process your personal data for other means and purposes than those described in this Privacy Policy. If this is the case, we ensure to provide you with a separate privacy statement informing you about such processing and for what purposes.
5. How long do we store your personal data?
We will only process and store your personal data for as long as we need to fulfil the purpose for which the data was collected. The duration of time we retain your information depends on who you are and which services you use. For example,
Personal data will generally not be stored for a period longer than seven (7) years to fulfil accounting obligations.
Another example is Finshark’s Anti-Money Laundering obligation to document information regarding transactions, and from our ‘Know Your Customer’ processes for five to ten (5-10) years;
Cookies and similar data are kept as you use the same device or until you opt-out from the use of cookies and similar technologies.
Other personal data collected for research or statistical purposes may be kept for as long as you permit us, you’re a customer to us, and/or so long as Finshark has a legitimate interest.
Finshark has implemented various technical and organisational measures, such as automated deletion of data and access restriction to systems where personal data is stored, to ensure that the data is not used for a longer period than necessary to fulfil the respective purpose the data was collected for.
6. Who do we share your personal data with?
We mainly share your personal information with our customers whose services you use and to whom you have instructed us to share your data. Personal information we share with our customers is only such as is required for us to be able to deliver the service to you.
In some situations, we may share your information with third parties. When we share your personal data with a personal data processor, your personal data will only be processed in accordance with the purposes for which we collected your personal data in the first place. This means that a personal data processor cannot process your personal data for additional or personal purposes. We have a personal data processor agreement in place with these parties to ensure that your personal data is protected in the same way as if we processed your personal data ourselves.
We may also share your personal information with authorities to comply with our obligations related to preventing crimes and money laundering
.
7. Where do we process and store your personal data?
Finshark processes and stores your personal data primarily within the EU/ EES. Our company is based in Sweden and has a subsidiary in Bosnia which means that we’re mainly operating within Europe.
In exceptional cases, your personal data may be processed outside the EU/EES. For example, if our personal data processor, either individually or through another personal data processor/sub-processor, is established outside the EU/EES.
Regardless of the country in which your personal data is processed, we undertake necessary measures to ensure that your personal data is protected with a high level of security that is appropriate to the risks associated with the processing and maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect it.

8.2 Right to rectification/correction

If the personal data is incorrect and Finshark needs time to verify the accuracy of the data.
If you object to the processing or request the restriction of the use performed by Finshark, in which case the processing shall be limited until the justification for your objection and Finshark’s compelling reasons have been assessed.
If the personal data is no longer needed for Finshark’s activities, you request that it continues to be stored in case it is needed to make legal claims.
If you believe that Finshark should delete your personal data but Finshark for some reason is unable to accommodate your request.
