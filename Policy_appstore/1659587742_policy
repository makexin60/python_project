PERSONAL INFORMATION
We do not collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email, telephone number, geolocation, or IP address. The Service works entirely anonymously, so we do not keep logs or monitor your online activity.
COOKIES
We use cookies to improve our service performance continuously. Cookies help us remember your settings to provide the best user experience. You are free to disable cookies in your device settings, but this may make some features of the Service not available.
As we use third-party analytics services like Firebase and Google Analytics, you should be aware that they may also use cookies. You can read through their policies here: https://policies.google.com/privacy. In addition, the stats data we get from the analytics service is used in a way it cannot be connected to individual users.

SECURITY
We use reliable administrative and tech security methods to protect information we may collect for statistics and app improvement reasons. Our servers are housed in data centers where robust security practices are applied. Although we do our best to ensure safe and secure Service, you should be aware that, on the Internet, no data security measures can provide total protection.
