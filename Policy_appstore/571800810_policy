Data Transfer
Calm is based in the United States and has operations there and in other countries. As a result, we and our service providers process information in countries which may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. Where required by law, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal data in accordance with applicable law, such as by obtaining your consent, relying on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions, or executing Standard Contractual Clauses. Where relevant, you may request a copy of these Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing us at
support@calm.com
.
Privacy Rights
You may update certain account information (such as your password, name, and email address) by logging into your account, contacting us through our

correct information we have about you;
opt out of “sales”, targeted advertising, or “sharing”; and
delete the information we have about you.
