Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy shall apply to the applications published in the Apple App Store by AnyDay Apps (“OnPhone,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and that
            are accessible from mobile devices and personal computers (the "App"), and the use of the websites controlled
            by AnyDay Apps in general (the "Website"; App, and Website together the "Services").
Overview
This Privacy Policy describes how OnPhone treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of OnPhone’s products, services, and websites. Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide and improve our products and services.
Children’s Personal Information
All OnPhone products, services and websites are not intended for children under the age of 13, so children under the age of 13 should not use them at any time.
OnPhone does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. In the event that OnPhone discovers that it has received personal information from a child under the age of 13, OnPhone will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.
Information OnPhone Collects and Uses
OnPhone collects information when you use and access OnPhone’s products, services and website. We categorize the information we collect into three categories (collectively referred to as “Customer Information”): Personal Information, App Data and Share Data.
Must be clear that end user’s personal info will not be shared or sold to third parties for the purpose of marketing. For example - ‘No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.’
“Personal Information” is information about you that is personally identifiable, including your full name, business or residential address, email address, land-line or existing mobile phone number, or billing information.
“App Data” is information about the nature of your usage of OnPhone’s website and products and services and non-personal information. App Data can include: IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system information, unique device identifiers, such as UDID and/or Ethernet MAC address, date/time stamp, clickstream data and information about actions taken by you through interaction with OnPhone’s products and/or advertising displayed within OnPhone products, messages sent and received using OnPhone services, information about those messages (date, duration, recipients, size, attachments), type of device, location information, age, gender, type of web browser, one or more cookies that identify your browser, and telecommunications carrier information.
“Share Data” is data and information you provide for use with OnPhone’s products or services, such as text, audio, and photos you make available through the Apps or contacts you add or import for use with OnPhone products, and which may be made available to third parties by your actions when using OnPhone products or services.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
OnPhone uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the OnPhone services by processing such information for various purposes, including improving and providing OnPhone’s products and services, product notifications, delivering advertisements and related links, for sending, sharing and storing your Share Data as you direct through use of OnPhone products and services, and other purposes relating to offering you OnPhone products and services.
If you provide your phone number as part of a request for information about OnPhone products or services or in setting up an account, we may use that phone number and share that phone number with third parties to contact you about OnPhone products and services and to provide advertisements to you about OnPhone Products and services.
OnPhone does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information except as provided above and unless: you initiate the sharing through the OnPhone products, services or website; you have provided your express consent; and in the following circumstances:
(i) OnPhone may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail, SMS, MMS, and voice communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.
(ii) OnPhone may share App Data and certain aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, but such information does not include your name, email address or any other Personal Information.
(iii) OnPhone may share Customer Information to respond to legal requirements, when legally required to do so, or at the request of governmental authorities.
(iv) OnPhone may share Customer Information to verify or enforce compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against fraud, to detect and prevent security or technical issues, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the OnPhone products, services, computing systems, or website, or to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of OnPhone, its subscribers or the public.
(v) OnPhone may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization provided that use of Customer Information is in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
(vi) OnPhone may share your Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from that third party through OnPhone products or services. Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such user information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreements with you, if any, as well as their own privacy policies and as authorized and agreed upon by you as part of agreements for use of our products and services. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and privacy policies. You acknowledge that OnPhone shall have no liability to you for sharing of such information to such third parties as authorized by you and OnPhone disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. If OnPhone desires to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use for those other purposes.
Cookies and Tracking
When you visit OnPhone or use OnPhone applications, we may send cookies to your computer that uniquely identify your browser or use tracking pixels, agents or other visitor identification technology (collectively, “Tags”) that collect App Data.

Customer Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is accessible only by authorized OnPhone personnel, contractors, and agents bound by confidentiality obligations and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Our processing of Personal Information is only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Periodically, OnPhone undertakes a review of its privacy practices to ensure that that the information we collect is needed to provide or improve the services we provide.
Links to Third Party Sites

Privacy Notice
SOME USEFUL DATA PRIVACY FACTS FROM YOUR FRIENDS AT ONPHONE
We’ve provided this Privacy Notice to help you understand how Anyday Apps, Inc. (“OnPhone,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects and uses personal information and, for California residents, to inform them of the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which the categories of personal information will be used, as required under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).
The technologies we use process data for our products and services are complicated, but this Privacy Notice is meant to provide you with an easy-to-understand overview of the categories of personal information we collect, why we collect them, and how we use them. While this Privacy Notice provides a general overview, for a complete understanding about what personal information we gather and how we use it, please review our
Privacy Policy
and
Terms of Service
. Also, please review our “Notice of Financial Incentive” included below.
What does OnPhone do?
OnPhone offers software applications for iOS and Android mobile devices (and limited versions of those applications for internet-connected desktop computers), that enable end users to send SMS and MMS communications as well as to place or receive calls. OnPhone licenses its applications to U.S.-based end users for use in the U.S. OnPhone’s Canadian subsidiary, Dinopilot, offers the some of the same applications and functionality in limited markets outside of the U.S. If you’re an end user licensed by Dinopilot, references to “OnPhone,” “we,” “us,” or “our” in this Privacy Notice mean Dinopilot.
OnPhone’s mobile applications are: “OnPhone,” “OnPhone App” (collectively, the “Apps”). The Apps are available in iOS and/or Android versions for tablets and smartphones and are distributed through Apple’s “App Store” and the “Google Play” store (collectively, “App Stores”). OnPhone are supported by advertising revenue and are free to use, with certain additional features available for purchase, including a “Remove Ads” feature that allows end users to purchase a subscription for an ad-free version.
OnPhone Apps provide end users with access to a OnPhone-supplied phone number that becomes associated with an end user’s account. Receiving and sending SMS and MMS messages through the OnPhone Apps are paid to users as are inbound calls. However, placing outbound calls requires end users to either purchase license credits for outbound calling through App Stores, or earn license credits for outbound calling by viewing video ads (each ad view typically equates to one minute of license credits) or completing third party offers.
What personal information does OnPhone need to use?
In order for inbound or outbound calls and messages to work for our OnPhone Apps, we need basic information about the sender and the recipient, namely their phone numbers. We also need to know how to associate all those calls and messages with a specific account for those Apps, so we require you to provide some basic information during signup. That’s how we can make sure that calls and messages are connected correctly. That information is required in order for us to provide our services, so please keep that in mind when deciding whether to use our Apps.
Since our OnPhone Apps are supported by advertising, we -like other ad-supported companies (e.g. Facebook) – gather information about you, your mobile device from the OnPhone Apps, and your use of OnPhone Apps. That information is shared with Advertising Companies who process it and match it with other data and use algorithms to serve ads that are more relevant to you. That’s basically how we, and others, make money to support and offer OnPhone Apps for free.
Can I opt out of the sale of my personal information?
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), provision of personal information to our advertising service providers may constitute a “sale” of that information, so for CCPA purposes, we consider that we “sell” your personal information to deliver ads in our OnPhone Apps. If you don’t like that personal information is used to deliver ads to you in our OnPhone Apps, then you can opt out by purchasing a “Remove Ads” subscription from the applicable Apps Stores, which you may do within the “settings” feature of your OnPhone App.
NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE:
If you’re a California resident, you should know that the “Remove Ads” feature is offered in compliance with Section 1798.125(a)(2) of the CCPA which allows us to charge a fee if we can’t generate any advertising revenue from your use of the OnPhone Apps. That fee is a good faith estimate of the value of the advertising revenue for a typical user of the OnPhone Apps as determined by an industry standard calculation of lifetime value of a user who views our ads as compared to the lifetime value of a typical user who purchases “Remove Ads.”
When you purchase a “Remove Ads” subscription, we stop providing your personal information to Advertising Companies, but you have to maintain that subscription in order to prevent the use of your personal information for advertising purposes. If you wish to cancel your “Remove Ads” subscription as a financial incentive to not have your Personal Information sold, you will have to do so from the Apple or Google Play store. If you cancel or let the “Remove Ads” subscription lapse, then your personal information will be used for advertising in the OnPhone Apps and, by allowing the subscription to lapse, you are expressly consenting to our use of your personal information for advertising within the OnPhone Apps.
Remember that purchasing a “Remove Ads” subscription for OnPhone Apps is the only way for you to opt out of our sale of your personal information if you still want to use our OnPhone Apps.
Contacts Permission Request
OnPhone accesses your contacts to allow you to easily call and text with your friends and family.
OnPhone collects numbers and names of your contacts to let you enjoy calling and texting with those who are also using our app by auto-matching phone numbers from contacts.
Your contacts wii be encrypted, uploaded and securely stored in the OnPhone Server and will never be shared with 3rd parties. You can delete these data by deactivating the account or contacting us.
What categories of third parties does OnPhone engage?
While OnPhone maintains its own data servers for the core data management for the Apps, we engage third parties to provide other services, as follows: (i) .”Backend Providers” provide the backend transmission systems necessary for the Apps to function and include local exchange carriers connected to the PSTN (Public Switch Telephone Network) who connect communications for us, data backhaul providers who transfer data across the continent, and hosting providers; (ii) “Service Providers” who provide analytics, calendar, user notification, and related business services and customer support platforms; and (iii) “Advertising Companies” who provide advertising services for our OnPhone Apps. We have contractual agreements with those third parties that limit the use of personal information for the specific purpose identified in those agreements.
What categories of personal information does OnPhone collect?
Some data we collect from our Apps and our websites at
onphone.app
, is “personal information” under the CCPA because it identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device. Currently, we collect this information from you and your device. Since paid features of our Apps are purchased through App Stores, we don’t collect any financial information from you, but we do collect other categories of personal information.
Below is a summary of the categories of personal information we may have collected from consumers within the last twelve (12) months and the main purpose for its collection. Please note that we only collect personal information from you when you use our Apps, the Site or interact with our customer support personnel. Also, not all the information identified below is collected from every end user.

We disclose your personal information to Back End Providers to enable communications transmissions for our Apps. We disclose your personal information to Services Providers to provide customer support, to analyze the usage of our Apps and the Site, and to initiate App alerts. And we disclose your personal information to Advertising Companies to serve ads to our OnPhone Apps.
We will not collect additional categories of personal information from you or use it differently than as described unless we provide you with advance notice and obtain your consent.
What about personal information from users under the age of 16?
Where users of our OnPhone Apps have indicated that they are under the age of 16, we don’t sell their personal information and their account is terminated.
What are other uses of personal information?
As noted above, we use personal information to provide our services and, for OnPhone Apps, to serve ads. In addition, we may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:
To fulfill or meet the reason for which the information is provided. For example, if you contact our customer support, we may use your email address to communicate with you about your support issue:
* To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.
* To provide you with alerts and other notices concerning our products or services.
* To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights under the Apps’ Terms of Service.
* For testing, research, analysis and product development to improve our Apps and Site.
* To protect the rights, property or safety of us, our subscribers or others and to respond to legal requests.
* As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.
* For the other purposes set forth in our Privacy Policy.
Where is the data held?
OnPhone utilizes data centers in the United States, where all of our necessary systems are located. Some of our support programs leverage affiliated companies in the European Union (EU) to provide customer support, and those European-based customer support teams may have remote access to account information, but they do not store that information. Transfers of personal data to and among our affiliates are subject to terms of intercompany agreements governing the transfer of data to the United States and protection of that data under applicable law. Also, we require that you acknowledge and agree to allow us to transfer data to the United States, so if you’re not willing to provide that consent, you shouldn’t use our products and services.
What safeguards does OnPhone utilize to protect data?
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures for our systems to comply with data privacy to ensure a level of data protection appropriate to the risk resulting from the processing of personal data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the severity and likelihood of realization of risks for the rights and freedoms of folks who’ve provided the data.
Is OnPhone a “controller” or a “processor”?
Lots of companies are making distinctions between who is a “controller,” and who is a “processor,” when it comes to using personal data. That’s because the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) distinguishes a “controller,” (the party primarily responsible for protecting “personal data”) from a “processor” (which is essentially a subcontractor that has secondary, but important responsibilities to protect “personal data”). In the context of providing services to you, OnPhone would be considered a “controller” if GDPR were to apply. However, currently you are not allowed to use our applications in the EU.
Why do I have to log in and contact you to make CCPA requests?
As noted above, since we don’t require a lot of information for you to use our Apps, and since we may not verify the accuracy of the personal information you provide, we may not have sufficient data to verify who you are unless you log in and contact us using our Apps or provide us with the requested information. If you log in and contact us using our Apps, we can associate your request with a specific account and then take action on your request.
What do I do if I have concerns about the use of my data?
If you have concerns about the use of your data, contact us at
support@anydayapps.com
. Please review our
Privacy Policy
for specific details about what is required of you when you contact us. And please remember that the choice to use our products is entirely yours: if you’re not comfortable with letting us use personal information as described in this Privacy Notice, in our Privacy Policy, and in our Terms of Service, then please don’t download our Apps.
Modifying or Removal of Your Customer Information
If you have subscribed to or purchased Our Products and Services and you wish to remove or modify your information, you can contact Us using the contact information provided below, although you should be aware that (a) there will be a technical delay between your request and the effective removal of your User Data from Our database, (b) we may have to retain Customer Information for legal purposes as the case may be; and (c) certain of Our Products and Services require the use of your information and such data is retained by Us and used as described in this Privacy Policy. You can delete your account and uninstall the OnPhone application from your device. If you need assistance please contact Us at

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

Welcome to the Yahoo Privacy Policy
Last updated: December 2024
About Yahoo
Yahoo, previously known as Verizon Media, is a technology and media company that provides a range of services. We serve our consumers, partners, advertisers and talent through our portfolio of digital platforms, products and services offered under our AOL, Yahoo and other
brands
.
We provide control tools to help you manage your experience with us. If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the
legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy
or
legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL)
still apply to your account. For Yahoo products or services that are accessed without signing in to an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services as of May 25, 2018. If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply starting today.
Except as set out elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, when we refer to ‘Yahoo’, it means Yahoo Inc., the US-established company that supplies the Services to you (and acts as data controller of the personal data Yahoo collects when you use those Services).
Our Privacy Pledge
Our commitment is to put users first. We strive to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, to keep your information secure and to provide you meaningful choices.
This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information Yahoo, its affiliates and its house of global
brands
(“Yahoo,” “us,” “our” or “we”) collect, why we collect it and what we do with it. This policy applies to Yahoo
brands
, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we’ll collectively refer to these as “Services”). Additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in
Details for Specific Products and Services
.
Your Controls
We believe you should have tools to control your information. You can find controls to manage or review your account information, marketing preferences, location data, and search history at
Privacy Controls
. Some of our Services provide additional controls and privacy practices. (
See, Details for Specific Products and Services
)
Information Collection and Use - General
Certain categories of information collected by Yahoo are necessary to use our Services, such as the information you must provide when registering for some Services.
We may collect and combine information when you interact with Yahoo Services information outlined below:
Information You Provide to Us.

here
.
Information Security and Data Retention
Yahoo has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store.
Yahoo will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the applicable Yahoo Services to you. In some cases, Yahoo has certain business or legal requirements that result in an obligation to retain your personal information for an extended period of time. These obligations may include financial record keeping, ensuring continuity of our products or services, security, fraud, and abuse prevention, or compliance with our legal obligations. In some limited cases, we may keep data for longer than needed for the purposes set out in the
Yahoo Privacy Dashboard
, such as: (i) replicating or backing up certain data to “offline” storage for disaster recovery purposes; (ii) truncating, redacting or summarizing raw data, log files and database records into statistical aggregate data or probabilistic data structures to understand long term trends; (iii) maintaining de-identified data for varying periods for research, reporting and product testing or development (in these cases, unique identifiers and linkages to existing data about you are broken or removed so that this data is no longer associated with you, your browser, or device); or (iv) keeping and using certain data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements (for example, we might keep data associated with an account subject to litigation or a request from law enforcement). For specific information about your personal information or how your personal information is processed by a particular Yahoo product or service you may interact with, please log into the
Yahoo Privacy Dashboard
.
Protecting Children’s Privacy
Our Services are for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or share information that could reasonably be used to identify children under age 13 without prior parental consent or consistent with applicable law. With parental permission, a child under age 13 might have a Yahoo Family Account. Visit
Children's Privacy & Family Accounts
to learn more about children’s privacy at Yahoo.
Our Legal Bases for Processing Information.
We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information. First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us. Second, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. Third, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. Occasionally, Yahoo may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user’s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation. Please see our
Legal bases
page for more information.
Data Processing and Transfers
When you use or interact with any of our Services, you consent to the data processing, sharing, transferring and uses of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Regardless of the country where you reside, you authorize us to transfer, process, store and use your information in countries other than your own in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to provide you with Services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside.
Yahoo processes information related to individuals in the EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland and receives that information from the EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland through various compliance mechanisms, including the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. Where appropriate, we also rely on other transfer mechanisms such as data processing agreements based on Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission or the United Kingdom. For more information, please visit our
Data Transfer
page.
The United States and other non-EU/EEA/UK countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information. If you are based in the EU/EEA/UK, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EU/EEA/UK, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.
Other Important Information
This Privacy Policy Applies Only to Yahoo.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some affiliated products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy.
Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should check it periodically. If we make changes that are material we will provide you with appropriate notice before such changes take effect.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Data encryption
Firebase services encrypt data in transit using HTTPS and logically isolate
customer data.
In addition, several Firebase services also encrypt their data at rest:
Cloud Firestore
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Cloud Functions for Firebase
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase Realtime Database
Cloud Storage for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Test Lab
Firebase App Check
Firebase App Distribution
Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
resource identifiers like application IDs and package name/bundle IDs, technical
and operational details of usage such as IP addresses, and direct communications
with developers from feedback and support related conversations.
*Services covered include Firebase A/B Testing, Firebase App Distribution,
  Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Dynamic Links,
  Firebase Hosting, Firebase In-App Messaging, Firebase ML,
  Firebase Performance Monitoring, Firebase Realtime Database,
  Firebase Remote Config, and Firebase User Segmentation Storage.
