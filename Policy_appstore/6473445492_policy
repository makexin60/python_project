14. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS FOR EEA, SWITZERLAND, AND UK
The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and certain other countries' data protection laws provide certain rights for data subjects. If you are a resident of the EEA, Switzerland, the UK, or another country with data protection laws that provide for certain data subject rights, you may submit a request to exercise your rights.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Depending on your country of residence, your rights may include:
Request information
about how we collect, process, use and share your Personal Information (commonly known as a "right to know request").
Request access
to your Personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your Personal Information (commonly known as a "request to be forgotten"). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction
of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer
of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
File a complaint
with a supervisory authority about our collection and processing of your Personal Information.
Exercising Your Rights
These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them. If you are located in the EEA, Switzerland or UK and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights listed above), and Ditto does not discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choice and rights. We will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny our Services to you, charge you different rates, provide a different level or quality of Services to you, or suggest that you may receive such different treatment.
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights).This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please first contact our DPO as described in Section 3.
Please note that if you are an Authorized User, we may forward your request to exercise your rights to the relevant Customer with respect to the information controlled by such Customer.
15. DATA RETENTION AND SECURITY
Data Retention
Your Personal Information is processed for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected, to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and for the duration of any period necessary to establish, exercise or defend any legal rights.
In order to determine the most appropriate retention periods for your Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your information, the reasons for which we collect and process your Personal Information, and applicable legal requirements.
In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your Personal Information instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance. When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the Personal Information can be linked back to you or any specific user.
Data Security
We have put in place reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to prevent your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. For example, we use encryption, secure socket layer, firewalls, and password protection. In addition, we limit access to Personal Information to those employees, agents, contractors and the third parties who have a business need-to-know. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach, and we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where required to do so. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and while we take reasonable steps to provide secure services, by using the or Services, you understand and assume the risks associated with your activities on the internet.
16. EXTERNAL WEBSITES
The Services may contain links to other websites that are not controlled by Ditto ("
External Websites
"). By clicking on links to External Websites, the operators of the External Websites may collect your Personal Information.

17. SOCIAL MEDIA BUTTONS
On or through the Services we may provide third-party "share" buttons which enable you to share certain content via social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn). These "share" buttons may function as web beacons when you interact with the button. Please note that when you "share" using the buttons, you may send to the third party provider of the "share" button the information that you are viewing. If you are not logged into your account with the third party provider, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the Services to your account with the applicable third party provider. Please refer to each third party's privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.

However, Ditto operates globally and may transfer the personal information that we process to our other offices and to the third parties described above. These recipients may be situated outside of your country or regional area of residence and may process personal information outside of your country or regional area. In particular, information provided to us or collected by us likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us or our Affiliates and our respective agents and contractors. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in your country of residence.
We rely on legally-provided mechanisms to transfer personal information across borders where and as required under applicable law.

California residents who have provided us with personal information have the right (under California Civil Code§ 1798.83) to request and obtain from us, once each year, the details of any personal information we shared with a third party for that third party's direct marketing purposes during the prior calendar year.

14. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS FOR EEA, SWITZERLAND, AND UK
The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and certain other countries' data protection laws provide certain rights for data subjects. If you are a resident of the EEA, Switzerland, the UK, or another country with data protection laws that provide for certain data subject rights, you may submit a request to exercise your rights.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Depending on your country of residence, your rights may include:
Request information
about how we collect, process, use and share your Personal Information (commonly known as a "right to know request").
Request access
to your Personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your Personal Information (commonly known as a "request to be forgotten"). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction
of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer
of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
File a complaint
with a supervisory authority about our collection and processing of your Personal Information.
Exercising Your Rights
These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them. If you are located in the EEA, Switzerland or UK and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights listed above), and Ditto does not discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choice and rights. We will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny our Services to you, charge you different rates, provide a different level or quality of Services to you, or suggest that you may receive such different treatment.
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights).This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please first contact our DPO as described in Section 3.
Please note that if you are an Authorized User, we may forward your request to exercise your rights to the relevant Customer with respect to the information controlled by such Customer.
15. DATA RETENTION AND SECURITY
Data Retention
Your Personal Information is processed for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected, to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and for the duration of any period necessary to establish, exercise or defend any legal rights.
In order to determine the most appropriate retention periods for your Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your information, the reasons for which we collect and process your Personal Information, and applicable legal requirements.
In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your Personal Information instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance. When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the Personal Information can be linked back to you or any specific user.
Data Security
We have put in place reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to prevent your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. For example, we use encryption, secure socket layer, firewalls, and password protection. In addition, we limit access to Personal Information to those employees, agents, contractors and the third parties who have a business need-to-know. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach, and we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where required to do so. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and while we take reasonable steps to provide secure services, by using the or Services, you understand and assume the risks associated with your activities on the internet.
16. EXTERNAL WEBSITES
The Services may contain links to other websites that are not controlled by Ditto ("
External Websites
"). By clicking on links to External Websites, the operators of the External Websites may collect your Personal Information.

17. SOCIAL MEDIA BUTTONS
On or through the Services we may provide third-party "share" buttons which enable you to share certain content via social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn). These "share" buttons may function as web beacons when you interact with the button. Please note that when you "share" using the buttons, you may send to the third party provider of the "share" button the information that you are viewing. If you are not logged into your account with the third party provider, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the Services to your account with the applicable third party provider. Please refer to each third party's privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.

However, Ditto operates globally and may transfer the personal information that we process to our other offices and to the third parties described above. These recipients may be situated outside of your country or regional area of residence and may process personal information outside of your country or regional area. In particular, information provided to us or collected by us likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us or our Affiliates and our respective agents and contractors.
