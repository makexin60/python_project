16.3 Facebook Pixel
We use the “Facebook Pixel” from the social network Facebook, operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you are located in the EU, by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”). We also use this tool based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). We use the Facebook Pixel to show you personalized advertising on Facebook and to analyze your user behavior on our website. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by using one of the listed opt-out options.
When you visit our website, the Facebook Pixel is triggered, and a cookie is set on your device (known as a first-party cookie), in which the collected data is stored. In addition, cookies from Facebook and other companies (third-party cookies) are integrated. Furthermore, web beacons and other storage technologies may be used. This places a so-called cookie on your device.
The Facebook Pixel allows us to understand the effectiveness of Facebook ads (“Facebook Ads”) and your interaction with our website for statistical and market research purposes. For instance, the Pixel enables us to see whether you were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook Ad and how you interacted with our website (“conversion”). The Pixel also allows us to define you and other visitors to our website as a target audience for Facebook Ads. In other words, we use the Facebook Pixel to achieve better customer outreach on Facebook. Any Facebook Ads we place are thus only shown to those users who have already shown an interest in our offers or display certain characteristics (e.g. interests in specific topics or products, determined by the websites they have visited, known as “Custom Audiences from Website”). We also aim to ensure that our ads match your interests and do not appear intrusive.
We collect various event and conversion data on our website, for example which subpages you visit or how you interact with our website. We analyze your activity on our website and use this analysis for personalized advertising.
If you then log in to Facebook or are already logged in to Facebook when visiting our website, Facebook records the visit to our website in your Facebook profile. However, the data is hashed (converted into numerical strings) upon collection. This means we cannot draw any conclusions about your identity. We note, however, that Facebook stores and processes this data; Facebook may use this information for its own market research and advertising purposes, over which we have no influence.
Facebook relies on the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to ensure appropriate data protection. For more details, please see:
    https://www.facebook.com/policy.php
    Further information about the Facebook Pixel and how it works can be found in Facebook’s Help Center:
    https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616
To set which types of ads you see on Facebook, visit:
    https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads
    These settings apply across devices. General information from Facebook about cookies can be found here:
    https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/
You can prevent collection by the Facebook Pixel and the use of your data for displaying Facebook Ads, and withdraw your consent at any time.
    When you disable the Facebook Pixel, an “opt-out” cookie is stored on your device. If you delete cookies in this browser, you have to click the link again. The opt-out only works in the browser you are currently using and only for our website. To opt out of interest-based advertising in general, you can also visit:

You can grant your consent upon accessing our website by clicking the respective button in the “cookie banner.” During the processes described below, data is also regularly transmitted to Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Below, both Google Ireland Limited and Google LLC are referred to as “Google.”
Google Analytics uses cookies (first-party cookies) that enable an analysis of how you use this website. However, this does not mean we become directly aware of your identity. Google uses the information generated by these cookies on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activity, and provide other services related to website and internet usage. This helps us improve the quality of our website and its content, as we gain statistical insights into how the site is used and can optimize our offerings.
The information generated by Google Analytics cookies about your use of this website (e.g., time, location, and frequency of your website visits, including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the USA.
    (Previously, Google referred to the Privacy Shield. )
    Google now relies on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. We have set the retention period for user- and event-level data at 14 months (the shortest available option).
16.5.1 IP Anonymization
We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Consequently, your IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before being transmitted to the USA, and thus anonymized. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. According to Google, the IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.
16.5.2 Browser Plugin
You can prevent Google Analytics cookies from being stored by adjusting your browser software settings accordingly. You can also prevent Google from collecting and processing the data generated by the cookie relating to your usage of the website (including your IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link:
    https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
16.5.3 Objection to Data Collection
Alternatively, you can enable or disable data collection by Google Analytics—especially on mobile devices—by clicking the following link:
    Google Analytics deactivate
    When disabled, a cookie is set that prevents your data from being collected during future visits to this website. Specifically, the following tracking cookies are used by Google Analytics: __utmz, __utma, __utmb, __utmc, __utmt.

    More information about how Google Analytics handles user data, as well as Google’s security and data protection principles and settings or objection options, can be found in Google’s Privacy Policy, available via:

16.6 YouTube
Our website uses plugins of the site YouTube operated by Google. The operator is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
    When you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which of our pages you have visited.
    If you are logged into your YouTube account, YouTube can directly associate your browsing behavior with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
    We use YouTube in the interest of providing an appealing presentation of our online offerings. This constitutes a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

16.7 Cloudflare
We use Cloudflare, Inc. (101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) on this website to make our site faster and more secure. Cloudflare uses cookies and processes user data. Cloudflare provides a content delivery network (CDN) and various security services, acting as a reverse proxy between the user and our hosting provider.
What is Cloudflare? A CDN is a network of globally distributed servers. Cloudflare stores copies of our website on its servers to deliver our content faster to your device. This significantly reduces the data transmission distance to your browser. Especially for users outside of our server’s region, Cloudflare can serve our website from a server near them. Additionally, Cloudflare offers various security services like DDoS protection or a web application firewall.
Why do we use Cloudflare on our website? We aim to provide you with the best possible service. Cloudflare helps make our website faster and more secure, offering load balancing, caching, and security features. It blocks threats, limits abusive bots and crawlers, and generally optimizes performance.
Which data does Cloudflare store? Cloudflare generally forwards only the data that is controlled by website operators. Additionally, Cloudflare may collect certain usage information (e.g., IP addresses, security fingerprints, DNS log data, performance data) derived from user browser activity. This data helps Cloudflare identify threats and improve security. Cloudflare processes data under applicable laws, including the GDPR.
Cloudflare uses the __cfduid cookie for security, identifying individual users behind a shared IP address and applying security settings on a per-user basis. The cookie does not store personal data and is essential for Cloudflare’s security features; it cannot be disabled.
Cloudflare now relies on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy to ensure adequate data protection measures. More details can be found here: https://www.cloudflare.com/de-de/privacypolicy/
How can I delete my data or prevent data storage? Cloudflare typically stores log data for less than 24 hours (or up to 7 days for Enterprise customers using detailed logs). Cloudflare does not store personal data like IP addresses long-term, except in anonymized form for performance and security analysis. If you want to prevent Cloudflare from collecting or processing your data entirely, you can disable the execution of script code in your browser or install a script blocker.

17.2 TeamSpeak USA provides you with information about data security within the company at any time. Please direct your request to privacy@teamspeak.com or the information provided in the imprint of TeamSpeak USA websites.
18. International data transfers
18.1 TeamSpeak USA may transfer personal data to third countries (in particular the USA). If and to the extent TeamSpeak transfers personal data outside the European Union, such transfers take place on the basis of appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR or, if applicable the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework. If there is a conflict between these data transfer mechanisms and the data transfer principles below, the stricter provisions of GDPR will always prevail.
18.2 Types of personal data, purpose of collection and competent authority. TeamSpeak USA collects and uses information in various ways. TeamSpeak USA only collects the data transmitted by your browser for purely informational use of the website. For more detailed information, please refer to section 6 of this Privacy Policy.

Only employees who need access to your personal information in order to perform certain tasks will have access to your personal information. Finally, for the technical security of some of our computer hardware, we rely on the services of third parties. We believe that their security measures are appropriate. For example, when you visit teamspeak.com, you access a server behind closed doors and an electronic firewall. Although we take industry-standard precautions to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. 100% complete security is currently available neither online nor offline. TeamSpeak USA takes current technical measures to ensure data security and in particular to protect your personal data from the dangers of data transmission and the knowledge gained by third parties. TeamSpeak USA also regularly adapts these measures to the state of the art. TeamSpeak USA keeps you informed about data security in your organization at all times.

Please do not send your credit card number or other sensitive information by e-mail.
18.6 Offline Collection, Use and Disclosure of Information

For example, when you call, we only ask for the personal information we need to process the order or answer the question. When we need to store information, we enter it into our database using SSL encryption. Faxes are another example. If you fax us something, we respond to the fax and either store it in a locked room or we destroy the fax if the information does not need to be kept. It should be noted that we try to comply with the standards for data obtained online for data obtained offline.
