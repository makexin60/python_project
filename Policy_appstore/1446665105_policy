OfficeSpace Client Privacy Policy
This Client Privacy Policy applies to clients of OfficeSpace Software Inc. (“OfficeSpace”) that have signed an agreement (“OfficeSpace Clients”) to use our Subscription Services (the “Services”). It
outlines how OfficeSpace collects, uses, processes and protects personal data provided by OfficeSpace Clients who use our Services.
Information we collect and how we use it
OfficeSpace collects only the information we need to provide our Services. The information we collect includes names, email addresses and other contact information so that we can provision your account and provide the Services. OfficeSpace Clients upload their information to our service (“Client Data”) for purposes of receiving the Services. OfficeSpace Clients control their own instances of their Subscription Service and choose what Client Data to submit to OfficeSpace while using the Services. Client Data might include information about your employees (e.g., names, email addresses, titles).
OfficeSpace uses Client Data to provide the Services in accordance with OfficeSpace Clients’ instructions pursuant to their signed agreements with OfficeSpace.
OfficeSpace also receives personal data when OfficeSpace Clients communicate with us directly, for example by email or when a support request is made (“Other Data”). OfficeSpace uses Other Data in furtherance of our legitimate interests in providing our clients with our Services, including responding to support requests and sending other types of communications, and for billing, account management and administrative matters.
OfficeSpace also collects information that web browsers, mobile devices and servers make available, such as internet protocol addresses, browser types, language preferences, time zones, referring URLs, dates and times of access, operating systems, mobile device manufacturers and mobile network information. We include these in our log files to understand more about visitors to our websites and to optimize the experiences of our clients and website visitors.
Data processing commitments and our DPA
OfficeSpace undertakes certain obligations with regard to the protection of the data of OfficeSpace Clients. These include:
Processing Client Data only for the purpose of providing the Services contracted under your Subscription Services Agreement.
Ensuring that anyone who has access to Client Data is contractually or statutorily committed to maintaining its confidentiality.
Implementing appropriate technical, organizational and security measures designed to ensure the protection of Client Data.
Promptly notifying you in case of any event which might compromise the security of your Client Data.
Promptly complying with your requests to correct, transfer or remove Client Data in order to comply with your responsibilities under the applicable data protection law.
Removing all of our Client Data from OfficeSpace systems once your Services are completed.
This statement is only provided to illustrate OfficeSpace’s commitment to our Client and does not constitute a binding agreement. If you wish to enter into our Data Processing Addendum, which will then be incorporated into your contract with OfficeSpace Software, please email us at
[email protected]
.
Data retention
OfficeSpace retains Client Data as long as retention is required to provide the Services and otherwise in accordance with applicable law. OfficeSpace will delete Client Data when the Services are terminated in accordance with OfficeSpace’s standard data deletion practices.
OfficeSpace retains Other Data collected for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or for the amount of time needed for OfficeSpace to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
Communication
OfficeSpace may occasionally send notification emails to OfficeSpace Clients containing updates to our product, legal documents, client support offers or marketing emails. Except for cases where we are required to do so by law, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from receiving those messages.
We will never sell, exchange or distribute our clients’ information and we never use it to send Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail or SPAM email.
Legal bases for processing (for individuals in the European Economic Area)
If you are an individual in the EEA, we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”. OfficeSpace will only process your information if:
We need to do so in order to provide you with our Subscription Services;
If it satisfies a legitimate interest, like for research, development or marketing, and that interest is not overridden by your data protection interests;
If you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; and
If we need to in order to comply with a legal obligation.
If you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, you can change your mind at any time.
Information sharing and disclosure
OfficeSpace does not sell any personal information. We share your information only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy, and only with parties who adopt appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We share information as follows:
Client Instructions
: OfficeSpace will only share and disclose Client Data in accordance with OfficeSpace Clients’ instructions, including any applicable terms in OfficeSpace Clients’ Subscription Services Agreement, and in compliance with applicable law.
Consent
: OfficeSpace may share Other Data with third parties if we have the consent of the data subject to do so.
Legal compliance
: If OfficeSpace receives a request for information from a legal authority or regulatory agency, we may disclose Other Data if we reasonably believe the disclosure is in accordance with our legal obligations.
Changes and contact information
We may periodically update this Privacy Policy so please check back occasionally to review any changes. We will notify Clients regarding any significant updates to our Privacy Policy at the email address you provided to us to receive such updates. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please send us an email at
[email protected]
. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any changes to this Privacy Policy is deemed agreement to the changes.
Our Subprocessors
OfficeSpace Software uses certain subprocessors to assist it in providing Services to you under your Subscription Services Agreement. A subprocessor is a third-party data processor that may have access to Client Data in the course of performing its functions for OfficeSpace, as detailed further below. OfficeSpace evaluates the security, privacy and confidentiality practices of all subprocessors that may have access to Client Data using a commercially reasonable selection process, and requires all subprocessors to commit to contractual obligations equivalent to those that OfficeSpace itself is required to uphold.
How we protect and transfer your information
OfficeSpace requests from all clients an email address to use for privacy-related notifications.
Clients from all over the world subscribe to OfficeSpace’s services, and we collect and store their information in the United States by default, but clients may elect to have their data stored in several geographical regions including the EU, Canada, or Australia. We share your information with our affiliates in order to better serve you. If we transfer information originating in the European Union to another country, we do so in accordance with applicable EU data protection laws. That means that that your information will only be sent to another country if the EU has deemed that country to have an adequate level of data protection, or if the recipient is bound by their own legal commitment to data protection. That legal commitment may include signing the EU Model Contract Clauses, binding corporate rules, or other appropriate legal means to safeguard information transfers.
Controlling your information
If OfficeSpace holds your personal data, you have the right:
To review the information you gave us;
To request that we correct any errors or omissions in your information;
To request that we do not contact you using your information’
To request that we omit your information from any mailing lists we use; and
To request that you be deleted from our records.
If you would like to exercise any of these data subject rights, please contact us at
[email protected]
. To the extent OfficeSpace is acting as a controller of your information, where your personal data has been collected through email communication, requests in your Help Center or other direct means (“Other Data”), we will respond to your request to exercise your rights within a reasonable time frame. To the extent OfficeSpace holds your personal data in its role as a processor of Client Data on behalf of the data controller, an OfficeSpace Client, your request will be forwarded onto the data controller.
Children
OfficeSpace Software’s services are not directed towards children, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under sixteen. If we become aware that a child under sixteen has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete it.
Business transactions
If we sell our business or get acquired or merged, we will ensure that the acquiring entity is legally bound to honor our commitments to you, including the commitments in this Privacy Policy. We will notify you via email or through a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or in the uses of your personal information and service data. We will also notify you about any choices you may have regarding your personal information and service data.
