Information Collection and Use
1.1. Personal Information:
We do not collect any personally identifiable information
                from you when you use the App. Your privacy is our priority, and we respect the confidentiality of your
                personal data.
1.2. Non-Personal Information:
We may automatically collect non-personal information, such
                as device type, operating system, IP address, usage statistics, and technical data. This data helps us
                enhance the App's performance, troubleshoot technical issues, and analyze user behavior.
Translation Services
2.1. Text and Voice Translation:
When you use the App's text and voice translation services,

                translated content.

We may engage trusted third-party service providers to
                assist in operating the App or providing certain services. These providers may access your non-personal
                information, but they are obligated to maintain confidentiality and use the data solely to support
                us.
3.2. Legal Requirements:
We may disclose non-personal information if required by law
                or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations,

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your
                non-personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However,
                please note that no online transmission or electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot
