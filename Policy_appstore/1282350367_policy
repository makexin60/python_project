1. Controller
Toloka is the controller of the personal data processed under this Privacy Notice. This means that Toloka determines the purposes and means of processing these personal data.
You can contact Toloka with any questions regarding the processing of your personal data at
privacy@toloka.ai
.
2. Legal bases
Depending on which features of Toloka you use, Toloka will process your personal data based on one or more of the following legal bases:
Contract
To fulfill our contractual obligations to you and provide access to the Toloka Platform, Toloka may process your personal data. This includes activities such as account registration, or money withdrawal.
Legitimate interest
When Toloka has a legitimate interest in using your personal data in a certain way, provided that such use is necessary and justified given any potential risks to you. We conduct a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected. LIA is a form of risk assessment based on the specific context and circumstances of data processing. Conducting an LIA helps us ensure that processing is lawful and considers the impact it may have on individuals.
Consent
When Toloka requests your explicit consent to process your personal data for specific purposes. Providing consent does not affect your right to use Toloka’s services or to offer services to Toloka.
If processing is based on consent (or explicit consent), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal. For example, to withdraw consent, you can:
contact Toloka by using the contact details specified in section 1 of this Privacy Notice,
click the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of each email in direct marketing email.
If you reside in a jurisdiction where consent is the only or most appropriate legal basis for the processing of personal data as described in this Privacy Notice, your acceptance of this Privacy Notice will be considered as your consent to the processing of your personal data for all purposes outlined herein. You may revoke this consent at any time by contacting us at privacy@toloka.ai.
Legal obligation
Toloka may also be required to share your personal data with competent authorities in accordance with applicable legislation.

4. Transfers to third countries
Toloka transfers personal data to countries that are considered to have insufficient protection of data subjects’ rights under the GDPR ("Third Countries").
For the transfer of your personal data to Third Countries, Toloka employs various tools to:
ensure that the transfer of personal complies with applicable laws;
provide the same level of protection of your personal data as it has in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland or USA;
determine whether the transfer is based on an adequacy decision;
confirm whether the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards (GDPR Article 46 tools) such as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs);
assess whether public authorities in the third country may seek access to the data with or without the knowledge of the data importer, either through legislation, practice, or precedent;
evaluate whether public authorities in the third country may access the data through the telecommunications providers or communication channels, considering applicable legislation, legal powers, technical, financial, and human resources, as well as reported precedents.
Toloka uses a variety of protections tailored to each data transfer to Third Countries, including:
Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (available here
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en
); and
technical protections, such as access control, encryption, malware protection, security event monitoring, management of technical vulnerabilities, network security controls, incident management, and technical compliance reviews.
5. Storage periods and deletion of personal data
Toloka processes your personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill obligations under the Agreement and for Toloka’'s legitimate interests, such as:
maintaining the performance of the Toloka Platform;
making data-driven business decisions regarding new features;
complying with legal obligations;
resolving disputes.
Once the data processing purposes have been achieved, upon termination of the Agreement, or upon your request, Toloka will delete or anonymise your personal data so it no longer identifies you, unless Toloka is required to retain certain data or needs to use it for legally justifiable reasons, such as:
if there is an unresolved issue related to your account, such as an outstanding credit earned for performing tasks or an unresolved claim or dispute;
for Toloka's tax, audit, and accounting obligations;
where necessary and as permitted by applicable law, for our legitimate interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain information security.
6. Your basic personal data rights
Please refer to the table below for your rights and their descriptions.
To exercise your rights, you can contact Toloka using the contact details provided in Section 1 of this Privacy Notice. Toloka may ask you to submit your request in writing and to verify your identity before processing the request.

7. Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal data from children under the age of eighteen (18) years through Toloka Platform. If you are under eighteen (18) years of age, do not attempt to register on Toloka Platform or provide us with any personal data unless you have obtained the requisite parental consent.
If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has violated this Privacy Notice by providing us with personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided in Section 1 of this Privacy Notice.
In accordance with 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d), Toloka notifies you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available to assist you in limiting access to minors. Information about providers of such protections may be found on the Internet by searching “parental control protection” or similar terms.
8. Profiling and automated decision-making
As part of its personal data processing activities, Toloka may perform profiling and automated decision-making to monitor user behavior on the Toloka platform for the purposes of fraud prevention and detection.
Profiling and automated decision-making are conducted through Toloka’s anti-fraud system, which analyzes data collected from user activities on the Toloka platform. This includes features, factors, and statistics derived from user actions. If fraudulent activity is detected, the anti-fraud system may immediately restrict the user's access to task submissions, terminate agreements related to tasks, or, if the fraudulent activity is identified from the task requester's account, restrict their access to Toloka. Factors considered in anti-fraud analysis include, but are not limited to, user task submission logs, user actions in Toloka interface, cookies, CAPTCHA inputs, device details.
You have the right at any time to object to profiling and automated decision-making, and you may request further information about the logic involved and the potential consequences of such profiling and automated decision-making. To exercise this right, you can contact Toloka by sending a request to
privacy@toloka.ai.
Toloka may ask you to specify your request in writing and to verify your identity before processing the request.
At any time, you may request human intervention in the decision-making process, seek an explanation of the decision made, express your own views, and challenge the decision. To do so, please contact Toloka by sending a request to privacy@toloka.ai. Toloka may ask you to specify your request in writing and to verify your identity. If the fraudulent activity detected is not severe and your identity is successfully verified, your access to Toloka platform may be restored. However, if severe fraudulent activity is detected or you are unable to verify your identity, your access to Toloka may remain restricted.
Toloka periodically reviews the algorithms and processes personal data based on anomaly detection in anti-fraud metrics to ensure that the decision-making process is functioning as intended and that the method of processing remains fair, efficient, and equitable.
9. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of the European Union where you reside.
10. Principles of data security
We have implemented Information Security Management System (ISMS) compliant with international standard “ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information technology — Security techniques — Information security management systems — Requirements” and Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) compliant with the requirements of the international standard «ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Security techniques — Extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management — Requirements and guidelines». Toloka annually passes an audit performed by the independent external auditor to support continuous improvement of approaches and measures used to keep Your data secured.
Technical and organizational measures
We employ various technical and organizational safeguards to protect personal data against loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include:
encrypting personal data in transit and at rest;
conducting regular vulnerability scans;
implementing organizational and legal measures, such as granting employees restricted access to personal data, holding annual awareness events, and holding them accountable for any unauthorized disclosure or misuse;
committing to privacy user journeys;

Your California Privacy Rights
We have implemented policies and procedures to help facilitate the exercise of privacy rights available to California residents under applicable law. If you are a California resident, you are entitled to the rights described in Section 6 of this Privacy Notice. In addition, you may be entitled to the following:
Disclosure of Direct Marketers:

As defined under relevant law, you have a right to non-discrimination in the services or quality of services you receive from us for exercising your rights.
Please contact us with the use of contact details specified in Section 1 of this Privacy Notice if you wish to exercise these rights. Note that we may ask you to verify your identity - such as by requiring you to provide information about yourself - before responding to such requests.
Submitting a Verifiable Request under the CCPA
California residents have certain rights regarding their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"). Toloka will respond to an individual's "verifiable request" to exercise their rights under the CCPA - that is, when Toloka has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and Toloka has been able to verify the individual's identity. The need to verify an individual's identity is crucial to protecting your information and ensuring that it is not shared with someone pretending to be you or not authorized to act on your behalf.
You may submit a verifiable request using the contact details specified in Section 1 of this Privacy Notice. To process your request, we will ask you to provide information to help us verify your identity. This information may include your name, address, whether you have an account with Toloka, and any other information deemed necessary to reasonably verify your identity.
Once we have your submission, we will compare the information you provide to the information we have on file to verify your identity. If necessary, we may request additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity.
We will not share your information or fulfill any requests if we are unable to confirm that a request is a "verifiable request". If we cannot verify your identity, we will not be able to process your request.
Submitting a request through an authorized agent.
Under California law, a California resident can appoint an “authorized agent” to submit certain verifiable requests on their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect or to request the deletion of the consumer's information. An authorized agent may submit a request by following the steps outlined above.
An authorized agent may submit a request by following the steps outlined above. However, the agent must identify the consumer they are acting on behalf of and provide the information necessary for us to verify the consumer’s identity. Additionally, we will require the authorized agent to submit proof of their authorization to act on the consumer’s behalf.
To ensure the security and privacy of your information, we will request that you provide written consent for the person acting as your authorized agent. This consent may include us contacting you directly to confirm that the individual claiming to be your agent has your permission to access or delete your information. We will also verify your identity independently to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to exercise your rights without permission.
We will not share your information or honor any requests in situations where you have not provided written authorization for an agent to act on your behalf, or where we are unable to verify your identity.
Submitting a Request for Removal of Minor Information.
To request the removal of information about a minor from T, parents or guardians may submit a request with the subject line “Removal of Minor Information.” This request must come from the minor’s parent or guardian; minors themselves may not submit information to us via email.
Your submission should include the following details:
• the nature of your request
• the identity of the content or information to be removed
• whether the content or information is found on the Toloka Platform
• the location of the content or information on the Toloka Platform (e.g., providing the URL of the specific web page where the content or information is found)
• a statement that the request is related to the “Removal of Minor Information”
• your name, street address, city, state, ZIP code, and email address
If we become aware that a minor has provided personal data or otherwise used the Toloka Platform in violation of the Privacy Notice, we will take steps to remove that information.
Our Policy on "Do Not Track" Signals under the California Online Protection Act
We do not support Do Not Track (DNT). DNT is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not wish to be tracked. You can enable or disable DNT by visiting the “Preferences” or “Settings” section of your web browser.
Please note that third parties may collect data about you. We cannot control how third parties respond to Do Not Track signals or other similar mechanisms. The collection and use of data by third parties, and their responsiveness to Do Not Track signals, is governed by their respective privacy policies.
B. Privacy Information for Residents of Colorado, Utah, Virginia, and Nevada:
Unless otherwise stated by the law of your state of residence, the provisions in Chapter A “Privacy Information for California Residents” will apply to the processing of your data. If you have questions related to your rights or any other aspects of this Privacy Notice, please contact us using the methods outlined in Section 1.
15. Changes to this Privacy Notice
Toloka may update this Privacy Notice from time to time, at its discretion, but not less than once every 12 months. When changes are made, Toloka will take reasonable steps to notify you about these changes and their effects, using appropriate methods and providing timely notice.

Assembly Bill No. 1564 (2019–20)
SECTION 1.
This measure shall be known and may be cited as “The
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.”
SEC. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
(a)
In 1972, California voters amended the California
Constitution to include the right of privacy among the “inalienable” rights of
all people. The amendment established a legal and enforceable right of privacy
for every Californian. Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of
individuals to control the use, including the sale, of their personal
information.
(b)
Since California voters approved the right of privacy,
the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to safeguard
Californians’ privacy, including the Online Privacy Protection Act, the Privacy
Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, and Shine the Light, a
California law intended to give Californians the ‘who, what, where, and when’
of how businesses handle consumers’ personal information.
(c)
At the same time, California is one of the world’s
leaders in the development of new technologies and related industries. Yet the
proliferation of personal information has limited Californians’ ability to
properly protect and safeguard their privacy. It is almost impossible to apply
for a job, raise a child, drive a car, or make an appointment without sharing
personal information.
(d)
As the role of technology and data in
the
every
daily lives of consumers increases, there is an increase in the
amount of personal information shared by consumers with businesses. California
law has not kept pace with these developments and the personal privacy
implications surrounding the collection, use, and protection of personal
information.
(e)
Many businesses collect personal information from
California consumers. They may know where a consumer lives and how many
children a consumer has, how fast a consumer drives, a consumer’s personality,
sleep habits, biometric and health information, financial information, precise
geolocation information, and social networks, to name a few categories.
(f)
The unauthorized disclosure of personal information and
the loss of privacy can have devastating effects for individuals, ranging from
financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs to personal time and
finances, to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage,
emotional stress, and even potential physical harm.
(g)
In March 2018, it came to light that tens of millions of
people had their personal data misused by a data mining firm called Cambridge
Analytica. A series of congressional hearings highlighted that our personal
information may be vulnerable to misuse when shared on the Internet. As a
result, our desire for privacy controls and transparency in data practices is
heightened.
(h)
People desire privacy and more control over their
information. California consumers should be able to exercise control over their
personal information, and they want to be certain that there are safeguards
against misuse of their personal information. It is possible for businesses
both to respect consumers’ privacy and provide a
high level
transparency to their business practices.
(
i
) Therefore, it is the intent of
the Legislature to further Californians’ right to privacy by giving consumers
an effective way to control their personal information, by ensuring the
following rights:
(1)
The right of Californians to know what personal information
is being collected about them.
(2)
The right of Californians to know whether their personal
information is sold or disclosed and to whom.
(3)
The right of Californians to say no to the sale of personal
information.
(4)
The right of Californians to access their personal
information.
(5)
The right of Californians to equal service and price, even if
they exercise their privacy rights.
SEC. 3. Title 1.81.5 (commencing with Section 1798.100)
is added to Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, to read:
1798.100
(a)
A
consumer
shall have the right to request that a
business
that
collects
a
consumer
’s
personal information
disclose to that
consumer
the categories and specific pieces of
personal information
the
business
has
collected
.
(b)
A
business
that
collects
a
consumer
’s
personal information
shall, at or before the point of
collection
, inform
consumer
s as to the categories of
personal information
to be
collected
and the purposes for which the categories of
personal information
shall be used. A
business
shall not
collect
additional categories of
personal information
or use
personal information
collected
for additional purposes without providing the
consumer
with notice consistent with this section.
(c)
A
business
shall provide the information specified in subdivision (a) to a
consumer
only upon receipt of a
verifiable
consumer
request.
(d)
A
business
that receives a
verifiable
consumer
request from a
consumer
to access
personal information
shall promptly take steps to disclose and deliver, free of charge to the
consumer

consumer
from declining to request information from a
business
, declining to opt-out of a
business
’s
sale
of the
consumer
’s
personal information
, or authorizing a
business
to
sell
the
consumer
’s
personal information
after previously opting out.
1798.194
This title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.
1798.196

Serbian Law on Protection of Personal Data 2018
US privacy legislation (including but not limited to
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

1. Controller
Toloka is the controller of the personal data processed under this Privacy Notice. This means that Toloka determines the purposes and means of processing these personal data.
You can contact Toloka with any questions regarding the processing of your personal data at
privacy@toloka.ai
.
2. Legal bases
Depending on which features of Toloka you use, Toloka will process your personal data based on one or more of the following legal bases:
Contract
To fulfill our contractual obligations to you and provide access to the Toloka Platform, Toloka may process your personal data. This includes activities such as account registration, or money withdrawal.
Legitimate interest
When Toloka has a legitimate interest in using your personal data in a certain way, provided that such use is necessary and justified given any potential risks to you. We conduct a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected. LIA is a form of risk assessment based on the specific context and circumstances of data processing. Conducting an LIA helps us ensure that processing is lawful and considers the impact it may have on individuals.
Consent
When Toloka requests your explicit consent to process your personal data for specific purposes. Providing consent does not affect your right to use Toloka’s services or to offer services to Toloka.
If processing is based on consent (or explicit consent), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal. For example, to withdraw consent, you can:
contact Toloka by using the contact details specified in section 1 of this Privacy Notice,
click the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of each email in direct marketing email.
If you reside in a jurisdiction where consent is the only or most appropriate legal basis for the processing of personal data as described in this Privacy Notice, your acceptance of this Privacy Notice will be considered as your consent to the processing of your personal data for all purposes outlined herein. You may revoke this consent at any time by contacting us at privacy@toloka.ai.
Legal obligation
Toloka may also be required to share your personal data with competent authorities in accordance with applicable legislation.
3. Categories of personal data processed by Toloka
The table below outlines the categories of personal data Toloka collects and processes. Toloka primarily collects personal data directly from data subjects (e.g., by completing the registration form). Additionally, certain personal data may also be obtained from third parties.

4. Transfers to third countries
Toloka transfers personal data to countries that are considered to have insufficient protection of data subjects’ rights under the GDPR ("Third Countries").
For the transfer of your personal data to Third Countries, Toloka employs various tools to:
ensure that the transfer of personal complies with applicable laws;
provide the same level of protection of your personal data as it has in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland or USA;
determine whether the transfer is based on an adequacy decision;
confirm whether the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards (GDPR Article 46 tools) such as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs);
assess whether public authorities in the third country may seek access to the data with or without the knowledge of the data importer, either through legislation, practice, or precedent;
evaluate whether public authorities in the third country may access the data through the telecommunications providers or communication channels, considering applicable legislation, legal powers, technical, financial, and human resources, as well as reported precedents.
Toloka uses a variety of protections tailored to each data transfer to Third Countries, including:
Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (available here
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en
); and
technical protections, such as access control, encryption, malware protection, security event monitoring, management of technical vulnerabilities, network security controls, incident management, and technical compliance reviews.
5. Storage periods and deletion of personal data
Toloka processes your personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill obligations under the Agreement and for Toloka’'s legitimate interests, such as:
maintaining the performance of the Toloka Platform;
making data-driven business decisions regarding new features;
complying with legal obligations;
resolving disputes.
Once the data processing purposes have been achieved, upon termination of the Agreement, or upon your request, Toloka will delete or anonymise your personal data so it no longer identifies you, unless Toloka is required to retain certain data or needs to use it for legally justifiable reasons, such as:
if there is an unresolved issue related to your account, such as an outstanding credit earned for performing tasks or an unresolved claim or dispute;
for Toloka's tax, audit, and accounting obligations;
where necessary and as permitted by applicable law, for our legitimate interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain information security.

If you are under eighteen (18) years of age, do not attempt to register on Toloka Platform or provide us with any personal data unless you have obtained the requisite parental consent.
If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has violated this Privacy Notice by providing us with personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided in Section 1 of this Privacy Notice.
In accordance with 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d), Toloka notifies you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available to assist you in limiting access to minors. Information about providers of such protections may be found on the Internet by searching “parental control protection” or similar terms.
8. Profiling and automated decision-making
As part of its personal data processing activities, Toloka may perform profiling and automated decision-making to monitor user behavior on the Toloka platform for the purposes of fraud prevention and detection.
Profiling and automated decision-making are conducted through Toloka’s anti-fraud system, which analyzes data collected from user activities on the Toloka platform. This includes features, factors, and statistics derived from user actions. If fraudulent activity is detected, the anti-fraud system may immediately restrict the user's access to task submissions, terminate agreements related to tasks, or, if the fraudulent activity is identified from the task requester's account, restrict their access to Toloka. Factors considered in anti-fraud analysis include, but are not limited to, user task submission logs, user actions in Toloka interface, cookies, CAPTCHA inputs, device details.
You have the right at any time to object to profiling and automated decision-making, and you may request further information about the logic involved and the potential consequences of such profiling and automated decision-making. To exercise this right, you can contact Toloka by sending a request to
privacy@toloka.ai.
Toloka may ask you to specify your request in writing and to verify your identity before processing the request.
At any time, you may request human intervention in the decision-making process, seek an explanation of the decision made, express your own views, and challenge the decision. To do so, please contact Toloka by sending a request to privacy@toloka.ai. Toloka may ask you to specify your request in writing and to verify your identity. If the fraudulent activity detected is not severe and your identity is successfully verified, your access to Toloka platform may be restored. However, if severe fraudulent activity is detected or you are unable to verify your identity, your access to Toloka may remain restricted.
Toloka periodically reviews the algorithms and processes personal data based on anomaly detection in anti-fraud metrics to ensure that the decision-making process is functioning as intended and that the method of processing remains fair, efficient, and equitable.
9. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of the European Union where you reside.
10. Principles of data security
We have implemented Information Security Management System (ISMS) compliant with international standard “ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information technology — Security techniques — Information security management systems — Requirements” and Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) compliant with the requirements of the international standard «ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Security techniques — Extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management — Requirements and guidelines». Toloka annually passes an audit performed by the independent external auditor to support continuous improvement of approaches and measures used to keep Your data secured.
Technical and organizational measures
We employ various technical and organizational safeguards to protect personal data against loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include:
encrypting personal data in transit and at rest;
conducting regular vulnerability scans;
implementing organizational and legal measures, such as granting employees restricted access to personal data, holding annual awareness events, and holding them accountable for any unauthorized disclosure or misuse;
committing to privacy user journeys;
conducting data protection impact assessments to ensure compliance with privacy principles.

Your California Privacy Rights
We have implemented policies and procedures to help facilitate the exercise of privacy rights available to California residents under applicable law. If you are a California resident, you are entitled to the rights described in Section 6 of this Privacy Notice. In addition, you may be entitled to the following:
Disclosure of Direct Marketers:
You may request, at no charge, the categories and names/addresses of third parties that have received your personal information for direct marketing purposes. Toloka does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
Right to Information About Collecting, Selling, Sharing, or Disclosing Personal Information:

the categories of third parties with whom personal information is shared, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information:
California residents have the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information under certain circumstances.
Right to Non-Discrimination
As defined under relevant law, you have a right to non-discrimination in the services or quality of services you receive from us for exercising your rights.
Please contact us with the use of contact details specified in Section 1 of this Privacy Notice if you wish to exercise these rights. Note that we may ask you to verify your identity - such as by requiring you to provide information about yourself - before responding to such requests.
Submitting a Verifiable Request under the CCPA
California residents have certain rights regarding their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"). Toloka will respond to an individual's "verifiable request" to exercise their rights under the CCPA - that is, when Toloka has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and Toloka has been able to verify the individual's identity. The need to verify an individual's identity is crucial to protecting your information and ensuring that it is not shared with someone pretending to be you or not authorized to act on your behalf.
You may submit a verifiable request using the contact details specified in Section 1 of this Privacy Notice. To process your request, we will ask you to provide information to help us verify your identity. This information may include your name, address, whether you have an account with Toloka, and any other information deemed necessary to reasonably verify your identity.
Once we have your submission, we will compare the information you provide to the information we have on file to verify your identity. If necessary, we may request additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity.
We will not share your information or fulfill any requests if we are unable to confirm that a request is a "verifiable request". If we cannot verify your identity, we will not be able to process your request.
Submitting a request through an authorized agent.
Under California law, a California resident can appoint an “authorized agent” to submit certain verifiable requests on their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect or to request the deletion of the consumer's information. An authorized agent may submit a request by following the steps outlined above.
An authorized agent may submit a request by following the steps outlined above. However, the agent must identify the consumer they are acting on behalf of and provide the information necessary for us to verify the consumer’s identity. Additionally, we will require the authorized agent to submit proof of their authorization to act on the consumer’s behalf.
To ensure the security and privacy of your information, we will request that you provide written consent for the person acting as your authorized agent. This consent may include us contacting you directly to confirm that the individual claiming to be your agent has your permission to access or delete your information. We will also verify your identity independently to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to exercise your rights without permission.
We will not share your information or honor any requests in situations where you have not provided written authorization for an agent to act on your behalf, or where we are unable to verify your identity.
Submitting a Request for Removal of Minor Information.
To request the removal of information about a minor from T, parents or guardians may submit a request with the subject line “Removal of Minor Information.” This request must come from the minor’s parent or guardian; minors themselves may not submit information to us via email.
Your submission should include the following details:
• the nature of your request
• the identity of the content or information to be removed
• whether the content or information is found on the Toloka Platform
• the location of the content or information on the Toloka Platform (e.g., providing the URL of the specific web page where the content or information is found)
• a statement that the request is related to the “Removal of Minor Information”
• your name, street address, city, state, ZIP code, and email address
If we become aware that a minor has provided personal data or otherwise used the Toloka Platform in violation of the Privacy Notice, we will take steps to remove that information.
Our Policy on "Do Not Track" Signals under the California Online Protection Act
We do not support Do Not Track (DNT). DNT is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not wish to be tracked. You can enable or disable DNT by visiting the “Preferences” or “Settings” section of your web browser.
Please note that third parties may collect data about you. We cannot control how third parties respond to Do Not Track signals or other similar mechanisms. The collection and use of data by third parties, and their responsiveness to Do Not Track signals, is governed by their respective privacy policies.
B. Privacy Information for Residents of Colorado, Utah, Virginia, and Nevada:
Unless otherwise stated by the law of your state of residence, the provisions in Chapter A “Privacy Information for California Residents” will apply to the processing of your data. If you have questions related to your rights or any other aspects of this Privacy Notice, please contact us using the methods outlined in Section 1.
15. Changes to this Privacy Notice
Toloka may update this Privacy Notice from time to time, at its discretion, but not less than once every 12 months. When changes are made, Toloka will take reasonable steps to notify you about these changes and their effects, using appropriate methods and providing timely notice.
