4. Purposes and basis for processing
The purpose of handling the Customer personal data is to manage and maintain a working relationship between the Customer and the Company.
In addition, the use of existing Customers' personal data is aimed at direct marketing of services and products of the Company.

6 Regular sources of information

8. Transfers of personal data outside the EU or EEA
The Company may also use other service providers for the processing of personal data outside the European Union or the European Economic Area.

The European Commission has established that an adequate level of data protection will be ensured in the recipient country concerned;

Personal data may be stored longer if the applicable law (e.g. the Accounting Act) or the contractual obligations of the Company to a third party require longer retention periods.
10. Registered Rights
The Customer has the right, at any time, to object to the processing of his/her personal data for direct marketing purposes. The Customer may give the Company specific consents and bans with regards to direct marketing (for example, he/she may prohibit marketing e-mails, but allow marketing messages sent by a letter).
In addition, the Customer is entitled, at any time, to demand compliance with applicable data protection laws, namely:
to receive information regarding the processing of his/her personal data;
to obtain access to their personal information and verify how this personal data is processed by the Company;
to demand rectification and/or supplementation of erroneous and/or insufficient personal data;
to demand the removal of their personal data;
to object to the processing of his/her personal data on a basis related to their personal situation, even if the processing of personal data is the legitimate interest of the Company;
to obtain personal data in a convertible format and transfer such information to another Registrar, provided that this particular Customer has personally supplied his/her personal information to the Company, and the Company processed such personal data on the basis of the contractual agreement and the processing was performed automatically; and
to demand a restriction in the processing of their personal data.
The Customer must submit a request for the implementation of the aforementioned rights, using contact details shown in this document. The Company may ask the Customer to specify the details of his/her request in writing and to confirm the Customer's identity, before processing this request. The Company may refuse to execute the request on the basis of the applicable law
11. The right to appeal to the supervisory authority
The Customer has the right to file a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority or with the supervisory authority of the EU Member State where the Customer's place of residence or work is 3 (3) located, if the Registrant considers that the Company has not processed the personal data in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.
12. Security
Any digitally processed personal data is protected and stored in the Company's information system, access to which is limited only to persons who need this information for performing their legitimate duties. These individuals have access to their respective personal usernames and passwords.
