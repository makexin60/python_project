Effective date: February 20, 2020
TL;DR:
No personal information is gathered from the application unless you are using the Cloud Sync feature within Pro Mode. We use Firebase Analytics and Apple App Store Data to collect anonymous aggregate data. Firebase Analytics gathers information such as country, amount of time spent on a page across all users, and how often users return to the application. Apple reports information such as OS version, country, carrier, and date downloaded.
If you are using the Cloud Sync feature within Pro Mode, you will be required to sign in with a Google Account. Your entries will be securely uploaded to Google Cloud Storage via Firebase Storage. Remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you are from the European Union, please view the section below called “European Union Information” for information on how we comply with privacy laws in the EU.

If you are from the European Union, there is an additional section called ‘European Union Information’ for information on how we comply with privacy laws in the EU.
*****************
This page is used to inform app users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
Service Providers
I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
To facilitate our Service;
To provide the Service on our behalf;
To perform Service-related services; or
To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
Security
I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Links to Other Sites
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
