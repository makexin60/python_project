Privacy Policy
This is the AppyWay Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy” or “Policy”). This Privacy Policy details how we collect, store, protect and share your information, and with whom we share it. Please ensure you read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions for AppyParking+, and Terms and Conditions for AppyParking.
This Privacy Policy governs the AppyParking and AppyParking+ mobile parking applications for iOS & Android (collectively the “Apps”), the AppyParking, AppyParking+ and AppyWay websites, any AppyWay owned microsites, and our digital products and services (such as any competitions or surveys that we may issue from time to time), (together referred to in this Privacy Policy as our “Sites”).
Whilst you are using the Apps and / or Sites, we will collect some information about you, and we may also need to share your information sometimes.
The App and Sites can be accessed globally, and your information will be sent to and used in the EEA, USA and the UK regardless of the country you reside in. This Privacy Policy also explains how we protect your personal data when we transfer it overseas.
The Apps and Sites are operated by Yellow Line Parking Limited trading as AppyWay (“AppyWay”, “we” or “us”). AppyWay is the controller of personal information collected and processed through the Apps and Sites. AppyWay has a designated Data Protection Officer, who can be reached by emailing support@appyway.com or by post at the following address: FAO: AppyWay Data Protection Officer, Cannon Place, 78 Cannon Street, EC4N 6AF, London.

Payment information
Where the service is available, you can use the Apps and / or Sites to make payment for parking. If you choose to use this service, we will process your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit / tax purposes. In order to process your cashless payment for a parking space, the Apps use a secure third-party payment platform. The payment platform will tokenize your card details and then use them to make payment to a car park provider or council depending on the type of parking you have selected. Cashless payment parking is fully PCI compliant.
Subscriptions to AppyParking+ Premium are managed by Google on Android and Apple on iOS.

Service Providers
We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us (“Service Providers”). The suppliers with which we share your personal data varies depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our App, Sites and services you engage with. For example, to provide our services to you, we typically use the following suppliers:
Payment services – to allow customers to purchase paid features of our Apps and Site Product improvement and market research – we use third party platforms to carry out analytics, customer surveys and market research to improve our products and services
IT services – some of the third-party software providers used in the operation of our business may process your personal data
We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing. Measures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible and our suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention limits.
Marketing Services Providers
We partner with providers of marketing services (“Marketing Services Providers”) to help us market and advertise our Apps, Sites and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. For example: Active Campaign, Apple Search Ads, AppsFlyer, Braze, Calendly Google, Leadfeeder, LinkedIn, Met, Microsoft, Salesforce, Twitter, Yahoo, Zapier
We share a limited amount of your personal data with these Marketing Services Providers, such as:
the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer (for example but not limited to Apple, Samsung, OnePlus, Google…) to your device to help advertisers (including the manufacturer) know when an ad has been viewed or clicked in an app, and when an ad causes a ‘conversion’ (for example, downloading the app advertised to you))
your estimated location (based on your IP address)
your device location (precise or approximate) if you granted the app access to that info
age and gender
data about your visit to our Sites or Apps and action taken on those (for example if you downloaded our Apps or created an account with our Apps)
a hashed* version of your email address (to create ‘custom audiences’).
*Hashing is a way of encrypting information by turning it into a combination of random numbers and letters – this code cannot be traced back to the email address. When hashed email addresses are sent to a Marketing Service Provider, they’re then matched against the Marketing Service Provider’s own existing list of their own users’ hashed information and our ads are served to those of our users who have successfully been matched with the Marketing Service Provider’s. Matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted by the Marketing Service Provider.
For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including how you can set and manage your preferences with regards to such technologies, please see our Cookie Policy –
https://appyway.com/cookies-policy/
