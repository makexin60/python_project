Opting out of the Digital advertising service powered by Chalk Digital
Chalk Digital has created a technology that enables advertisers to place advertisements for their product or services on websites and mobile apps where you may visit. Cookies and other non-cookie technologies such as web beacons or tags, statistical identifiers and/or mobile advertising ID (e.g., Apple’s IDFA) are used to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to determine the display of content and advertising to you based on your interests both on third-party sites and mobile apps where you may visit. To support this interest-based advertising solution, we, and companies who we have contracted with, may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our and other Web sites. The information collected does not enable any third-party to identify or contact you individually, without appropriate notice or consent. Although it is our hope that you find the display of advertising to you based on your non-personally identifying browsing interests valuable, if you would prefer not to participate in the services offered through these solutions, you can always opt-out of this activity by visiting
https://geoad.chalkdigital.com/#/mobile/opt/page
Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.
