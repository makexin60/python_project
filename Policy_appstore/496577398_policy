What information we capture and why …
Publication purchases and subscriptions
Subscription data is provided to us directly by you. Information usually includes your name, contact details and details of your subscription, including bank or credit/debit card information and payment history.
These details are held within our subscriptions database which is located in the UK.
We are relying on our contractual obligation to you to process your information. At the end of our relationship we need to keep this information for tax purposes and other legal reasons. We will keep the information secure and delete it four years from the end of our last transaction with you.
In order to fulfil our commitments to you we need to share some of your information with our data processors. This will include our payment processing companies, couriers and mailing houses.
Events (including club invitations)
In order to manage your attendance at our events, and to keep you informed of future events, we maintain a list of company details, clubs and individuals who have both attended and/or expressed an interest in attending future events.
We will keep a record of your name, company or club, including your address, email and telephone contact details as well as the events which you have attended, or would like to attend. We may also ask you if you have any special requirements such as mobility issues or dietary requirements, and we will not
etain this information beyond the event with which that information is relevant
.
We may become aware of, or identify special interest groups and specialist clubs which we feel would benefit from attending the events we offer. We may become aware of this by word of mouth, through publications or newspapers and the internet. As long as this information is in the public domain we shall reach out to that organisation and invite them to participate in our events using the lawful reason of legitimate interests to conduct direct marketing.
If we are holding your details solely to keep you informed about events you can ask us to stop processing at any time; if you have attended an event we will hold your details for up to four years in case of a query and for legal reasons and our own legitimate interests.
We shall retain personal data of customer transactions but for customers with whom we have no ongoing relationship we shall remove their personal details, in other words anonymise the information four years after your last transaction with us.
Competitions
At Mortons we run a range of highly popular competitions and need to keep records of entrants and winners. For those lucky winners we need to capture and store additional details such as details of the prize and how and when it was supplied. We also would retain details of any correspondence, complaints or enquiries from individuals regarding the competitions.
We rely on your consent to capture your name and details when you first enter the competition and we will keep the information on our live system for the duration of that competition. Once we have your information, for various legal and contractual reasons we need to retain it for 12 months. We will use your information to contact you about topics we believe to be of interest to you during this time.
If you are lucky and win a prize we need to share your details with our fulfilment or delivery company and, with your permission, we shall publish your name on our website and in future publications.
Clients, suppliers and prospects
To manage our business relationships and seek out new clients, we need to capture and retain details of organisations and individuals within them, along with the particulars of those relationships. We may hold information on job roles, contact details and notes of interactions and conversations, and for certain types of sales calls we may record the conversation
.
For some clients and partners, we also hold details of financial transactions and keep copies of contractual documentation in both manual and digital formats.
We may record other information necessary to deliver the service, for example, information regarding your colleagues, or relevant background information, but we will only ever record information deemed sensitive, such as details of a disability you may have, if it is required to comply with legislation, it is necessary to deliver the service to you or you give us your explicit permission.
We will obtain information directly from you, either in person, or from a colleague, and via normal business channels such as email, telephone, Skype and social media and at networking or business events. We may also obtain your details from public domain sources or purchase third party data for direct marketing purposes (for more information see the section on marketing
below
).
We will use your personal data to enable us to provide our products and services to you, manage our relationships and maintain a list for direct marketing purposes.
We shall be processing your information, including the recording of sales calls, using the lawful basis of legitimate interests and, and if we are required to hold any special category or sensitive data about you, unless there is a legal reason which compels us to hold or share this, we shall ask for your explicit consent.
If we have a legal agreement in place with you, or are in negotiation with you for goods or services, then we will rely upon contractual obligations to store and retain your information.
Retention timescales
For clients or suppliers with whom we have an ongoing working relationship we shall retain personal data for the life of the relationship. For contacts with whom we have no ongoing relationship we shall
anonymise
the information four years after we have ceased corresponding with them. You can ask us to cease processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time.
Employees and finance
To comply with employment and tax law, we need to keep accurate records of current and past employees of Mortons.
In order to consider job applications, offer employment, and comply with our statutory legal obligations such as the right to work within the UK, we ask for your personal details, including contact details. Details of your marital status and next of kin will be collected and other information such as qualifications and work experience will be requested to ensure you are qualified to fulfil your role. Your date of birth, nationality and other sensitive information such as ethnicity, sexuality, and criminal records, as well as any medical information that we may need to be aware of will also be requested. We need this additional special category data to comply with our legal obligations and our internal anti-discrimination policy, although of course you are free to decline to supply some of this information. Copies of emails sent and received by employees during their day- to- day activities, and details of websites visited, are retained and can be accessed and viewed by managers and our IT department.
To manage our payroll and meet our tax obligations we shall keep a record of your bank and salary details. Occasionally we may ask you to voluntarily provide some information which is not strictly necessary for your employment, for example, your photo to appear on social media or in a publication.
We process your employment, financial and payroll data under our legal and contractual obligations. For those elements which are not wholly necessary for your employment, such as the photograph example above, we shall rely upon your explicit voluntary consent and in other cases our own legitimate interests.
Depending on the nature of the employment information we hold we shall retain it securely for varying periods of time. This will range from just six months for CVs for unsuccessful applicants, to indefinitely for some insurance and medical test result information. However, on average, we keep employment, financial and payroll data while an employee is employed, plus six years after they leave our employment. Certain records, such as disciplinary records, are deleted when they expire and other records, such as payslips, are deleted when they are no longer required for tax purposes.
Sharing your employee data
We treat all employee data in the strictest of confidence, but on occasions it may be necessary to share your information with other parties. This will usually be in connection with your employment, payroll or tax queries, such as, but not limited to, obtaining confidential references, liaising with third party organisations who would verify your employment history, seeking advice from our professional advisors, processing of payroll and also in connection with identity and right to work checks.
Your data will also be shared internally where this is necessary to facilitate your employment, or support you in your role.
Visitors to our website and social media
When you visit our website(s) or interact with us on social media we will capture a range of different information about you. By visiting our website we will be able to see your IP address, system type (PC, iPhone, Windows 10 etc.) and the pages you visit; your information is anonymous until you log in as a user, at which point you will be identified along with the pages visited on our site.
This information is captured via Google Analytics, which is detailed below and in our
Cookie Policy
. At any time you can stop the collection of your anonymous data by opting out of Google Analytics using the link below.
Details of your interactions with us via social media will be maintained by the relevant media company and a history will be available within their records. Details of any significant interaction may also be added to our internal records.
Apart from members of our digital and subscriptions teams, the only other party who may have access to our website visitor traffic will be the website hosting company and our software developer. We shall at all times ensure that they keep your information confidential.

We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our website(s); Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ devices.
For more information on cookies visit
http://www.aboutcookies.org.uk
The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of our website. Details captured during your visit will include, but is not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data and the resources you access, however, all data collected is anonymous and will not identify you as an individual.
Google, not Mortons, store this activity information, and you can find out more by viewing Google’s
privacy policy

Who will have access to your information?
Only those members of staff who need to access your personal data to assist you with an enquiry, or to fulfil their job role, will have access to your personal information. Your data will only be shared with external organisations who need the information to fulfil our obligations to you, for example with the Royal Mail.
We may share data with third parties if we are required to do so by law, such as the police, under a court order etc., or if the sharing is required for the detection or prevention of fraud or a crime.
We may also share your information with other third parties if it is in the defence of a legal claim, such as seeking legal advice from a solicitor or in the case of an enforcement company regarding an overdue account.
We promise we shall never sell or share your information with any other commercial third party.
Where we store your information
As stated above most of your information will be stored within the EEA, however, some cloud providers which we use, such as for our email broadcasting, are hosted in third countries, including the USA, which are deemed by the EU to have adequate safeguards to protect your information.
We have taken all reasonable precautions and due-diligence to ensure that the information we process about you remains safe and secure.
Marketing, consents and permissions
If you are an individual consumer, or club or corporate subscriber, then we may use your personal information to contact you about our products and services where we believe they may be of interest to you. We may deliver marketing communications to you by post or email.
Private individuals and club members
For most of the records we hold we have the consent of the individual consumer to send direct marketing materials to them. Occasionally we may purchase a mailing list from a reputable data house, but would only use those where either the individual has consented to their information being shared, or the information has been collated lawfully from a public domain source, such as the edited electoral register.
Sometimes a contact within a club may ask us to send the information to a different person as they know it will be of interest to them.
Corporate individuals
Most corporate subscribers voluntarily ask to receive information from us, and we try and ask for consent before adding them to our mailing list. However, the data protection legislation allows us to send marketing materials to corporate individuals with whom we have no pre-existing relationship if their information is in the public domain, and that information is relevant to them.
We will therefore always try and obtain opt-in consent before adding a person to our mailing list; and at all times and in all correspondence we will clearly state that we are Mortons Media Group and clearly tell them how they can change or update their marketing preferences or unsubscribe completely.
If you have made contact with us then we shall rely on a combination of your consent, our legitimate interests to record your information, and if we wish to send you administrative or marketing emails, we rely on what is called the soft-opt-in, or pre-existing relationship, to send those emails to you (at any time you can ask us to stop sending these to you).
Right to object
You have an absolute right to ask us to stop processing your information for direct marketing purposes at any time – more of your rights are detailed below.
We will not share or sell your marketing or personal information with any third parties, save with your permission or required by law.
General
For security reasons at our head office in Horncastle. Staff and visitors to the site are recorded and if you would like to know more details please contact Charlotte Park whose details are below.
As a very proactive and forward-thinking organisation we stay up to date with technological advancements and we will continue to embrace new technology such as artificial intelligence, secure home and mobile working and the internet of things.
We shall always ensure that potential privacy risks involved in introducing these new technologies are considered and your safety always put at the forefront of our thoughts, ensuring that adequate technical and organisational security measures are put in place to keep you safe.
Your rights
The Data Protection Act 2018 and GDPR gives individuals certain rights and for your convenience these are listed below:-
You have the right to access a copy of the personal information we hold about you by making a Subject Access Request (SAR). You can do this by phone, in writing or by email to the address at the bottom of this policy.
We will have to verify your identity before we can proceed.
You have the right of rectification to amend or update your personal information and ensure we maintain accurate and up-to-date records and/or data about you.
You have the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’.
The broad principle underpinning this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing by Mortons.
You have the right to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal data. Processing of your personal information may be restricted in the event it is no longer essential to support the use of services provided to you and/or not part of any contractual, legal or financial requirement to do so. Mortons is permitted to store the personal data, but not further process it.
Mortons may retain just enough information about you to ensure that any restriction is respected in future.
You have the right to data portability, which allows individuals to obtain and/or reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. It allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability.
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information based on consent, our legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest or exercise of official authority including profiling activity, direct marketing, including profiling activity, and processing for purposes of scientific and/or historical research and statistics.
You have the right to be made aware of any automated decision-making, that is decisions made about you without any human involvement, and also any profiling that may take place about you.
You have an absolute right to ask us to stop sending you direct mail or email.
For some processing you will have given us permission to process your information, and in these cases you can withdraw your consent at any time. In certain situations, the above rights may not apply, for example if you entered into a membership minimum term contract, we may have to write to you about your membership even if you asked us previously not to, but we would not send you direct marketing materials.

However, the data protection legislation allows us to send marketing materials to corporate individuals with whom we have no pre-existing relationship if their information is in the public domain, and that information is relevant to them.
We will therefore always try and obtain opt-in consent before adding a person to our mailing list; and at all times and in all correspondence we will clearly state that we are Mortons Media Group and clearly tell them how they can change or update their marketing preferences or unsubscribe completely.
If you have made contact with us then we shall rely on a combination of your consent, our legitimate interests to record your information, and if we wish to send you administrative or marketing emails, we rely on what is called the soft-opt-in, or pre-existing relationship, to send those emails to you (at any time you can ask us to stop sending these to you).
Right to object
You have an absolute right to ask us to stop processing your information for direct marketing purposes at any time – more of your rights are detailed below.
We will not share or sell your marketing or personal information with any third parties, save with your permission or required by law.
General
For security reasons at our head office in Horncastle. Staff and visitors to the site are recorded and if you would like to know more details please contact Charlotte Park whose details are below.
As a very proactive and forward-thinking organisation we stay up to date with technological advancements and we will continue to embrace new technology such as artificial intelligence, secure home and mobile working and the internet of things.
We shall always ensure that potential privacy risks involved in introducing these new technologies are considered and your safety always put at the forefront of our thoughts, ensuring that adequate technical and organisational security measures are put in place to keep you safe.
Your rights
The Data Protection Act 2018 and GDPR gives individuals certain rights and for your convenience these are listed below:-
You have the right to access a copy of the personal information we hold about you by making a Subject Access Request (SAR). You can do this by phone, in writing or by email to the address at the bottom of this policy.
We will have to verify your identity before we can proceed.
You have the right of rectification to amend or update your personal information and ensure we maintain accurate and up-to-date records and/or data about you.
You have the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’.
The broad principle underpinning this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing by Mortons.
You have the right to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal data. Processing of your personal information may be restricted in the event it is no longer essential to support the use of services provided to you and/or not part of any contractual, legal or financial requirement to do so. Mortons is permitted to store the personal data, but not further process it.
Mortons may retain just enough information about you to ensure that any restriction is respected in future.
You have the right to data portability, which allows individuals to obtain and/or reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. It allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability.
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information based on consent, our legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest or exercise of official authority including profiling activity, direct marketing, including profiling activity, and processing for purposes of scientific and/or historical research and statistics.
You have the right to be made aware of any automated decision-making, that is decisions made about you without any human involvement, and also any profiling that may take place about you.
You have an absolute right to ask us to stop sending you direct mail or email.
For some processing you will have given us permission to process your information, and in these cases you can withdraw your consent at any time. In certain situations, the above rights may not apply, for example if you entered into a membership minimum term contract, we may have to write to you about your membership even if you asked us previously not to, but we would not send you direct marketing materials.

Safeguarding your data
Laws protecting user privacy such as the
European Economic Area’s General Data Protection Regulation
and other privacy laws that establish various rights for applicable US-state residents impact content publishers, application developers, website visitors, and application users. See also
the Google privacy policy
and Google’s site for
customers and partners
. Currently such regulations apply to specific geographic regions, but publishers and application developers often implement controls that affect the experience of users in all regions.
Google is committed to protecting data confidentiality and security. It is important to understand your privacy options, whether in the role of a publisher or a consumer. This page provides information on data collection and security for:
Content publishers and app developers (“customers”) using Google measurement products.
Website visitors and app users (“users”) of sites and apps using Google measurement products.
Data collection
Google customers use tags on web pages and an SDK for mobile apps to enable Google measurement products. The measurement data collected helps customers understand their users’ needs and, optionally, personalize the user experience and offer relevant advertising (see
Advertising personalization
).
Google tags and the SDK use cookies and app instance IDs, respectively, to measure user interaction. While these identifiers provide information about user behavior, Google prohibits customers from sending
Personally Identifiable Information
to Google Analytics. Even so, use of cookies and app IDs falls under the privacy laws mentioned previously. Google customers need to inform users about the information being stored and give them the opportunity to grant or deny their consent.
See the following sections on this page to:

Our privacy policy
At Google, we are keenly aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to keep your privacy and data secure. As part of this responsibility, we let you know what information we collect when you use our products and services, why we collect it, and how we use it to improve your experience. The
Google privacy policy & principles
describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including Google Analytics.
Google Analytics cookies and identifiers
Google Analytics mainly uses first-party cookies to report on visitor (aka. user) interactions on Google Analytics customers’ websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.
Learn more
In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser
add-on
that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Google Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Google Analytics measurement.
Where a site or app uses Google Analytics for Apps or the Google Analytics for Firebase SDKs, Google Analytics collects
an app-instance identifier
— a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset.
Where sites or apps have implemented Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, like Google Ads, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. Users can opt-out of this feature and manage their settings for this cookie using the
Ads Settings
.

Google Analytics under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Google operates as a data processor for Google Analytics. This is reflected in our Ads Data Processing Terms, which are available to all Google Analytics customers with direct contracts with Google.
Learn more
Google Analytics is a data processor under GDPR because Google Analytics collects and processes data on behalf of our clients, pursuant to their instructions. Our customers are data controllers who retain full rights over the collection, access, retention, and deletion of their data at any time. Google’s use of data is controlled by the terms of its contract with Google Analytics customers and any settings enabled by customers through the user interface of our product.
Google Analytics under privacy laws in the United States
In order to help Google Analytics customers prepare for laws that establish various rights for applicable US-state residents, we have updated our
Data Processing Terms
to include a
U.S. State Privacy Laws Service Provider and Processor Addendum
. Subject to the full terms of this addendum, Google Analytics will act as a service provider to its customers (when data sharing with Google products and services is disabled) and as such, will only use data collected on behalf of the customer in Google Analytics to provide the Google Analytics services. Customers who have not accepted our
Data Processing Terms
can do so
per these instructions
. Customers who have already agreed to our
Data Processing Terms
will not need to take additional action to accept the CCPA service provider addendum. Customers should review the
U.S. State Privacy Laws Service Provider and Processor Addendum
, as well as Google Analytics’ use of data, to ensure it meets customer’s compliance needs.
To help customers manage their compliance needs, Google Analytics offers a collection of tools, detailed below, that enable you to control how data is collected, and whether it is used for advertising personalization.
If you have linked Google Analytics to another product, please refer to
Google Analytics linking overview
.
Google Analytics under the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)

Data Collected by Google Analytics
First-party cookies
Google Analytics collects first-party cookies, data related to the device/browser, IP address (when collecting data, Google Analytics 4 does not log or store IP addresses), and on-site/app activities to measure and report statistics about user interactions on the websites and/or apps that use Google Analytics. Customers may customize cookies and the data collected with features like
cookie settings
,
User-ID
,
Data Import
, and
Measurement Protocol
.
Learn more
Google Analytics customers who have for instance, enabled the analytics.js or gtag.js collection method can control whether or not they use cookies to store a pseudonymous or random client identifier. If the customer decides to set a cookie, the information stored in the local first-party cookie is reduced to a random identifier (e.g., 12345.67890).
For customers who use the Google Analytics for Apps SDK, we collect an App Instance Identifier, which is a number that is randomly generated when the user installs an app for the first time.
Advertising identifiers
Where customers use
Google Analytics Advertising Features
, Google advertising cookies are collected and used to enable features like Remarketing on the Google Display Network. These features are subject to the users’
Ads Settings
, the
Policy requirements for Google Analytics Advertising Features
and
Google’s EU User Consent policy
, which requires customers to obtain consent for cookies where legally required—including consent for personalized ads. For more information about how Google uses advertising cookies, visit the
Google Advertising Privacy FAQ
. It is possible to implement Google Analytics without affecting normal data collection where Advertising features are disabled until consent is obtained (see
Privacy Controls in Google Analytics
), as well as prevent certain data from being used for advertising personalization purposes (See
Advertising Personalization below
).
PII prohibition
Our contracts prohibit customers from sending
Personally Identifiable Information
to Google Analytics. Customers should follow these
Best Practices
to ensure PII is not sent to Google Analytics.
What is the data used for?
Google uses Google Analytics data to provide the Google Analytics measurement service to customers. Identifiers such as cookies and app instance IDs are used to measure user interactions with a customer’s sites and/or apps, while IP addresses are used to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give the customer a sense of where in the world their users come from. Customers may also choose to use the data collected by Google Analytics for site/app personalization or advertising purposes, including ads personalization (See
Advertising Personalization below
).
Data access
We do not share Google Analytics data without the customer’s authorization (including via settings in the product user interface), or as otherwise expressly permitted under the terms of their Google Analytics agreement, except in limited circumstances when required by law.
Customers may control their own access to data in their Analytics accounts or properties by configuring view and edit permissions for employees or other representatives who may login to their Analytics account.
Learn more
Security-dedicated engineering teams at Google guard against external threats to data. Internal access to data (e.g., by employees) is limited by strict access controls (both internal policy controls and automated technical controls such as authentication, SSL, and security logs) to only those with a business need to access it.
Product linking summary
Where customers link their Analytics property to another Google product or service account (“Integration Partner”), certain data from that Analytics property may be accessed and exported into the linked account. Once data is exported through a linking integration, it becomes subject to the Integration Partner’s terms and policies.
Note that once data is sent to an Integration Partner, that the data sent is subject to the terms of that Integration Partner and that Google Analytics no longer maintains access or control over that data.
Customers may review and manage their product integration linkings at any time within the Analytics product linking summary user interface.
Data sharing
Google Analytics provides several data sharing settings to customers, through which customers may customize how data collected using an Analytics data collection method (like the JavaScript code, mobile SDKs, and the Measurement Protocol) may be accessed and used by Google according to customer preferences. Note that these settings only apply to data collected from websites, mobile apps, and other digital devices using Analytics; they do not apply to data relating to a customer’s use of Analytics, such as the number of properties and which additional features are configured. Regardless of a customer’s data sharing settings, Analytics data may also be used only insofar as necessary to maintain and protect the Analytics service.

Data Controls for retention, deletion, and portability
Data retention
With the
Data Retention controls
, customers can limit or expand the duration for which their user-level and event-level data is stored in Google Analytics servers. All customers should review their Data Retention settings and ensure the appropriate retention is selected.
User deletion
Customers may delete a single user’s data from Google Analytics by passing a single user identifier to the
Google Analytics User Deletion API
or via our
User Explorer report
. However, this does not delete aggregate data associated with that user, such as page URLs visited.
User-level data access and portability
Customers may pull event information for any given user identifier via our
User Explorer report
or the
User Activity API
. These features enable customers to analyze and export event level data for a single user identifier. In addition, our 360 customers may integrate with BigQuery to create a full export of all event data associated with their users in a single queryable repository.
Advertising personalization
Customers may choose to limit use of their analytics data for advertising personalization purposes, instead of disabling the collection of all analytics data or advertising identifiers (see “
Privacy Controls in Google Analytics
”). Customers may choose to disable Advertising Personalization for data collected from their entire property, or to disable it for individual events or users (for
apps
,
websites
, and
measurement protocol
). Customers using Google Analytics for Firebase or Google Analytics 4 properties may also
exclude specific events or user properties
(like ‘purchase’ or ‘gender’) from being used for Ads Personalization.
If any of 1) all property-level data, 2) individual events, or 3) specific event names or user properties have been excluded from ads personalization, then Analytics will append an additional signal (called ‘npa’) in Postbacks indicating that networks should not use the data for personalized advertising. Note that each network's treatment of such 'npa' signal is determined by such network.
Data privacy and security
Certifications
ISO 27001
Google has earned ISO 27001 certification for the systems, applications, people, technology, processes, and data centers serving a number of Google products, including Google Analytics.
Learn more about our ISO compliance, and download our certificate (PDF)
or

.
Information security
In web-based computing, security of both data and applications is critical. Google dedicates significant resources towards securing applications and data handling to prevent unauthorized access to data.
Data is stored in an encoded format optimized for performance, rather than stored in a traditional file system or database manner. Data is dispersed across a number of physical and logical volumes for redundancy and expedient access, thereby obfuscating it from tampering.
Google applications run in a multi-tenant, distributed environment. Rather than segregating each customer's data onto a single machine or set of machines, data from all Google users (consumers, business, and even Google's own data) is distributed among a shared infrastructure composed of Google's many homogeneous machines and located in Google's data centers.
In addition, Google Analytics ensures secure transmission of its JavaScript libraries and measurement data. Google Analytics by default uses HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs browsers that support HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) to use that encryption protocol for all communication between end users, websites, and Google Analytics servers.

Operational security and disaster recovery
To minimize service interruption due to hardware failure, natural disaster, or other catastrophe, Google implements a comprehensive disaster-recovery program at all of its data centers. This program includes multiple components to eliminate single points of failure, including the following:
Data replication
: To help ensure availability in the event of a disaster, Google Analytics data stored in Google's distributed file system is replicated to separate systems in different data centers.
Geographical distribution of data centers
: Google operates a geographically distributed set of data centers that is designed to maintain service continuity in the event of a disaster or other incident in a single region.
Resilient and redundant infrastructure
: Google's computing clusters are designed with resiliency and redundancy in mind, helping minimize single points of failure and the impact of common equipment failures and environmental risks.
Continuity plan in the event of disaster
: In addition to the redundancy of data and regionally disparate data centers, Google also has a business-continuity plan for its headquarters in Mountain View, CA. This plan accounts for major disasters, such as a seismic event or a public-health crisis, and it assumes people and services may be unavailable for up to 30 days. This plan is designed to enable continued operations of our services for our customers.
