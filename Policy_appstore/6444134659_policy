II. Rights of users and data subjects
With regard to the data processing described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right to
to confirmation as to whether data relating to them is being processed, to information about the data processed, to further information about the data processing and to copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 DSGVO);
correction or completion of inaccurate or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 of the GDPR);

In addition, the provider is obliged to inform all recipients to whom data has been disclosed by the provider of any correction or deletion of data or restriction of processing that takes place on the basis of Articles 16, 17 (1), 18 DSGVO. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Notwithstanding this, the user has a right to information about these recipients.
Likewise, according to Art. 21 DSGVO, users and data subjects have the right to object to the future processing of data concerning them, insofar as the data is processed by the provider in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.
III. Information on data processing
Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage no longer applies, the deletion of the data does not conflict with any legal obligations to retain data and no other information is provided below on individual processing procedures.
SERVER DATA
For technical reasons, in particular to ensure a secure and stable Internet presence, data is transmitted by your Internet browser to us or to our web space provider. These so-called server log files include the type and version of your internet browser, the operating system, the website from which you accessed our website (referrer URL), the website(s) of our website that you visit, the date and time of the respective access as well as the IP address of the internet connection from which our website is used.
The data collected in this way is temporarily stored, but not together with other data about you.
This storage takes place on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality and security of our website.
The data is deleted again after seven days at the latest, unless further storage is required for evidence purposes. Otherwise, the data is exempt from deletion in whole or in part until the final clarification of an incident.
COOKIES
a) Session cookies / session cookies
We use so-called cookies with our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies that are placed and stored on your end device by the Internet browser you use. These cookies are used to process certain information about you on an individual basis, such as your browser or location data or your IP address.
This processing makes our website more user-friendly, effective and secure, as the processing enables, for example, the reproduction of our website in different languages or the offer of a shopping cart function.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit b.) DSGVO, insofar as these cookies data are processed for the purpose of contract initiation or contract processing.
If the processing does not serve to initiate or execute a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
These session cookies are deleted when you close your internet browser.
b) Third-party cookies
Where applicable, cookies from partner companies with which we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analysis or the functionalities of our website are also used with our website.
Please refer to the following information for details on this, in particular the purposes and legal basis of the processing of such third-party cookies.
c) Removal option
You can prevent or restrict the installation of cookies by setting your internet browser. You can also delete cookies that have already been stored at any time. However, the steps and measures required for this depend on the specific Internet browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or documentation of your Internet browser or contact its manufacturer or support. In the case of so-called Flash cookies, however, processing cannot be prevented via the browser settings. Instead, you must change the settings of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the specific Flash player you use. If you have any questions, please also use the help function or documentation of your Flash player or contact the manufacturer or user support.
However, if you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, this may mean that not all functions of our website can be used to their full extent.
CONTRACT PROCESSING
The data transmitted by you in order to make use of our range of goods and/or services is processed by us for the purpose of contract processing and is necessary to this extent. Conclusion and processing of the contract are not possible without the provision of your data.
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.
We delete the data once the contract has been fully processed, but in doing so we must observe the retention periods under tax and commercial law.
Within the scope of contract processing, we pass on your data to the transport company commissioned with the delivery of goods or to the financial service provider, insofar as the transfer is necessary for the delivery of goods or for payment purposes.
The legal basis for the transfer of data is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.
CUSTOMER ACCOUNT / REGISTRATION FUNCTION
If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will collect and store the data you enter during registration (e.g. your name, address or e-mail address) exclusively for pre-contractual services, for the fulfilment of the contract or for the purpose of customer care (e.g. to provide you with an overview of your previous orders with us or to be able to offer you the so-called memo function). At the same time, we also store your IP address and the date of your registration together with the time of day. Of course, this data will not be passed on to third parties.
Within the scope of the further registration process, your consent to this processing will be obtained and reference will be made to this data protection declaration. The data collected by us in this process will be used exclusively for the provision of the customer account.
Insofar as you consent to this processing, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO is the legal basis for the processing.
If the opening of the customer account also serves pre-contractual measures or the fulfilment of the contract, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO.
In accordance with Art. 7 (3) DSGVO, you can revoke your consent to the opening and maintenance of the customer account at any time with effect for the future. To do so, you only need to inform us of your revocation.
The data collected in this respect will be deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary. However, we must observe retention periods under tax and commercial law.
CREDITWORTHINESS CHECK AND SCORING
Insofar as we offer you the basic option of payment by invoice within the scope of our range of goods or services and you make use of this option, we reserve the right to obtain credit information from a credit agency (such as Creditreform, Schufa, Bürgel or infoscore) on the basis of mathematical-statistical procedures. For this purpose, your data, insofar as it is relevant to the contract, such as your name and address, will be forwarded to the credit agency. We use the subsequent information about the statistical probability of a payment default for our decision whether to offer you payment by invoice.
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in the security of the claim in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
NEWSLETTER
If you register for our free newsletter, the data requested by you for this purpose, i.e. your e-mail address and - optionally - your name and address, will be transmitted to us. At the same time, we store the IP address of the Internet connection from which you access our website as well as the date and time of your registration. During the further registration process, we will ask for your consent to send you the newsletter, describe the content in detail and refer to this data protection declaration. We use the data collected exclusively for sending the newsletter - in particular, it is therefore not passed on to third parties.
The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO.
In accordance with Art. 7 (3) DSGVO, you can revoke your consent to receive the newsletter at any time with effect for the future. To do so, you simply need to inform us of your revocation or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each newsletter.
CONTACT REQUESTS / CONTACT OPTIONS
If you contact us via the contact form or e-mail, the data you provide will be used to process your enquiry. The provision of the data is necessary for the processing and answering of your enquiry - without their provision we cannot answer your enquiry or at best only to a limited extent.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.
Your data will be deleted as soon as your enquiry has been finally answered and there are no legal obligations to retain data, e.g. in the case of subsequent contract processing.
USER CONTRIBUTIONS, COMMENTS AND RATINGS
We offer you the opportunity to publish questions, answers, opinions or evaluations, hereinafter referred to as "contributions", on our Internet pages. If you make use of this offer, we process and publish your contribution, the date and time of submission as well as the pseudonym used by you, if applicable.
The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO. In accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 DSGVO, you can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. To do so, you only need to inform us of your revocation.
In addition, we also process your IP and e-mail address. The IP address is processed because we have a legitimate interest in initiating or supporting further steps if your contribution infringes the rights of third parties and/or it is otherwise illegal.
The legal basis in this case is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the legal defence that may be necessary.
SUBSCRIPTION TO CONTRIBUTIONS
If you publish contributions on our website, we also offer you the option of subscribing to any follow-up contributions by third parties. In order to be able to inform you about these follow-up contributions by e-mail, we process your e-mail address.
The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO. In accordance with Art. 7 (3) DSGVO, you can revoke your consent to this subscription at any time with effect for the future. To do so, you simply need to inform us of your revocation or click on the unsubscribe link contained in the respective e-mail.
ONLINE JOB APPLICATIONS / PUBLICATION OF JOB ADVERTISEMENTS
We offer you the opportunity to apply for a job with us via our website. In the case of these digital applications, your applicant and application data will be collected and processed electronically by us for the purpose of handling the application process.
The legal basis for this processing is § 26 para. 1 p. 1 BDSG in conjunction with. Art. 88 para. 1 DSGVO.
If an employment contract is concluded after the application process, we will store the data you submitted during the application in your personnel file for the purpose of the usual organisational and administrative process - of course in compliance with the more extensive legal obligations.
The legal basis for this processing is also § 26 para. 1 p. 1 BDSG in conjunction with. Art. 88 para. 1 DSGVO.
If an application is rejected, we automatically delete the data provided to us two months after notification of the rejection. However, the deletion does not take place if the data requires longer storage of up to four months or until the conclusion of legal proceedings due to legal provisions, e.g. due to the obligation to provide evidence according to the AGG.
In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO and § 24 para. 1 no. 2 BDSG. Our legitimate interest lies in the legal defence or enforcement.
If you expressly consent to your data being stored for a longer period of time, e.g. for your inclusion in a database of applicants or interested parties, the data will be processed on the basis of your consent. The legal basis is then Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO. However, you can of course revoke your consent at any time in accordance with Art. 7 Para. 3 DSGVO by making a declaration to us with effect for the future.
WINNER GAME
We offer you the opportunity to participate in competitions via our website. If you participate in one of our competitions, the data you enter when participating will be processed without your further consent, but of course exclusively for the purpose of carrying out and processing the respective competition.
As part of the processing of the competition, we pass on your data to the transport company commissioned with the delivery of the goods or to a financial service provider, insofar as the transfer is necessary for the delivery or payment of your prize.

In accordance with Art. 7 (3) DSGVO, you can revoke your consent to the processing of data for participation in our competitions at any time with effect for the future. To do so, you only need to inform us of your revocation.

In this respect, we would like to point out that there is a possibility that user data may be processed outside the European Union, in particular in the USA.

FACEBOOK
To advertise our products and services and to communicate with interested parties or customers, we operate a company presence on the Facebook platform.

When our online presence is called up on the Facebook platform, data of the user (e.g. personal information, IP address, etc.) is processed by Facebook Ireland Ltd. as operator of the platform in the EU.
This user data is used for statistical information about the use of our company presence on Facebook. Facebook Ireland Ltd. uses this data for market research and advertising purposes and to create profiles of the users. On the basis of these profiles, Facebook Ireland Ltd. is able, for example, to advertise users within and outside of Facebook according to their interests.

The data protection officer of Instagram can be reached via a contact form:
https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/540977946302970
We have regulated the joint responsibility in an agreement regarding the respective obligations within the meaning of the GDPR. This agreement, from which the mutual obligations arise, can be accessed at the following link:
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum
The legal basis for the processing of personal data that takes place as a result and is reproduced below is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, communication, sales and advertising of our products and services.

When our online presence is called up on the Instagram platform, the user's data (e.g. personal information, IP address, etc.) is processed by Facebook Ireland Ltd. as the operator of the platform in the EU.
This user data is used for statistical information about the use of our company presence on Instagram.

It is not excluded that processing by Facebook Ireland Ltd. also takes place via Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025 in the USA.
Linking social media via graphic or text link
We also promote presences on the social networks listed below on our website. The integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective network. The use of this linked graphic prevents a connection from being automatically established to the respective server of the social network when a website with a social media advertisement is called up in order to display a graphic of the respective network itself. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic is the user redirected to the service of the respective social network.
After the user has been forwarded, information about the user is collected by the respective network. It cannot be ruled out that the data collected in this way will be processed in the USA.
This is initially data such as IP address, date, time and page visited. If the user is logged into his or her user account of the respective network during this time, the network operator may be able to assign the collected information of the user's specific visit to the user's personal account. If the user interacts via a "Share" button of the respective network, this information may be stored in the user's personal user account and may be published. If the user wants to prevent the collected information from being directly assigned to his/her user account, he/she must log out before clicking on the graphic. In addition, it is possible to configure the respective user account accordingly.
The following social networks are integrated into our site by linking:

GOOGLE ANALYTICS
We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analysis service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereinafter referred to as "Google".
The Google Analytics service is used to analyse the usage behaviour of our website. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our website.
Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, location, time or frequency of visits to our website, is transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymisation function. This function enables Google to truncate the IP address within the EU or EEA.
The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and of the usage activities there. This data may also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and the use of the internet.
Google states that it will not associate your IP address with any other data. In addition, Google keeps a record of your IP address at
https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners
Google provides you with further information on data protection law, e.g. on the possibilities of preventing the use of data.
In addition, Google offers a website at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
offers a so-called deactivation add-on together with further information on this. This add-on can be installed with the usual Internet browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you access our website. The add-on informs the JavaScript (ga.js) of Google Analytics that information about your visit to our website should not be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services. If and which other web analytics services are used by us, you will of course also find out in this privacy policy.
YOUTUBE
We use YouTube on our website. This is a video portal of YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, hereinafter referred to as "YouTube".
YouTube is a subsidiary of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereinafter referred to as "Google".
We use YouTube in connection with the "extended data protection mode" function in order to be able to show you videos. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website. According to YouTube, the "enhanced data protection mode" function means that the data described in more detail below is only transmitted to the YouTube server when you actually start a video.
Without this "extended data protection", a connection to the YouTube server in the USA is established as soon as you call up one of our Internet pages on which a YouTube video is embedded.
This connection is necessary in order to be able to display the respective video on our website via your internet browser. In the course of this, YouTube will at least record and process your IP address, the date and time as well as the website you visited. In addition, a connection to Google's "DoubleClick" advertising network is established.
If you are logged into YouTube at the same time, YouTube will assign the connection information to your YouTube account. If you wish to prevent this, you must either log out of YouTube before visiting our website or make the appropriate settings in your YouTube user account.
For the purpose of functionality and to analyse user behaviour, YouTube permanently stores cookies on your end device via your internet browser. If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the storage of cookies by making a setting in your internet browser. You can find more information on this above under "Cookies".
Google provides further information on the collection and use of data as well as your rights and protection options in this regard in the privacy policy published at
https://policies.google.com/privacy

GOOGLE ADWORDS WITH CONVERSION TRACKING
In our website, we use the advertising component Google AdWords and the so-called conversion tracking. This is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereinafter referred to as "Google".
We use conversion tracking for the targeted advertising of our offer. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our website.
If you click on an ad placed by Google, the conversion tracking we use saves a cookie on your terminal device. These so-called conversion cookies lose their validity after 30 days and do not serve to identify you personally.
If the cookie is still valid and you visit a specific page of our website, both we and Google can evaluate the fact that you have clicked on one of our advertisements placed with Google and that you have subsequently been redirected to our website.
Google uses the information obtained in this way to create statistics for us about visits to our website. In addition, this provides us with information about the number of users who clicked on our ad(s) and about the pages of our website that were subsequently accessed. However, neither we nor third parties who also use Google AdWords are able to identify you in this way.
You can also prevent or restrict the installation of cookies through the corresponding settings of your internet browser. At the same time, you can delete cookies already stored at any time. However, the steps and measures required for this depend on your specific Internet browser used. If you have any questions, please use the help function or documentation of your Internet browser or contact its manufacturer or support.
Furthermore, Google also offers the following website
https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html
https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/
http://www.google.de/policies/privacy/
for further information on this topic and in particular on the possibilities of preventing the use of data.
GOOGLE REMARKETING OR "SIMILAR TARGET GROUPS" COMPONENT FROM GOOGLE
We use the remarketing or "similar target groups" function on our website. This is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereinafter referred to as "Google".
We use this function to display interest-based, personalised advertising on third-party websites that also participate in Google's advertising network.
The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our website.
In order to enable this advertising service, Google stores a cookie with a numerical sequence on your terminal device during your visit to our website via your internet browser. This cookie records both your visit and the use of our website in anonymised form. However, no personal data is passed on in the process. If you subsequently visit the website of a third party that also uses the Google advertising network, advertisements may appear that relate to our website or our offers there.
To permanently deactivate this function, Google offers the following option for the most common internet browsers via
https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin
for the most common internet browsers.
The use of cookies from certain providers can also be deactivated, e.g. via
http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices
or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
can be deactivated by opting out.
Through cross-device marketing, Google may be able to track your usage behaviour across multiple devices, so that you may be shown interest-based, personalised advertising even if you switch devices. However, this requires that you have consented to the linking of your browsing history with your existing Google account.
Google provides further information on Google Remarketing at

SHOPIFY (SHOP SOFTWARE + WEB ANALYSIS)
a) Shopify shop software
We use "Shopify" to host our shop system and to present our offers and process contracts.
The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) DSGVO (contract initiation/contract processing).
"Shopify" is the service of a group of companies consisting of Shopify Data Processing (USA) Inc, Shopify Payments (USA) Inc, Shopify (USA) Inc, Shopify Commerce Singapore Pte. Ltd. and Shopify International Limited.
Where we are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), processing is carried out by Shopify International Limited, Victoria Buildings, 2nd Floor, 1-2 Haddington Road, Dublin 4, D04 XN32, Ireland, hereinafter referred to only as "Shopify".
However, due to the group of companies, it cannot be ruled out that processing also takes place in Canada and the USA, i.e. outside the EEA. In the case of data transfer to the Canadian Shopify Inc., however, an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed by the adequacy decision of the European Commission.
Shopify processes the following data on our behalf:
Name, billing and, if applicable, delivery address, email address, payment data, company name if applicable, telephone number if applicable, IP address, information about orders, information about the merchant shops supported by Shopify that you visit, as well as information about your terminal device and your internet browser.
In addition, Shopify offers the following at
https://www.shopify.de/legal/datenschutz
for more detailed data protection information.
b) Shopify web analytics
Insofar as we also use the Shopify web analytics service on our website, Shopify stores cookies on your end device via your internet browser. Via these cookies, further information, such as the location, time or frequency of your visit to our website, is transmitted to a Shopify server and analysed.
The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis and optimisation of our website.
If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the storage of the cookie by means of a setting in your internet browser. You can find more information on this above under "Cookies".
KLARNA "CHECK-OUT
For the payment processing of orders via our online shop, we use the payment service of Klarna Bank AB, Sveavägen 46, 111 34 Stockholm, Sweden, hereinafter referred to as "Klarna".
For this purpose, we have integrated the so-called check-out of Klarna into the final order page of our online shop.
The legal basis is the fulfilment of the contract according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b.) DSGVO. In addition, we have a legitimate interest in offering effective and secure payment options, so that a further legal basis follows from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f.) DSGVO.
By integrating Klarna, your internet browser loads the check-out page from a Klarna server. The operating system you use, the type and version of your Internet browser, the Internet page from which the check-out was requested, the date and time of the request and the IP address are transmitted to Klarna - even without you interacting with the check-out page.
As soon as you complete the order in our online shop, the data you enter in the input fields of the check-out page will be processed by Klarna on its own responsibility to process the payment.
In the case of the payment methods offered "PayPal" and "Prepayment", the processing is limited to the forwarding of the payment data to us or PayPal without your further consent.
In the case of the offered payment methods "purchase on account", "hire purchase", "credit card", "direct debit" or "instant bank transfer", the following personal data in particular will be processed by Klarna for the purpose of payment processing as well as for identity and creditworthiness checks:
- Contact information, such as names, addresses, date of birth, gender, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, IP address, etc.
- Order processing information, such as product type, product number, price, etc.
- Payment information, such as debit and credit card details (card number, expiry date and CCV code), billing details, account number, etc.
In the event that you select the payment method "purchase on account" or "hire purchase", Klarna collects and uses personal data and information about your previous payment behaviour in order to decide whether to grant you the desired payment method. In addition, probability values for your future payment behaviour (so-called scoring) are used. The scoring is calculated on the basis of scientifically recognised mathematical-statistical methods.
