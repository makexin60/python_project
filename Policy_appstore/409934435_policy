Interests Data
Languages spoken, favorite CHANEL products, interests, information saved to your CHANEL account, information from your interactions with different features and services that we offer digitally or instore (for example but not limited to: La Collection, Virtual Try On), and engagement with marketing campaigns.
When you interact with our digital or instore services, you might have the option to engage in different journeys:
If you have a CHANEL account and you sign-in as part of interacting with our digital or instore services, we will use the data collected during your instore or online digital experience to: (i) to send you product recommendations, advertising and relevant promotions, in accordance with your preferences (see the Marketing-Related Purposes below); (ii) to understand your preferences (see the Preference-Related purposes below); and (iii) to improve our tools, technologies and services.
Some of our experiences may enable individuals to participate in a “non-identifiable manner”, without providing their name and contact details, or without registering for or signing into a CHANEL account.
If you participate in one of our experiences, instore or digitally, in this way, we may retain certain personal data (including, for example, your contact information, results of your experience, Image Data, etc.) about you temporarily, for no longer than 48 hours. This is so that you can access the results of the experience after completing it, and save them to your CHANEL account, should you wish to do so. Once the temporary period has expired, we will delete your personal information, (e.g., your image data and email addresses) and will not be able to link the results of your experience to you.
During this temporary period, we will use a “session ID” to retrieve your experience information if you want to access it and link it to your account. A session ID is a random collection of letters and numbers, and will not relate to your personal information.
If you participate in one of our digital or instore experiences (including in this "non-identifiable” way), CHANEL will keep certain results from your participation in the instore or digital experience (e.g., skincare routine characteristics, product usage details, or qualitative skin expressions as vitality or smoothness) to be used by CHANEL for product development and service enhancement purposes. This information will not identify you.
Additional data may be collected for VIP clients (e.g. hobbies, food and beverage preference, boutique experience preference, etc., social influence (friend with other CHANEL clients, VIP client of other brands).
If you are involved in the creative, arts, or journalistic industries, including where you are in a corporate role in one of these industries, we may collect your personal data from publicly available sources, or through referrals, for the purposes of reaching out to you or building a relationship with you.
Third-Party Data
From time to time we may collect Data about you from third party partners or instruct such third party partners to provide their own Data about you to external platforms in order to (i) enrich our data sets so that we can provide you with tailored information about our products, services and events on external platforms or via such third parties, as well as (ii) to perform CHANEL brand monitoring.
When you have given a third party permission to share with CHANEL the information they hold about you either or directly or indirectly. For example, where you have been targeted with advertising content relating to CHANEL as a result of targeting criteria we have agreed with a third party publisher or social media provider.
Anti-Counterfeit and Anti-Infringement Data
(Information on parties to fight counterfeiting and infringements of CHANEL's intellectual property rights)
In order to fight against counterfeit and infringement, CHANEL has set up processes to collect and store information on companies or individuals who commit or are likely to commit acts that violate our intellectual property rights. We collect and store the following Anti-Counterfeit and Anti-Infringement Data: identification data, postal address, email addresses, domain names, telephone numbers, social media handles and usernames, and other information related to counterfeit and infringing activities, together with any documents and information relating to court proceedings. This Anti-Counterfeit and Anti-Infringement Data may be collected by CHANEL or one of its agents on its behalf, from open sources, or provided to CHANEL by external parties, including government authorities. In addition, CHANEL periodically monitors social media sites and other online platforms/websites, as well as offline points of sales, to detect unauthorized sellers of CHANEL products.
CHANEL may share this Anti-Counterfeit and Anti-Infringement Data with third parties, including government authorities and its agents and advisors, for the purpose of investigating counterfeiting and infringing activity and taking action to prevent the infringement of CHANEL’s intellectual property rights.
Data for the management of CHANEL authorized/owned distribution networks
CHANEL needs to enforce its authorized/owned distribution networks, to protect the CHANEL brand and identify unauthorized resellers. To this purpose, CHANEL carries out profiling activities on customers by analyzing purchase behaviors according to objective criteria. CHANEL collects the following data for this purpose: identification data, name, purchase history (including products, volumes purchased and sizes), delivery address, location of boutique, payment method. In addition, CHANEL periodically monitors social media sites and other online platforms/websites, as well as offline points of sales, to detect unauthorized sellers of CHANEL products. Some Data is also collected from authorized resellers.
In the event an unauthorized reseller is identified, a flag may appear on its customer profile, which will restrict access on certain services and/or sales for a period of 2 years. There is no automated decision based on profiling.
Health Data linked to our products and services (e.g. cosmetics)
In order to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, and to address customer claims, CHANEL will collect through a dedicated questionnaire limited health information (e.g. skin type, allergies, previous reactions). A specific information notice will be provided to you in such case.
Image Data
(may be categorized as biometric data differently depending on the jurisdiction)
Photographs: CHANEL may collect photographs and image data, for example at events or when you visit our boutiques, or where you send such image data to us.
Facial patterns and other image data: In the context of our digital or instore virtual try-on experiences, including Chanel Vitality Scanner and / or  other experiences, image data will be used to determine whether facial or skin patterns are present, and the parameters of those facial patterns.
CHANEL does not store this type of data as standard. However, customers have the chance, if they choose to do so, and upon their consent, to store their image or recordings collected depending on the experience they had selected in their CHANEL account. This type of data is retained in accordance with local laws and guidelines. Users have the chance to delete it at any time.
Where you choose to save your image to your CHANEL account, we will store your image in order to provide you access to your image through your CHANEL account. No facial characteristics are measured or collected.
General Contact and Request Data
(Information collected when you otherwise interact with us)
Type of relationship with CHANEL (e.g., customer, employee or other), last name, first name, type of request (e.g., personal information rectification or deletion request, or a request related to CHANEL products or services, including where you interact with us through our Customer Care Centre and any chat function), further request details necessary to process your request (e.g. identification details), and the content of your request provided to us (which may include recordings and/or transcripts of any phone calls, where applicable), and any responses you may provide to us through any questionnaires or surveys.
