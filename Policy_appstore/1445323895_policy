After you make an account deletion request, we permanently and irreversibly delete your personal information from our systems, including backups. Once deleted, your data cannot be reinstated. Following your deletion of your account, it may take up to 45 days to delete your personal information from our systems. Additionally, we may retain information where deletion requests are made to comply with the law and take other actions permitted by law.
Note that we do not have control over resume content you have shared directly with others on other media platforms, or that others may have copied from the Resume Hosting feature.

Your public Resume Hosting resume may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.
Children's Privacy
Our services are not intended for, nor directed to, children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anybody under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not use the Services.
How We Protect Information
CV Engineer implements technical, physical, and organizational measures and controls to safeguard and protect the transmission and storage of the data we collect. We employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity. Please be aware that despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your account or information. In addition, you can take steps to protect your account and information such as creating a unique password for CV Engineer that is not easily guessed and that you don't use anywhere else, not sharing your password with others, and promptly reporting suspicious activity or unauthorized account access.
Your Rights and Our Legal Bases
We provide the same suite of privacy controls to all of our users worldwide. Particular rights may be available to you if you reside in certain locations, such as the EEA, Brazil or certain U.S. states such as California.
Your legal rights in the EEA
If you reside in the EEA, you have the right to access, rectify, download or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. CV Engineer's lead supervisory authority in the EEA is the Information Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom.
Our legal bases
CV Engineer relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:
As necessary to provide the Services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the
Terms of Service
. For example, we cannot provide the Services unless we collect and use your contact and resume information;
Where you have consented to the processing;
Where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;
To protect your vital interests, or those of others, such as in the case of emergencies; and
Where necessary for the purposes of CV Engineer's or a third party's legitimate interests, such as our interests in protecting our users, our partners' interests in collaborating with our users, and our commercial interests in ensuring the sustainability of the Services.
Cross Border Data Transfers
The Services are operated from the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States, as it is necessary to provide the Services and perform the
Terms of Service
.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use legal mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to ensure data transfers comply with applicable law.
Retention of Information
We retain information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information. Information associated with your account will generally be kept until it is no longer necessary to provide the Services or until your account is deleted or becomes inactive. In making these determinations, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the purposes for which the information is processed, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.
In addition, you can delete some items of information (e.g., contact and resume information) from view on the Services without deleting your account. Following your deletion of your account, it may take up to 45 days to fully delete your personal information and system logs from our systems. Additionally, we may retain information to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the
Terms of Service
and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information connected to you that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our Services to you may be de-identified or aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights that are commercially valuable to CV Engineer, such as statistics of the use of the Services. This information will be de-associated from your name and other identifiers.
Privacy Policy Updates
CV Engineer reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Please review it occasionally. If CV Engineer makes changes to this Privacy Policy, the updated Privacy Policy will be posted in a timely manner. If you object to any changes to this Privacy Policy, you should stop using the Services and delete your account.
