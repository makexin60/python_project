Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information.
                    Customers can access the PDFfiller service (the “
Service
”) through our website www.PDFfiller.com,
                    applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “
Device
” is any computer used to access
                    the PDFfiller Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer
                    electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the PDFfiller Service, regardless of how you access
                    it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other
                    uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below
                    are collectively referred to as “information.”
Our Privacy Policy explains:
What information we collect and why we collect it.
How we use that information.
It is our policy to respect the privacy of our customers regarding any information that we may collect while
                    operating our website and our mobile products.
1. What Personal Information Does PDFfiller Collect and Store?
Personal Information You Provide to Us.
The types of Personal Information collected may include customers’
                    username, email address, fax number, name of the file faxed/emailed/printed/stored, and browser/mobile device
                    information.
Payment details
. Customers’ payments are processed directly through paypal or through a credit card processing
                    company. We do not have access to and do not store our customers’ credit card or paypal payment information.
Files.
We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the PDFfiller’s Service (“Files”).
                    Files filled out by customers are stored on the server. However, these files and the customers information contained
                    therein are accessible only to the customers of the account in which they are stored. The data contained in these
                    files is encrypted and is unreadable and unusable for anyone else including PDFfiller. Customers have the option to
                    remove a filled out form at any point, which removes all the information from our servers. Files contained in an
                    account without a paid subscription will be automatically deleted in 30 days.
Log Data.
When you use the Service, we (ourselves or using third party services) automatically record some
                    information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services, which can sometimes be correlated
                    with Personal Information. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web
                    page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences,
                    identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with
                    transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the
                    Service.
Cookies.
We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file
                    that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for
                    future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better
                    understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.
                    You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting
                    a cookie from the websites you visit.
Geo-Location Information.
Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for
                    example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you
                    download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your
                    consent to improve our Services. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can
                    sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.
2. How we use information we collect?
Personal Information
is or may be used: (i) to set up an account and profile and to securely access their
                    PDFfiller account, (ii) to administer your use of the Service and to provide and improve our Service, (iii) to
                    better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or
                    offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please
                    follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or send us an email at
                    mailto:support@pdffiller.com.
PDFfiller discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
                    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
                    PDFfiller 's behalf or to provide services available at PDFfiller 's website and mobile platforms, and (ii) that
                    have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
                    located outside of USA; by using PDFfiller 's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
                    them.
Log Data and Cookies
are or maybe used in aggregate form. We use this information for the above purposes and
                    to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s
                    functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify customers have the authorization needed for the Service to
                    process their requests. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively,
                    use our site, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service
Records of Communication. When you contact PDFfiller, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any
                    issues you might be facing. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
                    mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
                    support other customers.
PDFfiller Customer Emails
. PDFfiller may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
                    solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with PDFfiller and our products.
Foreign Processing
. PDFfiller processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the
                    world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.
Retention of Records.
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except
                    where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects
                    information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our
                    services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from
                    our backup systems.
3. Disclosure of Information
For legal reasons.
We may disclose to parties outside PDFfiller, files stored in your PDFfiller account and
                    information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
                    (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or
                    serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of PDFfiller or its customers; or (d) to protect PDFfiller’s
                    property rights. If we provide your PDFfiller files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove
                    PDFfiller’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, PDFfiller will not be able
                    to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on PDFfiller.
Business Transfers.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets,
                    your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email
                    and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or
                    if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding
                    the information.
Non-private or Non-Personal Information.
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information
                    publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share
                    information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
4. Changing or Deleting Your Information
If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your
                    registration or account profile by changing information in your “My Account” page. If your personally identifiable
                    information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on
                    your

page. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by
                    law. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact support@pdffiller.com. We will
                    respond to your inquiry within 30 days.
5. Data and File Retention
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Once your
                    subscription expires, your files will be deleted automatically within 30 days. If you wish to cancel your account or
                    request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account by visiting
http://MyAccount
. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
                    obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete
                    your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information
                    from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers
                    files that you have in common with other customers.
6. PDFfiller for Corporate Customers
If you have a Corporate PDFfiller account, your Administrator may be able to:
access information in and about your PDFfiller for Business account;
disclose, restrict, or access information that you have provided or that is made available to you when using your PDFfiller Corporate account; and
control how your PDFfiller Corporate account may be accessed or deleted
Please refer to your organization's policies if you have questions about your Administrator's rights.
7. Third Party Applications.
Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by airSlate, Inc. and its affiliates, including services
                    offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies
                    that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites
                    that may be displayed to you in our PDF Search Engine search results, sites that may include PDFfiller’s services,
                    or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other
                    companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
                    to serve and offer relevant ads.
We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access
                    our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so
                    you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.
8. Enforcement
We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will
                    contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities,
                    including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that
                    we cannot resolve with our customers directly.
9. Privacy Policy Changes
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without
                    your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we
                    will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy
                    changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
10. Security
The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card
                    number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology
                    (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission
                    and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we
                    cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us
                    at
http://support@pdffiller.com

                    from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal
                    Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at
support@pdffiller.com
.
                    If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete
                    such information from our files.
