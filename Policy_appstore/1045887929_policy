Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting Dorsal and its privacy policy. This privacy policy tells you how we use personal
              information collected at this site and the Dorsal apps. Please read this privacy policy before using the
              site or submitting any personal information or reports. By using the site and Dorsal mobile applications,
              you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. You are encouraged to review the privacy
              policy whenever you visit the site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide
              will be used.
Note: the privacy practices set forth in this privacy policy are for this website and the Dorsal app only .
              If you link to other websites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites.
Collection of Information
We collect personally identifiable information, including, names, email addresses and phone numbers when
              voluntarily submitted by our visitors. The information you provide is primarily used for the purpose of our
              moderating team having the ability to verify shark reports submitted to Dorsal. You are under no obligation
              to provide us with personal information of any kind, however your refusal to do so may prevent you from
              using certain features of the site and our mobile applications.
We may use the Personal Information we collect or receive through the service for the purposes identified
              below:
To verify public shark reports.
To send email newsletters in which you will have the option to opt-out at any time.
To communicate with you about your account and provide customer support.
To provide suggestions to you and to provide tailored features within our service that optimise and personalise your experience.
To deliver marketing information, product recommendations and non-transactional communications (e.g., email, SMS, or push notifications) about us.
Location Based Information
We may use GPS technology (or other similar technologies) to determine your current location in order to
              provide you with accurate shark alerts that are nearby your GPS. When you submit a shark report, we have
              access to the location that you submitted the shark report. This is an important part of our shark reporting
              verification system. By doing this we can maintain accurate shark reports and eliminate misleading of false
              shark reports and statements. We will not share your current location with other users or partners.
Internet-Based Advertising
We may use third-party software to serve ads on the site [and our mobile application], implement email
              marketing campaigns, and manage other interactive marketing initiatives. This third-party software may use
              cookies or similar tracking technology to help manage and optimise your online experience with us.
Cookie/Tracking Technology
The site and app may use cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered. Cookie and
              tracking technology are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking
              the number of visitors to the site, and understanding how visitors use the site. Cookies can also help
              customise the site for visitors. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking
              technology, however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to
              such information. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.
Distribution of Information
We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud prevention or
              investigation. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or
              prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorised transactions; or, (3) investigating fraud which has
              already taken place. The information is not provided to these companies for marketing purposes.
Commitment to Data Security
Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorised employees, agents and contractors
              (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this information. All emails
              and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of further mailings.
How to Access and Control Your Information
You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices,
              how to exercise them and any limitations.
Your Choices
You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information
              (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information,
              or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools
              and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the
              Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are
              administered for you by an administrator (see “Notice to End Users” below), you may need to contact
              your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as
              provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would
              reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator
              are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data
              with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party
              service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved
              concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live,

              where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.
Access and update your information
Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to access and update certain information about
              you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search
              for content containing information about you using keyword searches in the Service. You can update your profile
              information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing
              tools associated with that content.
Deactivate your account
If you no longer wish to use our Services, please contact our support team at
info@dorsalwatch.com
. Please be aware that deactivating your account
              does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past
              participation within the Services. For more information on how to delete your information, see below.
Delete your information
Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within
              the Service. For example, you can request our support team at
info@dorsalwatch.com
to remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain
              information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.
Request that we stop using your information
In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe
              we don’t have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your
              permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.
              Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent,
              but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your
              information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to
              investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using
              your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved,
              provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a
              third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.
Updates
We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will indicate
              at the top of the Privacy Statement when it was last updated. Any changes or modifications will be effective
              immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy on the site, and you waive the right to receive specific
              notice of each such change or modification.
