Subject to earlier termination and/or cancellation in accordance with these Terms, these Terms will continue for the initial term as specified in the applicable form of invoice or subscription order, if any, and if no term is specified, the Terms will have an initial term of 12 months commencing on the date you are first provided access to the Muse Service pursuant to the Terms (“
Initial Term
”) and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable invoice or subscription, these Terms will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Term, on the same terms and conditions as the Terms, except for any changes to fees and any modifications Interaxon makes to these Terms, unless either Party terminates and/or cancels the Terms prior to the end of the then-current term.

For clarity, if you are participating in a trial immediately preceding your paid subscription, the first day of your Initial Term will start on the earlier of: a) first day following the end of the Trial Period; and b) the first day of your paid subscription.
9.2 Termination and/or Cancellation.

(a) in accordance with the Payment Processor Terms;
(b) if the other party materially defaults in the performance or observance of any of its obligations under these Terms and does not remedy the default within 15 days after receiving notice;
(c) at the option of either party, if the other party becomes insolvent or bankrupt or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy is appointed for the other party, or if any proceeding in bankruptcy, receivership, or liquidation is instituted against the other party and is not dismissed within 30 days following commencement thereof; or

All sections of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination and/or cancellation will survive termination and/or cancellation including accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, governing law, disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Further, you will have no right to receive any refund of any prepaid amounts if you terminate and/or cancel during the applicable Term or if we terminate and/or cancel for cause.

Limited Warranty For The Muse Headband
Dead on Arrival Products.
If you are the original purchaser of a Muse headband from Interaxon or an authorised Interaxon retailer and the Muse headband is Dead on Arrival (namely, when you first attempted to use the product after opening the box, it demonstrated hardware failure, preventing even basic operability), the Muse headband may be returned by you to us within thirty (30) days of your original purchase.
If we verify that you were the original purchaser of the product and the product was Dead on Arrival, we will offer you the following options at our expense:
(a) ship you a replacement product; or
(b) service the product, in which case you will not have the right of replacement.
To be eligible to return any Dead on Arrival product to us, you must follow the warranty claim process set out below.
Manufacturer Defects.
Your Muse headband is warranted by Interaxon Inc. and/or its affiliates (“
Interaxon
”) to be free of defects in materials or workmanship, under normal use, for a period of one (1) year from the date of your original purchase of the new Muse headband
except to the extent a longer period is required by applicable law (the “
Warranty Period
”). This limited warranty excludes damage resulting from: (i) improper care or handling (including, without limitation, user abuse or proximity to moisture or heat), (ii) accidents, (iii) modification, (iv) unauthorized repairs, (v) use of the Muse headband with accessories, products, services or software applications not expressly approved or provided by Interaxon, (vi) use of the Muse headband in a manner contrary to, or not in accordance with, the documentation, guidelines or instructions provided by Interaxon or (vi) other causes which are not defects in materials or workmanship of the Muse headband.
This warranty does not cover: (a) used or refurbished products; (b) products provided as a “sample”, “AS IS” or “complimentary”; (c) any third party products Interaxon sells; or (d) any accessories for the Muse headband.
The warranty only extends to new Muse headbands purchased by you from Interaxon or an authorised Interaxon retailer.
If there is a covered defect with the Muse headband, Interaxon will, at its discretion, repair (with new or refurbished parts) or replace (with new or refurbished product) your Muse headband free of charge, or will issue you with a refund. The Warranty Period for the repaired or replaced Muse headband will expire upon the expiration of the original Warranty Period (except to the extent Interaxon is expressly required by law to provide you a longer Warranty Period for the repaired or replaced Muse headband).
This warranty is a hardware only warranty that is limited to the Muse headband and does not cover any software made available, shipped, pre-loaded, or distributed by Interaxon or any third party, even if the software is packaged or sold with the product, or available for the product at a later time.
Software license agreements apply to your use of software associated with the Muse headband. The software license for Interaxon proprietary software to be used with the Muse headband is described in the applicable Interaxon end user license agreement.
To be eligible to return any defective
Muse headband
to us, you must follow the warranty claim process set out below.
Warranty Claim Process.
To be eligible to return any
Muse headband
to us, you must have a Dead on Arrival product or a
Muse headband
with a manufacturer’s defect and you must:
(1) prior to shipping the Muse headband to us, contact us through
http://choosemuse.com/pages/contact
and obtain a Return Material Authorisation (RMA) number, shipping address and other instructions.
The RMA number must be included with your Muse headband return
(2) provide us valid proof of your original purchase
(3) package the Muse headband in the original, unmarked packaging together with all accessories, manuals, and documentation (unless otherwise requested by Interaxon)
(4) include a description of the reason for the Muse headband return.
If we determine that there was no valid reason for returning the
Muse headband
to us (i.e. it was not Dead on Arrival or did not have a manufacturer’s defect), we may, at our discretion, refuse to accept the
Muse headband
or return the
Muse headband
to you and charge you a USD$200 handling fee.
Limitation of Liability.
The
Muse headband
is provided “AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS”, and Interaxon hereby disclaims all other warranties, conditions and the provision of or failure to provide support or other services, information, software, and related content through the
Muse headband
or otherwise arising out of the use of the
Muse headband
. This limited warranty is in place of all other express and implied warranties, conditions, representations, or guarantees of any kind (including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality and/or fitness for a particular purpose) which are all hereby excluded and shall have no effect. In no event shall Interaxon or anyone acting on behalf of or with Interaxon (including, without limitation, in relation to the manufacture, supply, distribution, sale, repair or return of the product) be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss or damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of use of the products or functionality, business interruption, loss or corruption of information (including data), or other pecuniary loss)
arising out of the use or inability to use the
Muse headband
even if Interaxon or anyone acting on behalf of Interaxon has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
This limitation is intended to apply and does apply without regard to whether such damages are claimed, asserted or brought in an action or claim in tort, contract, on the warranty, or under any other legal theory. The liability of Interaxon (and any one acting on behalf of or with Interaxon) to you for loss or damage arising under this warranty shall not exceed in aggregate the net purchase price you paid for the product or the cost of replacing the
Muse headband
, whichever is greater.
The foregoing shall not in any way restrict any liability in relation to death or bodily injury or statutory liability for intentional and gross negligent acts or omissions.
No other person or company is authorized to change this warranty.
Some states and countries do not allow limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, or exclusion of all or certain types of damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other additional statutory rights, which vary from state to state or within a particular country. The foregoing is without prejudice to other legal rights that may arise under applicable mandatory legislation. This warranty extends only to new
Muse headband
purchased by you from Interaxon or an authorized Interaxon retailer.

Consumer Rights

Under your Consumer Rights, you are entitled to: (a) a replacement or refund for Muse headband with a major failure, and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage; and (b) have the Muse headband repaired or replaced if the Muse headband fails to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure; and (c) such remedies are in addition to your rights under this limited warranty.
If you are a consumer under the Australian Consumer Law, you may return a defective Muse headband to: (a) the authorized Interaxon retailer from whom you purchased the Muse headband; or (b) Interaxon directly by contacting Interaxon pursuant to the warranty claims process set out above, or by phoning +1 416 598 8989.

When you visit our websites or apps, we may allow some third parties to (such as advertising networks and data analytics companies) collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and apps (such as websites

Various company, product, and service names displayed on our software, services or products may be trademarks or service marks owned by others (the “Third-Party Trademarks”). Your Membership does not give you any license or right to use any Third-Party Trademark.
Your Membership may give you access to links to, and content and data from, third-party websites (“Third Party Content”). We do not endorse any of the Third Party Content. Use of the Third Party Content may be subject to separate legal terms and conditions between you and the third parties.

You must make sure that:
(a)
all User Content is accurate, complete, up-to-date, and compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; and

PERSONAL DATA
To the extent any personal data is submitted by you or we otherwise collect, such personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy (
www.interaxon.com/privacy
) and to applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. What is considered to be personal data is described further in the Privacy Policy and may be defined by applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Generally, personal data is any data related to a natural person who is identified or identifiable – personal data may include the person’s name, email or other address(es), phone number(s), photographs, or other data that could identify the person or be used with other data to identify the user.
If you share information generated through or as part of your Membership with a third party such as a Professional or your employer, you may be able to do so by providing your consent to such third party and/or Interaxon. You may take back or revoke your consent (unless Interaxon has already acted based on it) by submitting a specific revocation request in writing to Interaxon through
http://choosemuse.com/pages/contact
, specifying that you revoke your consent to share information generated through your Membership with the specified third party. Your revocation will take effect, when Interaxon actually receives and processes your request. Interaxon cannot give it retroactive effect, so it will not affect any use or disclosure that occurred in Interaxon’s reliance on your consent prior to revocation. We are not responsible for any use or disclosure of your information by the Professional or another third party.

Should damage to your Muse device not be covered under warranty, or covered under the upgrade policy in accordance with Section 17, and you have an active Membership, you can buy a replacement with preferential pricing.
We have taken every reasonable care in the provision of our software, services and products. However, subject to applicable law, our software, services and products and any content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any express or implied warranties or conditions of any kind.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

TERMINATION AND/OR CANCELLATION
9.1 Term.
Subject to earlier termination and/or cancellation in accordance with these Terms, these Terms will continue for the initial term as specified in the applicable form of invoice or subscription order, if any, and if no term is specified, the Terms will have an initial term of 12 months commencing on the date you are first provided access to the Muse Service pursuant to the Terms (“
Initial Term
”) and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable invoice or subscription, these Terms will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Term, on the same terms and conditions as the Terms, except for any changes to fees and any modifications Interaxon makes to these Terms, unless either Party terminates and/or cancels the Terms prior to the end of the then-current term.

For clarity, if you are participating in a trial immediately preceding your paid subscription, the first day of your Initial Term will start on the earlier of: a) first day following the end of the Trial Period; and b) the first day of your paid subscription.
9.2 Termination and/or Cancellation.
These Terms will terminate in each of the following events:
(a) in accordance with the Payment Processor Terms;
(b) if the other party materially defaults in the performance or observance of any of its obligations under these Terms and does not remedy the default within 15 days after receiving notice;
(c) at the option of either party, if the other party becomes insolvent or bankrupt or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy is appointed for the other party, or if any proceeding in bankruptcy, receivership, or liquidation is instituted against the other party and is not dismissed within 30 days following commencement thereof; or
(d) at the option of either party, upon 30 days written notice, delivered to the other Party in accordance with Section 10.1 (Notices), provided that no amounts previously paid are refundable.

All sections of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination and/or cancellation will survive termination and/or cancellation including accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, governing law, disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Further, you will have no right to receive any refund of any prepaid amounts if you terminate and/or cancel during the applicable Term or if we terminate and/or cancel for cause. If the Sensor Device and the Muse Service were acquired as a “bundle”, upon termination or expiration of these Terms, notwithstanding Interaxon’s Limited Warranty for the Sensor Device, Interaxon may be relieved of its obligations to repair or replace the Sensor Device.
9.4 Payments Due before Termination and/or Cancellation.
Payments due before the termination and/or cancellation of the Terms will still be payable by you at the time of such termination and/or cancellation.

Limited Warranty For The Muse Headband
Dead on Arrival Products.
If you are the original purchaser of a Muse headband from Interaxon or an authorised Interaxon retailer and the Muse headband is Dead on Arrival (namely, when you first attempted to use the product after opening the box, it demonstrated hardware failure, preventing even basic operability), the Muse headband may be returned by you to us within thirty (30) days of your original purchase.
If we verify that you were the original purchaser of the product and the product was Dead on Arrival, we will offer you the following options at our expense:
(a) ship you a replacement product; or
(b) service the product, in which case you will not have the right of replacement.
To be eligible to return any Dead on Arrival product to us, you must follow the warranty claim process set out below.
Manufacturer Defects.
Your Muse headband is warranted by Interaxon Inc. and/or its affiliates (“
Interaxon
”) to be free of defects in materials or workmanship, under normal use, for a period of one (1) year from the date of your original purchase of the new Muse headband
except to the extent a longer period is required by applicable law (the “
Warranty Period
”). This limited warranty excludes damage resulting from: (i) improper care or handling (including, without limitation, user abuse or proximity to moisture or heat), (ii) accidents, (iii) modification, (iv) unauthorized repairs, (v) use of the Muse headband with accessories, products, services or software applications not expressly approved or provided by Interaxon, (vi) use of the Muse headband in a manner contrary to, or not in accordance with, the documentation, guidelines or instructions provided by Interaxon or (vi) other causes which are not defects in materials or workmanship of the Muse headband.
This warranty does not cover: (a) used or refurbished products; (b) products provided as a “sample”, “AS IS” or “complimentary”; (c) any third party products Interaxon sells; or (d) any accessories for the Muse headband.
The warranty only extends to new Muse headbands purchased by you from Interaxon or an authorised Interaxon retailer.
If there is a covered defect with the Muse headband, Interaxon will, at its discretion, repair (with new or refurbished parts) or replace (with new or refurbished product) your Muse headband free of charge, or will issue you with a refund. The Warranty Period for the repaired or replaced Muse headband will expire upon the expiration of the original Warranty Period (except to the extent Interaxon is expressly required by law to provide you a longer Warranty Period for the repaired or replaced Muse headband).
This warranty is a hardware only warranty that is limited to the Muse headband and does not cover any software made available, shipped, pre-loaded, or distributed by Interaxon or any third party, even if the software is packaged or sold with the product, or available for the product at a later time.
Software license agreements apply to your use of software associated with the Muse headband. The software license for Interaxon proprietary software to be used with the Muse headband is described in the applicable Interaxon end user license agreement.
To be eligible to return any defective
Muse headband
to us, you must follow the warranty claim process set out below.
Warranty Claim Process.
To be eligible to return any
Muse headband
to us, you must have a Dead on Arrival product or a
Muse headband
with a manufacturer’s defect and you must:
(1) prior to shipping the Muse headband to us, contact us through
http://choosemuse.com/pages/contact
and obtain a Return Material Authorisation (RMA) number, shipping address and other instructions.
The RMA number must be included with your Muse headband return
(2) provide us valid proof of your original purchase
(3) package the Muse headband in the original, unmarked packaging together with all accessories, manuals, and documentation (unless otherwise requested by Interaxon)
(4) include a description of the reason for the Muse headband return.
If we determine that there was no valid reason for returning the
Muse headband
to us (i.e. it was not Dead on Arrival or did not have a manufacturer’s defect), we may, at our discretion, refuse to accept the
Muse headband
or return the
Muse headband
to you and charge you a USD$200 handling fee.
Limitation of Liability.
The
Muse headband
is provided “AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS”, and Interaxon hereby disclaims all other warranties, conditions and the provision of or failure to provide support or other services, information, software, and related content through the
Muse headband
or otherwise arising out of the use of the
Muse headband
. This limited warranty is in place of all other express and implied warranties, conditions, representations, or guarantees of any kind (including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality and/or fitness for a particular purpose) which are all hereby excluded and shall have no effect. In no event shall Interaxon or anyone acting on behalf of or with Interaxon (including, without limitation, in relation to the manufacture, supply, distribution, sale, repair or return of the product) be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss or damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of use of the products or functionality, business interruption, loss or corruption of information (including data), or other pecuniary loss)
arising out of the use or inability to use the
Muse headband
even if Interaxon or anyone acting on behalf of Interaxon has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
This limitation is intended to apply and does apply without regard to whether such damages are claimed, asserted or brought in an action or claim in tort, contract, on the warranty, or under any other legal theory. The liability of Interaxon (and any one acting on behalf of or with Interaxon) to you for loss or damage arising under this warranty shall not exceed in aggregate the net purchase price you paid for the product or the cost of replacing the
Muse headband
, whichever is greater.
The foregoing shall not in any way restrict any liability in relation to death or bodily injury or statutory liability for intentional and gross negligent acts or omissions.
No other person or company is authorized to change this warranty.
Some states and countries do not allow limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, or exclusion of all or certain types of damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other additional statutory rights, which vary from state to state or within a particular country. The foregoing is without prejudice to other legal rights that may arise under applicable mandatory legislation. This warranty extends only to new
Muse headband
purchased by you from Interaxon or an authorized Interaxon retailer.

Under your Consumer Rights, you are entitled to: (a) a replacement or refund for Muse headband with a major failure, and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage; and (b) have the Muse headband repaired or replaced if the Muse headband fails to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure; and (c) such remedies are in addition to your rights under this limited warranty.
If you are a consumer under the Australian Consumer Law, you may return a defective Muse headband to: (a) the authorized Interaxon retailer from whom you purchased the Muse headband; or (b) Interaxon directly by contacting Interaxon pursuant to the warranty claims process set out above, or by phoning +1 416 598 8989.

When you visit our websites or apps, we may allow some third parties to (such as advertising networks and data analytics companies) collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and apps (such as websites

To the extent any personal data is submitted by you or we otherwise collect, such personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy (

We are not responsible for any use or disclosure of your information by the Professional or another third party.
