Tebi Privacy Policy
Tebi is an app released in the App Store under Francesco Romeo's personal account.
I highly value your privacy and have designed our app with this principle in mind.
Tebi allows you to edit images and store them on your device. All image processing happens directly on your device, and no data or images are stored on our servers.
Tebi stores all edited images locally on your device. We do not use iCloud or any other cloud storage service to sync or store your data.
No personally identifiable information is collected or transmitted to external locations when using Tebi.
We may collect non-personally identifiable information such as device type and operating system version. This is used in aggregate to help facilitate development decisions and improve the app.
Tebi does not integrate with any third-party services. All functionality is self-contained within the app.
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy in the app. You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how your data is handled when you use Tebi, please feel free to email me at
