Last updated on June 26, 2024
1. Introduction
Libro.fm is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of our Service. The Libro.fm Service includes (a) any internet sites operated by Libro.fm, including without limitation the Libro.fm website at
https://libro.fm/
, the Libro.fm Blog (
https://blog.libro.fm/
), and Bookstore Link (
https://www.bookstorelink.com/
) (collectively the “Site”); (b) software made available through or in connection with the Libro.fm Service including mobile applications or apps (the “Service Applications”); and (c) the sale of audiobooks, memberships, credit bundles, clothing and other merchandise (collectively the “Products”) through the Site and the Service Applications. Together, the Site, Service Applications and the sale of Products are collectively referred to as the “Service.” Libro.fm has established and implemented this Privacy Policy to help you make informed decisions when using the Libro.fm Service.
The Libro.fm
Terms of Use
and this Privacy Policy describe the terms and conditions applicable to your access and use of the Service.
Please note that different privacy terms may apply to you based on where you live. Make sure you read the jurisdiction specific privacy terms for your country of residence located at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. There are currently jurisdiction specific privacy terms for users in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand as set out in Sections 12, 13, 14, and 15.  The jurisdiction specific section might include additional information required under your local data ‎protection laws, and may render certain aspects of the general Privacy Policy to be inapplicable, or ‎amend them accordingly to ensure compliance with your local data protection and privacy laws. As such, please be ‎sure you review this Privacy Policy in its entirety.‎
By using or interacting with the Service, you are entering into a binding contract with Libro.fm and acknowledge the use of your information as explained in this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree with these terms, then please don’t use the Service.
2. Information we collect
This Privacy Policy relates to “personal data”, “personal information” or “data”, which are terms used by privacy ‎and personal data regulators used around the world to cover the same type of data or ‎information: that is, data or information that is information about you as an identifiable individual or that ‎can be linked to you as an identifiable individual.
Information We Collect Directly From You. The type of information that we collect from you depends on your interaction with our Site and Services.
You must create an account to purchase audiobooks or memberships from the Site. To create an account, you must provide your name, email address, country, postal code or zip code, and password. You can also choose to support a specific bookstore.  We also may collect additional optional information from you such as how you heard about us and other contact information.
If you become a member or make a purchase, you must provide your payment information, country, and zip code or postal code to our payment processor. For a purchase requiring shipment, we will collect your shipping address.
We will also collect information about your purchases, returns, gifts and recipients, statistics about your accomplishments as a listener and bookstore supporter, preferences such as language and genre and your email and club type when you sign up for book clubs.
If you refer a friend, we will collect the contact information you provide and may provide you with referral credits.
Through its Audiobook Listening Copy (“ALC”) program, Libro.fm provides promotional copies of audiobooks to influencers, press, educators, librarians, and owners and employees of bookstore partners. If you apply for, or participate in, one of these ALC programs, we will collect your name and contact information and information to determine your qualification for the ALC program, including associated organizations, and social media channels for influencers. If you participate in one of the ALC programs, you agree that Libro.fm may share your name, organization, email address, social media and internet profiles, and ALC download activity with publishers and others as part of our ALC Program. The publisher’s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
Libro.fm provides audiobooks to corporations and other organizations for distribution to employees and other recipients chosen by the organization. If you receive an audiobook from an organization, we may provide your name, email address and which book(s) you received to the organization in accordance with our agreement with the organization. The organization’s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
Information We Collect Automatically. We automatically collect the following information about your use of our Site or Services and your device through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your browser type and operating system; device information; web pages you view on our Site; links you click on our Site; your IP address; the length of time you visit our Site and or use our Services; and the referring URL or the webpage that led you to our Site. We will collect information about your purchases, quizzes, recommendations, preferences, playlists, and other activities on the Site and Services.
Cookies and Other Technologies
Like many websites, we employ "cookies" on the Site and Service to allow us to provide and improve your experience. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser. Each user is assigned a “cookie ID” from our Site domain in connection with the registration process. We use cookies, including your cookie ID, to store a user's log-in identity when you re-access the Site; to monitor irregular account behavior and to prevent fraud; and to generate and compile aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users navigate our Site and Service. You may refuse the use of certain cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser or device; however, if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site and Service.
Log Information
We also keep track of your interaction with the Site, Service and any other users. Specifically, our servers automatically record information that your browser (or our Service) sends whenever you interact with the Service. This information includes your Internet Protocol address (IP address), your cookie ID, your browser type and version, mobile operating system, mobile device type, app version, which aspects of Service you use and when and how long you use them, and how you otherwise access the Libro.fm Service.
Do-Not-Track
Currently, our Site and Services do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
Third-Party Analytics
Our Site and Services may use services operated by third parties, such as Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Sites and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and you can opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt out browser add-on, available at  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Social Plugins
We use Instagram, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, YouTube, and Vimeo social plugins on our Site. When you view a web page that contains a plugin, your browser will create a direct link to the third parties’ servers. If you are logged into your social media account, the social media platform will record the visit to your social media account. Please visit the social media platform’s privacy policy for more information.
Third-Party Ad Networks
We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
Consumer Choice Page
for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA
Consumer Choice Page
will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA site, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info.
3. How we use your information
We may use the information we collect, including your personal information, to:
provide, personalize, and improve your experience with the Site, Services and Products, for example by providing customized or localized content such as bookstore finder, recommended books, event notices, or advertising;
ensure technical functioning of the Site and Service;
provide customer support, including facilitating returns and refunds;
develop new products, services and recommendations, and analyze your use of the Site, Services, and Products including your interaction with applications, advertising, Products and Services;

enforce this Privacy Policy and the Libro.fm Terms of Use, including to protect the rights, property or safety of us, users or any other person and the copyright-protected content; and
as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy or through our notice to you.
4. Your choices
To modify your email marketing preferences, please go to
https://libro.fm/user
and select “Edit account info” or or opt out using the unsubscribe link in the email. Even if you opt out of marketing emails, we may still email you regarding your transactions. Through your device and browser settings, you can change your cookie and advertising choices. When you login, you can edit your account information, choose to delete your account, manage your public wish list information, and change your bookstore.
5. Sharing of information with third parties
We may share your information in the following ways:
With Service Providers and Affiliates
We use third parties to manage portions of the Service, facilitate our business (e.g., by hosting our servers or providing payment processing services to us), manage communications with you, or otherwise provide services to us in connection with the Service. Your personal information may be transmitted to and from, and maintained and processed, by our affiliates and other third parties who provide services on our behalf in the U.S. or other jurisdictions.
With Bookstore Partners and Other Third Parties
As part of the Service, we allow you to support bookstore partners by designating a bookstore partner to receive a share of the profits from your purchases of audiobooks and memberships. When you have selected a bookstore partner, Libro.fm will share with that bookstore partner your name, email address, and purchases of audiobooks and memberships.  As stated above, we also share information with publishers, authors, employers and others through our ALC and employee programs.
You can refer friends and create wish lists and share these with your friends and family.
When you receive an audiobook or membership as a gift or from an organization, we may provide confirmation that you received the audiobook or membership to the person or organization that gave it to you, along with identifying information about you.
We may also share your information with advertising networks, advertisers and analytics providers for the purposes of interest-based advertising.
We will share personal information we collect from you if we believe it is reasonably necessary to make the Libro.fm Service available to you, legally required, or otherwise permitted by you.
In addition to the above, we may also share your information with third parties: to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets; to respond to legal process; to inform business partners about use of the Libro.fm Service and products and services made available through the Libro.fm Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not reveal your identity; and if you expressly opt in to such sharing or when we otherwise notify you.
6. Additional information about third parties
This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site or Service, such as social networks and advertising networks. We are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.
7. Security
We are committed to protecting our users’ information. Your password protects your user account, so you should use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and sign off after having used the Service. While we take reasonable data protection precautions, no security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any time.
8. Children's privacy
The Libro.fm Service is intended for users age 18 or older.
Through our kids’ book club and other marketing, we offer recommendations for children’s books for the use of parents and guardians only. We do not knowingly collect or maintain any personal information from anyone under the age of 13 nor is any part of our Site or Service directed to children under the age of 13. We will remove and/or delete any personal information we believe was submitted by any child under the age of 13.
9. Special note to users outside of the United States
The Site and Service is hosted in the United States. If you are a user accessing the Site or Service from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Libro.fm Service, which is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, our Terms and our payment terms, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you hereby acknowledge that the recipients of the information may not be required to protect the ‎information in a way that, overall, provides comparable safeguards to those in your local data ‎protection law, and you hereby‎ consent to the transfer of such information outside of the country where you are located. For the avoidance of doubt, any information we or you may share with any social network may be transmitted to and stored by such parties on servers in the United States.

12.  Jurisdiction Specific Supplementary Privacy Terms - Canada
The following additional provisions apply only to individuals who reside in Canada.‎
CASL Policy.
We are committed to compliance with Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”).  Any electronic ‎‎communication we send to outside parties is protected by a range of business procedures, processes ‎‎and policies to ensure that such communication is done in compliance with CASL. In our electronic communications with outside parties, we comply with the rules established by CASL and enforced by ‎‎various Canadian authorities including the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications ‎‎Commission. CASL regulates, and our policies generally apply to, each commercial electronic message ‎‎‎(a “CEM”) that we send. A CEM is an electronic message sent to an electronic address that, among its ‎‎purposes, encourages participation in a commercial activity.‎
In addition to adopting and updating this CASL Policy, we undertake various transparency initiatives to ‎ensure ‎we comply with CASL, which include:‎
Consent— we do not send you CEMs without your consent. This consent typically must be ‎‎“express” ‎‎(expressly acknowledged by you), but in certain circumstances can be “implied” or ‎specifically ‎exempt from consent requirements.  We modified or adopted our sign-up, ‎registration and ‎consent forms in order to ensure that your consent is meaningful (i.e. ‎informed and freely given) ‎as per CASL.  When we collect your electronic contact personal information, ‎you will know the ‎exact purposes behind the collection.‎
Content— we adopted processes to ensure that our CEMs contain the following requirements ‎‎prescribed under CASL, which will usually be in the footer of the CEM. We will:‎
Identify ourselves as the party sending the CEM, and whether we are sending the message ‎‎on our own behalf or on behalf of someone else;‎
Provide you with our contact personal information; and‎
Set out a clear, working unsubscribe mechanism or preference centre that is easy to use, ‎‎automatic, and at no cost to you (other than your own cost of connecting to the ‎Internet).‎
Clarity— we ensured that each aspect of a CEM, including its header, content, or any links or URLs ‎‎in the CEM) conveys the appropriate personal information, whether viewed individually or taken ‎as a ‎whole, so that you always know what you are clicking on.‎
If you receive a CEM from us but believe that you should not have or no longer wish to receive CEMs, ‎we ‎will aim to respect your preferences in a timely manner once you update them through our ‎unsubscribe ‎mechanism. CASL requires us to process unsubscribe requests within 10 business days.  If ‎you have any ‎questions or concerns about our unsubscribe options, you may contact us at the address ‎indicated in ‎Section 11 of the Privacy Policy above.‎
13.  Jurisdiction Specific Supplementary Privacy Terms - United Kingdom

In these cases we will look after your information at ‎all times in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights and you have a right to ‎object to such processing as explained in the section titled “Your Privacy Rights” below; or
You have consented to the processing (e.g., to provide you with direct communication and ‎marketing). ‎

To this end:‎
we ensure transfers within our group will be covered by an agreement entered into by our ‎members (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that ‎personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is ‎transferred within our group;‎
where we transfer your personal information to third parties who help provide the Service, we ‎rely on authorised transfer mechanisms and where necessary, we obtain contractual ‎commitments from them to protect your personal information; or
