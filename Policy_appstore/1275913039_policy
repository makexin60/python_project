Sharing Information with Third Parties

In order to most effectively serve you, we use services from established third party payment providers (such as with PLAID TECHNOLOGIES INC, Lithic Inc, Patriot Bank, N.A) to handle credit card transactions and order fulfillment. These companies receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.
