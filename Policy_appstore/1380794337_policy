					information about them, as well as rights to know/access, delete, and
					limit disclosure of personal information. You have the right to be
					free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights.
					To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to
					the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are
					described below.

						of Personal Information Collected

					categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for
					which we use personal information. The following table summarizes the
					categories of personal information we collect, the categories of

Entities to whom we
					disclose information for business purposes are
service providers
,
					which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our
					behalf. We restrict service providers from using personal information
					for any purpose that is not related to our engagement.
Entities to whom we “sell” information are
third parties
. Under the CCPA, a business “sells” personal
					information when it discloses personal information to a company for
					monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party
					either because we disclose personal information to the company for
					something other than an enumerated business purpose under California
					law, or because its contract does not restrict it from using personal
					information for purposes unrelated to the service it provides to us.
Your rights under
						the CCPA
Opt out of sale of personal information
: You have the
							right to opt out of our sale of your personal information to third
							parties. To exercise this right, please visit our Do Not Sell My
							Personal Information webpage or contact us. Please be aware that
							your right to opt out does not apply to our disclosure of personal
							information to service providers.
Know and request access to and deletion of personal
								information
: You have the right to request access to personal
							information collected about you and information regarding the source
							of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it,
							and the third parties and service providers with to whom we sell or
							disclose it. You also have the right to request in certain
							circumstances that we delete personal information that we have
							collected directly from you. Please contact us to exercise these
							rights.
Nevada
Residents of the State of Nevada have the right to
					opt out of the sale of certain pieces of their information to third
					parties. Currently, we do not engage in such sales. If you are a
					Nevada resident and would like more information about our data
					sharing practices, please contact us.

Making a request to exercise your rights
Submitting requests

					exercise your rights making a request using the contact information
					above.
If you are a California resident, you may
					authorize another individual or a business registered with the
					California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make

					have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a
					more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that
					to you in our response.
Verification
: We
					must verify your identity before responding to your request. We
					verify your identity by asking you to provide personal identifiers
					that we can match against information we may have collected from you
					previously. We may need to follow up with you to request more
					information to verify identity.

					connection with verifying or responding to your request for any
					purpose other than responding to your request.

Your California Privacy
					Rights; “Shine the Light” Law

					free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding
					our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information
					to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the
					preceding calendar year. We do not share your personal information
					with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing
					purposes.
California Consumer
					Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)
					provides California residents with rights to receive certain
					disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of
					information about them, as well as rights to know/access, delete, and
					limit disclosure of personal information. You have the right to be
					free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights.
					To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to
					the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are
					described below.
Notice at Collection Regarding the Categories
						of Personal Information Collected
You have the right to receive notice of the
					categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for
					which we use personal information. The following table summarizes the
					categories of personal information we collect, the categories of
					sources of that information, and whether we disclose or sell that
					information to service providers or third parties, respectively. The
					categories we use to describe personal information are those

Entities to whom we
					disclose information for business purposes are
service providers
,
					which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our
					behalf. We restrict service providers from using personal information
					for any purpose that is not related to our engagement.
Entities to whom we “sell” information are
third parties
. Under the CCPA, a business “sells” personal
					information when it discloses personal information to a company for
					monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party
					either because we disclose personal information to the company for
					something other than an enumerated business purpose under California
					law, or because its contract does not restrict it from using personal
					information for purposes unrelated to the service it provides to us.
Your rights under
						the CCPA
Opt out of sale of personal information
: You have the
							right to opt out of our sale of your personal information to third
							parties. To exercise this right, please visit our Do Not Sell My
							Personal Information webpage or contact us. Please be aware that
							your right to opt out does not apply to our disclosure of personal
							information to service providers.
Know and request access to and deletion of personal
								information
: You have the right to request access to personal
							information collected about you and information regarding the source
							of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it,
							and the third parties and service providers with to whom we sell or
							disclose it. You also have the right to request in certain
							circumstances that we delete personal information that we have
							collected directly from you. Please contact us to exercise these
							rights.
Nevada
Residents of the State of Nevada have the right to
					opt out of the sale of certain pieces of their information to third
					parties. Currently, we do not engage in such sales. If you are a
					Nevada resident and would like more information about our data

Making a request to exercise your rights
Submitting requests
: You may request to
					exercise your rights making a request using the contact information
					above.
If you are a California resident, you may
					authorize another individual or a business registered with the
					California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make
					requests on your behalf.
We may have a reason under the law why we do not
					have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a
					more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that
					to you in our response.
Verification
: We
					must verify your identity before responding to your request. We
					verify your identity by asking you to provide personal identifiers
					that we can match against information we may have collected from you
					previously. We may need to follow up with you to request more
					information to verify identity.
We will not use personal information we collect in
					connection with verifying or responding to your request for any
					purpose other than responding to your request.
