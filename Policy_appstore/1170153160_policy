​
This Policy aims to give you information on how we collect and process your personal data through your use of this mobile application (" App") and the game available on it, including any data you may provide when using our App.
PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
Personal data means any information about a person that can identify him or her. We collect or receive information in two ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account on our App, or (2) we collect information automatically through tracking technologies that monitor your use of our App. Each of these methods is described in more detail below.
Information you voluntarily provide
You might provide information to us in connection with your use of our App, such as when creating an account or when you contact us for technical support or any other reason.
The information you provide to us may include your name, your display name and your email address(es). Sometimes we ask for your age and your gender. You may also choose to provide us with the name(s) of the loved one(s) you have lost and information about how he or she died.
Internet protocol addresses (which are unique numbers that link to your online activity) are considered "personal data" in the United Kingdom and will be treated in accordance with this Policy.
​
If you store information locally on your device, we will not have access to your information (other than usage data and statistics about how you use our App, as described in the next section below).
Information we collect when you use our App
When using our App, we will collect certain information automatically through tracking technologies. This information will include:
usage data and statistics about how you use our App, such as the types of content you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, the time, frequency and duration of your activities and any emotions you record as you play;
crash reports, which may be automatically generated when our App crashes;
information to facilitate a safer and more personalized experience, including your display name or other user identification, your saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and to prevent against identity theft; and
the location of your device, to the extent you may this available to us.
We typically aggregate the data that we collect automatically and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals. However, if any of this information does identify you as an individual, we will treat that information as personal data.
