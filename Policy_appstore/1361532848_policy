Whenever you use our website, our platform or our apps, we process connection data that is automatically transmitted to enable you to visit the website or use the app. This connection data includes meta and communication data, website accesses, and other data generated via a website or when using an app such as IP address, IP location, type and version of the terminal device used, information on the mobile network used, time zone settings, operating system and platform.
The data processing of this connection data is absolutely necessary to enable the visit of the website, the platform or the use of the app, to ensure the permanent integrity, confidentiality and availability of our systems, for general administrative maintenance of our systems and for support, billing and fraud prevention purposes. The connection data is temporarily stored in internal log files for the purposes described above and the content is limited to what is necessary.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, insofar as the page view occurs in the course of the initiation or execution of a contract, and otherwise Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR due to our legitimate interest in enabling website access and app use, in the permanent integrity, confidentiality and availability of our systems, in the administration of our systems and in support, billing and fraud prevention.

If you have created a Verimi account, you can use our services via our website or our app. To create a Verimi account with us and use the various Verimi services, you must register with Verimi and enter into a user agreement with Verimi (see our
terms of use
). In this section we inform you about the personal data we process when you use our services.
The legal basis for the processing of your data by Verimi is the fulfilment of the existing contract of use between you and us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR), unless another legal basis is explicitly mentioned below.
For some services of Verimi (e.g. COVID Pass) you can also provide special categories of personal data according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR, in particular health data. The legal basis for the processing of this data is your explicit consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR).
We also process your data internally in anonymised form for statistical purposes in order to be able to draw conclusions about user behaviour and performance.
The legal basis for processing this data is our legitimate interest in improving our services and evaluating partner performance (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
In addition, we conduct satisfaction surveys or ask for your feedback on our services and inform you about our offers, in each case with your prior consent.

4.1 Identification/Ident
:
When you use the “Identify” service, Verimi provides several options to verify your identity. For the purpose of verifying your identity, the data processing depends on (1) the chosen identification method (see sections 4.2 to 4.7) and (2) the chosen document.
For identity cards, passports and electronic residence titles, we process as far as available:
Family name and maiden name
First name(s)
PhD
Order name, artist name
Day and place of birth
Gender
Size
Eye colour
Residence/address
Nationality
Signature
Facial image

First name(s)
Day and place of birth
Signature
Facial image
Date of issue
Expiry date
Exhibition Authority
Driving licence number
Driving licence classes
Date of issue
Period of validity of driving licence categories issued for a limited period of time
Restrictions and additional information (including conditions) in coded form
Registrations of other Member States after change of residence abroad.
You can also use the “ID” service to simplify identification with partners. If you use services with partners that require certain identifications (e.g. driving licence with a car sharing provider), you can use your verified documents stored in your Verimi account for this purpose. When you connect your Verimi account to such a partner, we share the relevant information and documents with the relevant partner to fulfil the contract.
4.2 Verimi Bank Ident:
Verimi Bank-Ident verifies your identity on the basis of your bank account. Depending on the requirements, there are different use cases in which the data is processed accordingly. The account balance, overdraft facility, account movements and other information relating to creditworthiness are not recorded at any time.
Verimi Bank-Ident (AML):
If you use the Verimi Bank-Ident (AML) identification method, we will carry out an identity check using a qualified electronic signature (QES) and a small-value transfer (reference transfer). For this purpose, we first collect your name, title, place of birth, date of birth, nationality, address, e-mail address and mobile phone number as part of the identification process. You then initiate a reference transfer using the payment initiation service (see also section 4.10.4). We will transmit your name and BIC for this purpose. In addition to the transaction data, we collect the account holder’s name, IBAN and BIC via the reference transfer. If we are unable to collect the account holder’s name via the payment initiation service, we will then collect the account holder’s name using the account information service (see also section 4.10.5).
The QES is created on the basis of the processing carried out to date. For this purpose, we transmit your name, your nationality, your mobile phone number and the document to be signed to the qualified trust service provider. By entering an SMS code sent to you, you authorise the QES.
Bank-Ident (QES):
If you use Bank-Ident (QES), your identity will be verified using your personal data and the login to your online banking.
To verify your bank details, we process the account data in accordance with your order. The following data is collected: Account holder, account name, IBAN, BIC, account number, sort code. Other data, e.g. any necessary second factor, e.g. TAN, which you use to log in to your bank account. This data is only forwarded to your bank and is not stored by Verimi.
In the event of a successful identity check, it is possible to digitally sign documents with legal validity using a qualified electronic signature, depending on the integration of the service.
Verimi Bank-Ident Light:
If you use Bank-Ident Light, your identity will be checked using your personal data and the login to your online banking.
To verify your bank details, we process the account data in accordance with your order. The following data is collected: Account holder, account name, IBAN, BIC, account number, sort code. Other data, e.g. any necessary second factor, e.g. TAN, which you use to log in to your bank account. This data is only forwarded to your bank and is not stored by Verimi.
As part of the Verimi Bank-Ident (AML), Bank-Ident (QES) and Verimi Bank-Ident Light procedures, Verimi transmits the personal data collected (name, title, address, date of birth and, only in the case of Verimi Bank-Ident (AML) and Bank-Ident (QES), IBAN and account holder name) to SCHUFA Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65201 Wiesbaden, Germany. The legal basis for these transfers is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Transfers on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR may only take place if this is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of Verimi or third parties and does not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data. Verimi’s legitimate interest in this case is the verification of the data collected for identification purposes. Verimi can recognise whether a person is stored in SCHUFA’s database under the data provided on the basis of the match rates transmitted by SCHUFA and, if necessary, on the basis of a reference to an ID-based legitimation check carried out in the past at SCHUFA or another business partner. SCHUFA processes the data received and may also use it for the purpose of profiling (scoring) in order to provide its contractual partners in the European Economic Area and Switzerland and, if applicable, other third countries (insofar as an adequacy decision of the European Commission exists for these) with information, among other things, to assess the creditworthiness of natural persons. Further information on SCHUFA’s activities can be found in the
SCHUFA information pursuant to Art. 14 GDPR.
Verimi bank account verification (account information service)
:
By using the Verimi bank account verification Verimi verifies your identity based on your login to your online banking. To verify your bank details, we process the account data in accordance with your order. The following data is collected: Account holder, account name, IBAN, BIC, account number, sort code. Other data, e.g. any necessary second factor, e.g. TAN, which you use to log in to your bank account, is only forwarded to your bank and is not stored by Verimi. To ensure security during transmission of this bank-login-data to your bank, the bank-login-data is encrypted in accordance with Verimi standards (see section 5) and forwarded to your bank. Verimi does not store your account data once it is forwarded to your bank.
The legal basis for the processing of your data in all use cases is the fulfilment of the user contract with you, see Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. In the case of Verimi Bank-Ident (AML), your data is also processed for the fulfilment of legal identification obligations and thus on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.
4.3
eID-Ident:
If you choose the eID identification method (online ID card function of the ID card), we will carry out an identity check using the eID function of your ID card, EU citizen card or residence permit. For this purpose, 2-factor authentication (2FA) is activated, see also section 7.2. Identification via eID is only possible via a terminal device using an NFC-enabled smartphone. This procedure is only suitable for documents with the eID function switched on.
4.4
Video-Ident:
If you opt for the Video-Ident identification method, we will carry out an identity check by means of video telephony. For this purpose, 2-factor authentication (2FA) is activated, see also section 7.2. Moreover, identification via video is only possible via an end device with a supported camera and microphone; the corresponding authorisations must be granted for Video-Ident. The Video-Ident procedure can be used for identity cards, passports, electronic residence titles and driving licences.
4.5
Photo-Ident:
If you choose the Photo-Ident identification method, we will carry out an identity check using automated algorithms. For identification via Photo-Ident, an end device with a camera and microphone is also required, and the corresponding authorisations must be granted for Photo-Ident. In addition, photo identification via a mobile device requires the receipt of text messages and/or the reading of QR codes. The photo ID procedure can be used for identity cards, passports, electronic residence titles and driving licences.
4.6 Local-Ident:
If you choose the Local-Ident identification method (identification at a local partner), we will carry out an identity check using our own application by an employee or that of a local partner company. In addition, Local-Ident requires a terminal device to receive SMS or the use of the Verimi app on the user’s terminal device. Local-Ident can be used for identity cards, passports and electronic residence titles as well as for driving licences.
4.7 Company data:
Should you opt for the identification method Company Account, we will carry out an identification of your company. In this process, the person authorised for the company is identified (see sections 4.2 to 4.6) and activated as the holder of the company account. Subsequently, previously identified employees of the company are verified by the authorised person after their consent and also activated for the company account. For this purpose, we process as far as available:
General company data
E-mail address and role of staff
4.8 Authentication/Access:
The “Authentication” service allows you to log in or authenticate directly with our partners using your Verimi account.
We only process your Verimi authentication means and account information (e.g. username and password, e-mail link, Verimi PIN or biometric methods) that are required for authentication with the partner. Which personal data is required at the partner depends on the respective partner, this can be e.g. e-mail addresses, user names or also IBAN (e.g. for logging in to online banking).
4.9
Sign:
You can only use the “Sign” service if you have previously identified yourself, e.g. with an identity document (see section 4.1 et seq).
Using the identification data set (first name and surname, place of birth, date of birth, nationality and residential address) from the ID document, a personal signature certificate is created and securely stored with the help of our trust service provider. The signature certificate enables you to electronically sign electronic documents. After uploading the document to be signed, you confirm your intention to sign via the stored second factor (e.g. via SMS or the Verimi app). The signed document is made available to you and your contract partner (or only to you within the scope of the self-service).
4.10 Verimi Pay:
When you use the Verimi Pay service, we process your personal data as described in this section.
4.10.1
Implementation of the payment function:
For the purpose of enabling and utilizing the Verimi Pay function, you give us a direct debit mandate for your account to collect payments. Therefore, we require information on your bank details and your title, first and last name, pseudonym, date of birth, e-mail address, home address and any delivery address you may have provided. When using Verimi Pay, we also process your preferred security features required to authorise the transaction. In addition, we collect and store payment and transaction data relating to the transactions you initiate. We collect this for the purpose of communicating this to the credit institution we have commissioned to manage the trust account for payments.
Furthermore, we may transmit your title, name, date of birth, e-mail address and a delivery address to the application partner at your instruction so that the application partner can carry out the transaction (e.g. purchase of goods or services) on which the payment is based. Your bank details, however, will not be transmitted to the application partner.
The legal basis for the processing of this data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, as the processing is necessary for the use of Verimi Pay within the framework of the existing usage contract between you and us.
In the event of late payment, we also use this data for our receivables management. We store this data until one month after the last final payment on the basis of our legitimate interest in debtor management (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
4.10.2
Credit check
:
If you wish to activate Verimi Pay or request a higher usage limit, we will carry out a credit check. For this purpose we transfer your personal data (first and last name, title, gender, date of birth and residential address) to SCHUFA Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65201 Wiesbaden and in return we receive personal data from SCHUFA regarding your creditworthiness (score points and score group). If, in the event of a breach of contract on your part, a claim is enforced, we may report your personal data to SCHUFA (title, first and last name, home address, amount, date, bank details). The legal basis for this transfer is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR and § 31 Para. 2 Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG).
The SCHUFA processes the data received and also uses it for the purpose of profiling (scoring) in order to provide its contractual partners in the European Economic Area and in Switzerland and, if applicable, other third countries (insofar as there is an adequacy decision on these by the European Commission) with information on, among other things, the assessment of the creditworthiness of natural persons. Further information on SCHUFA’s activities can be found in the
SCHUFA information pursuant to Art. 14 GDPR
.
The admission to Verimi Pay by means of a credit check and the granting of higher usage limits constitute automated decisions in individual cases in accordance with Art. 22 GDPR. The automated decision-making is necessary in order to fulfil our contractual services to you. If the prognosis value obtained for your creditworthiness is below a predefined limit, Verimi Pay cannot be used by you or can only be used with a limited usage limit, without this being dependent on a non-automated decision. You have the right to contact us to explain your position and to request a change of the decision. For this purpose, please contact us at the above address.
4.10.3 Verification of bank details:
In order to be able to use Verimi Pay you have to deposit an online bank account in your Verimi account from which the payments can be debited. The bank account can only be successfully deposited if you successfully log into your bank account using the account information service (section 4.10.5). Furthermore, we match the account holder name collected from the bank account with the name from your Verimi account. This serves the purpose of fraud prevention and, if you have not yet deposited another verified identity, the fulfilment of identification obligations under money laundering law.
The legal basis for this processing is the fulfilment of legal processing obligations for the prevention of data misuse and criminal offences, Art 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, in conjunction with § 59 para. 1 Gesetz über die Beaufsichtigung von Zahlungsdiensten (ZAG).
4.10.4
Payment Trigger Service:
If you use the payment initiation service (online transfer function) of Verimi, we process the transaction data (IBAN, BIC, recipient, recipient account, transfer purpose, amount as well as confirmation of the transaction). The transaction data may also be transmitted to the recipient of the transfer. Furthermore, we collect the data you use to login to your bank account and to trigger the payment (using a second factor, e.g. TAN), but this data is only forwarded to your credit institution and is not stored at Verimi.
The legal basis for this processing is the fulfilment of the usage contract with you, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
4.10.5 Account Information Service:
If you use Verimi’s account information service (e.g. for the verification of bank details), we process the account data according to your order. For example we collect your IBAN and your name in order to be able to allocate the account details provided to you. Furthermore, we collect the data (including any necessary second factor, e.g. TAN) that you use to log in to your bank account. However, this data will only be forwarded to your bank and will not be stored at Verimi.
The legal basis for processing your data for the account information service is the fulfilment of the usage contract with you, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

4.12
Self-Service
:
As part of the Self Service, we offer you the possibility to view documents and data that you have uploaded to your Verimi account (e.g. ID data, ID documents, driving licence, COVID Pass, IBAN, tax number, etc.).
Furthermore, you can view your past activities (transactions, payments, logins to Verimi) and the devices and sessions used.
You can also sign PDF documents that you have uploaded yourself. The data processing involved corresponds to that described in section 4.3 “Signing”.
5.	Encryption
All data in your Verimi account (ID wallet) is encrypted and protected from access
The data (such as identity documents, driving licence, bank data such as IBAN, further details such as mobile number, e-mail address, etc.) are encrypted with user-specific keys and stored in a tamper-proof manner together with the Verimi ID generated by Verimi. For this purpose, individual keys are generated for all users.Data outside the ID Wallet (such as connection data, identity attributes and transaction data) is secured against unauthorized access with a Verimi key.
6.	Data processing due to legal requirements
In certain constellations, we process personal data because we are legally obliged to do so. In these cases, the processing is carried out exclusively insofar as this is necessary to comply with the corresponding legal obligations, the legal basis of the data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c GDPR, insofar as no other legal basis is expressly stated below.
Should you decide to store verified data collected through an identification process with a third party in your Verimi account for future use, data that we do not process on the basis of a legal obligation may be processed together to the same extent as data that is subject to legal processing obligations. This applies in particular to personal data that is technically inseparable from the document files that must be kept by law.
The legal basis for the processing of this data is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). This consists of the user-friendly provision of our services as well as enabling the storage of the above-mentioned verified data for the purpose of repeated usability by you.
Furthermore, Verimi is legally entitled and obliged to process identity documents according to ZAG.
In particular, Verimi is legally obliged to process your personal data in the following cases:

We are legally obliged to keep this data for a period of five years, § 8 para. 4 p. 1 GwG.
6.2

The users’ data is usually processed by the social networks concerned for market research and advertising purposes. In this way, usage profiles can be created based on the interests of the users. For this purpose, cookies and other identifiers are stored on the computers of the data subjects. Based on these usage profiles, advertisements, for example, are then placed within the social networks but also on third-party websites.
As part of the operation of our online presences, it is possible that we may access information such as statistics on the use of our online presences provided by the social networks. These statistics are aggregated and may include, in particular, demographic information (e.g. age, gender, region, country) as well as data on interaction with our online presences (e.g. likes, subscription, sharing, viewing of images and videos) and the posts and content distributed via them. This may also provide information about the interests of users and which content and topics are particularly relevant to them. This information may also be used by us to adapt the design and our activities and content on the online presence and optimize it for our audience. Please see the list below for details and links to the social network data that we, as operators of the online presences, can access. The collection and use of these statistics are generally subject to joint responsibility. Where applicable, the relevant agreement is listed below.
The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in effective information and communication with users, and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, in order to stay in contact with and inform our customers, as well as to carry out pre-contractual measures with interested parties.
Where you have an account with the social network, it is possible that we may see your publicly available information and media when we access your profile. In addition, the social network may allow us to contact you. This may be, for example, via direct messages or via posted articles. The content communication via the social network and the processing of the content data is thereby subject to the responsibility of the social network as a messenger and platform service.
For the legal basis of the data processing carried out by the social networks under their own responsibility, please refer to the data protection information of the respective social network. The following links will also provide you with further information on the respective data processing and the options to object.
We would like to point out that data protection requests can be asserted most efficiently with the respective provider of the social network, as only these providers have access to the data and can take appropriate measures directly. You can also contact us with your request. In this case, we will process your request and forward it to the provider of the social network.

10.	 Recipients of data
You have the option to transfer all, or part of your data stored in your Verimi account to our Verimi partners for certain purposes. Such transfer of your data will only be carried out by Verimi at your request and with your express consent. After the transfer of your data to a Verimi partner, the processing of your data will take place under the responsibility of the Verimi partner. The Verimi partner is then the responsible party according to Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR.
The data we collect will only be passed on if there is a legal basis for this under data protection law in the specific case, in particular if:
you have given your express consent to this in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR,
the disclosure is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest worthy of protection in not having your data disclosed,
we are legally obliged to disclose data pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, in particular if this is necessary for legal prosecution or enforcement due to official requests, court decisions and legal proceedings, or
this is legally permissible and required in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR for the processing of contractual relationships with you or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures that take place at your request.
In order to be able to offer you all functions at Verimi, we also use selected service providers who process data on our behalf. We only pass on data to service providers carefully selected by us and instructed in writing within the framework of legally permissible order processing. These only receive the data that is necessary for the fulfilment of the order and process it exclusively on our instructions. This includes the following categories of commissioned processors: Identification service providers, software developers, hosters of servers, cloud storage and mails, technical service providers, service providers for mail dispatch and newsletter dispatch, ticket system providers, customer support, content management system providers, customer relationship management providers, as well as web analytics service.
Your visit to our homepage and on the start page of our Wallet is evaluated by collecting and analyzing various statistical data. This is done through our cookie-free web analytics service Matomo.
You may choose to prevent this website from aggregating and analyzing the actions you take here. Doing so will protect your privacy, but will also prevent the owner from learning from your actions and creating a better experience for you and other users.
You are not opted out. Uncheck this box to opt-out.
11.	 In principle, no data transfer outside the EU
Verimi processes your data on servers within the European Union. This also applies to service providers commissioned by us for data processing.
In rare individual cases, e.g., when using our support, your data may be transferred to so-called third countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area) or personal data may be processed there.
Where this is the case and the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR) for these countries, we have taken appropriate precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfers. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses of the European Union or binding internal data protection regulations.
Where this is not possible, we base the transfer of data on exceptions to Art. 49 GDPR, in particular your express consent or the necessity of the transfer for the performance of the contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
If a third country transfer is provided for and no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are in place, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g. intelligence services) may gain access to the transferred data in order to collect and analyse it, and that the enforceability of your data subject rights cannot be guaranteed. When obtaining your consent, you will also be informed of this.
12.	 Duration of data storage
We store your data for the duration of the existence of your Verimi account. As long as your Verimi account exists, the user contract between you and Verimi also exists. However, you can delete your Verimi account at any time and thereby terminate the contract between you and Verimi. This also applies to services that can be considered separately, such as COVID Pass and driving licence. We will then delete your data unless we are legally obliged to continue to store or retain it or we have a legitimate interest in continuing to store it, for example to defend ourselves against legal claims or to enforce our own legal claims. A storage obligation may arise, for example, from legal requirements for the use of the Verimi payment function “Verimi Pay” or from tax or commercial law regulations. Furthermore, we are legally obliged to store your identification data for 10 years if you have used our signature function. If the data is still required to process outstanding transactions, it will be deleted at the earliest after these transactions have been processed.
13.	 No automated decision making and profiling
The processing of your personal data by us is not related to automated decision making or profiling (unless explicitly stated otherwise, see e.g., clause 4.4. “Verimi Pay”).
14.	 Data security
All data stored by us, or any order processors are protected against unauthorised access, loss and modification using current security standards. For this purpose, extensive technical and organisational security precautions are applied with a standard that at least corresponds to the legal requirements.
15.	 Your rights
You have the following rights with respect to us regarding the data relating to you:
Right to information about your stored personal data, its origin and possible recipients and the purpose of the data processing (Art. 15 GDPR),
Right to rectification of inaccurate data (Art. 16  GDPR),
Right to erasure of processed personal data, unless processed to fulfill a legal obligation or public interest (Art.17 GDPR), or there are statutory retention periods (see point 12.)
Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR),
Right to withdraw your consent. We will then no longer continue the processing based on this consent for the future. The lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation is not affected by the revocation. (Art. 7 GDPR),
Right to data portability but only in instances where data is processed on the basis of consent or performance of a contract (Art. 20 GDPR),
Right to object within the framework of the legal requirements. Should the data processing by us be based on legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation. You may object to the processing of your data for direct marketing purposes at any time, even without giving reasons (Art. 21 GDPR).
You have the right to revoke your consent at any time. This means that we will no longer process the data based on this consent in the future. The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.
If we process your data on the basis of legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your data at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation. If it is a matter of objecting to the processing of data for direct marketing purposes, you have a general right of objection, which will also be implemented by us without giving reasons.
If you wish to exercise your right of revocation or objection, it is sufficient to send an informal message to the above contact details.
To exercise your rights, please send us an informal message (see 1. responsible body)
Right of appeal
If you are of the opinion that the processing of personal data concerning you by us is unlawful or that we are violating data protection law for other reasons, you can complain to the supervisory authority responsible for us:
Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
Alt-Moabit 59-61
10555 Berlin

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google
to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

Exporting, removing & deleting your information
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Inactive Account Manager
allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.
And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.

Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Profile
You have
choices
about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo,
city or area
, endorsements, and optional
verifications
of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include
sensitive information
on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.

Cookie Policy
, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.
Learn more
. You can
opt out

1.5 Your Device and Location
We receive data through cookies and similar technologies
When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.
1.6 Communications
If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that.
We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use
automated systems
to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or
Professional Community Policies
.
1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information
When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.
Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “
LinkedIn Page
” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.
1.8 Sites and Services of Others
We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account.
We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies.
1.9 Other
We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.
Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.
Affiliates
Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation.
2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your
settings
. We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles
here
and learn more about our approach to generative AI

about the inferences we may make, including as to
your age and gender
and how we use them.
2.1 Services
Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
Stay Connected
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their
settings
, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can
choose
whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have
choices
about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

2.2 Premium Services
Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include
TeamLink
and
LinkedIn Pages
(e.g., content analytics and followers).
2.3 Communications
We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication
preferences
at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.

communications
between you and others through our Services, including for example
invitations
,
InMail
,
groups
and
messages
between connections.
2.4 Advertising
We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
Learn more
about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g. like, comment, follow, share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others’ Services
You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention
We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data

If you choose to close your
LinkedIn
account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have
restricted
your account for breach of our
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache.
