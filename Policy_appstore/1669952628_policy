We are a mobile tech company focused on deep learning-based products. Our aim is to offer the most innovative avatar and thumbnail making tools on the internet.
By accessing or using MyMood Ai, you agree to these Terms of Use, which constitute a binding contract between you and the Company. If you don’t agree with these Terms, including the arbitration provision and class action waiver in Section 15, do not use MyMood Ai. Your continued use of MyMood Ai will imply your acceptance of these Terms.
If you’re using MyMood Ai on behalf of another person or entity, you confirm that you are authorized to accept these Terms on their behalf, and that the person or entity is responsible for any violations of these Terms.

The MyMood Ai app utilizes a Neural Network Model known as Stable Diffusion to create custom Magic Avatars for users. If you have any questions about the technology, check out the FAQ section.
Here’s how it works: The user uploads 10 to 20 photos and selects their gender (or opts for “Other” if preferred). This information is used to retrain a copy of the Stable Diffusion model to personalize the Avatars. The generated Avatars and retrained model copy are then deleted from our servers permanently. There are restrictions on how Avatars can be used (e.g. no nude photos, no photos of others without consent), which can be found in Section 6.
Please note, we do not use your personal data to train or create other AI products. While we make efforts to monitor the AI model settings, it is possible that you may come across content that you find inappropriate. If this occurs, please reach out to us at support@mymoodai.app and we will take prompt action to improve the algorithm. Lastly, we kindly request that you follow the rules for using MyMood Ai outlined in Section 6 of these Terms.
