All our products are shipped by First Class Royal Mail.  We aim to dispatch your order within 48 hours of receipt,
but in exceptional circumstances it may take up to 14 days.  If an item is out of stock we will inform you by email;
you will always have the option to cancel your order if you prefer not to wait.  If you order a software product online
we will normally send it as an email attachment or provide download instructions.

Should an item arrive damaged please return it to us (we will reimburse the cost of the return shipping).
We will either replace it immediately or refund your money.  If for any reason you are not completely
happy with your purchase, you may (within fourteen days of receipt, and at your own expense) return the
