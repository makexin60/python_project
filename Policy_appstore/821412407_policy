Spoilers policy
Spoiler — a plot element of an unaired episode. This means, we may start to post information as soon as the episode is officially released, but not a second earlier. All information (pictures, synopsis, actors) officially released by the BBC is counted as promotion and may be posted. Be careful with that.
"Do not be alarmed. This is the kindness."
