When addressing your request, you may be interacting with an Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) technology which may provide you with an output to help answer your request. The reliance on an AI will be clearly indicated in the chatbot and you will always have the possibility of choosing to interact with one of Mangopay agents instead.

4. Profiling and automated decision-making
To prevent fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, Mangopay uses profiling, which means we automatically process your Personal Data to assess certain aspects related to you. This includes technical information about your device, system preferences, and how you interact with our services.
In some cases, this automated processing may lead to decisions made without human involvement, such as temporarily blocking a payment, delaying a payout, or limiting access to your account if we detect suspicious activity.
These decisions are usually temporary and are not intended to have a significant impact on your legal rights or produce serious consequences for you. However, decisions to block a transaction can produce legal effects or similarly significantly affect you, depending on individual circumstances, but are necessary to ensure transaction security, and prevent fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, in accordance with Mangopay’s legal obligations. It’s a critical part of the services we provide to keep your payments secure.
The legal grounds for profiling are:
The performance and execution of our agreement with you
Mangopay’s legitimate interest in ensuring security and preventing fraud
If you are not satisfied with an automated decision or want more information, you can contact us at the email addresses specified in the “Country Specific Information” section to request a human intervention or to contest the decision.
