THE INFORMATION WE GATHER
Non-personally identifiable information – When visitors come to 41NBC.com, we collect and aggregate information using Google Analytics. Google Analytics gathers information including pages visited and the order in which they were visited. Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the website. Although such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us diagnose problems with our host server, administer the website, identify the most popular areas of the website, and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities.
All non-personal information we gather is used to build higher quality, more useful online services. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who show interest in a particular subject.

Personally identifiable information – In certain areas of the website, such as online contests, we may require that you provide personally identifiable information; this may include your name, company name, address, phone number and email address.

If and when we sponsor promotions or contests, or third parties sponsor promotions or contests in conjunction with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular promotion or contest. (Please ALWAYS read the rules of a contest before you enter!) Other than that your information will not be sold or turned-over to a third party without you being informed.
