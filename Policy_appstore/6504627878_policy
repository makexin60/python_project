In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our products and services as the “Service.” Please read on to learn more about our data handling practices.

Information we collect
When you install the Service on your device and register with
SHARE
, personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process for the Service (as requested from you during the download process) when you register with us. For registration through
SHARE
, you are required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, city location, gender, name, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service. You may also provide personally identifiable information, but that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook account, we may collect additional information you make available to us (see “Your User Profile”) below.
In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register with
SHARE
, you may will be asked to allow us access to your address book. If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personal information in your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to help you use the Service, for example, by synchronizing your
SHARE
contacts between different devices you may want to use with the Service. If you do not want
SHARE
to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings in the
SHARE
application at any time. However we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this information.
SHARE
may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information including country of residence and preferences. In addition,
SHARE
may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the Service and our websites, including matches, numbers of matches made by members, match durations, text messages... If you give us permission, we can collect your geolocation data via GPS. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.
SHARE
allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots and other communications in the
SHARE
application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots and other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other
SHARE
users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots or other communications in the
SHARE
application is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information).
SHARE
is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.
SHARE
may also collect and gather user contents (e.g., photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials) that you create on the Service. Your photo can be taken by other users on the
SHARE
, and If they use capturing function provided by the
SHARE
, those photos can be stored and used for
SHARE
and 3rd party’s service(eg, Facebook, etc.). You can change sharing option of 3rd party on the
SHARE
settings. If you do not agree with all the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases. In general these reports do not contain personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. As part of these error reports, we receive information about the type and version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and fixing the error.
Sharing of your information
We will not rent or sell your information to third parties (or the group of companies of which
SHARE
is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.
Your User Profile
The information you enter into your user profile (your “Profile”) may be shared with your
SHARE
contacts. You control your Profile and you can access and modify your Profile from the
SHARE
application at any time. In addition, if you register with
SHARE
using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give us your express consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is available to other users of the Service who are connected to you on
SHARE
. In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any time in the
SHARE
application), your Profile is discoverable by other
SHARE
users, including by way of example in listings of contacts that will include your proximity to other users. You may also “block out” any
SHARE
user in your contact list from discovering your Profile at any time. In addition,
SHARE
may pre-populate your Profile with certain information such as your name and Facebook profile picture if you or your friends have logged onto the Service using Facebook.
Data Access and Removal
You can always control what information you choose to share with us on the Service. To do so, you can change your settings in the Service or in your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the Service from your mobile device entirely.
