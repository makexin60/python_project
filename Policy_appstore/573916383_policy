6. Cases where we may use your information to contact you
We may contact you:
for administration reasons related to the Services (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service, activity or online content has been suspended for maintenance, or in response to a question that you ask us)
to provide you with information about our Services, activities or online content, including sending e-newsletters or similar correspondence and updates or responding to any contact you have made with us, e.g. on our Websites, through our mobile applications, by email or via the ‘
How To Contact Us
’ section below

for direct marketing purposes.
7. Your rights
As a data subject, you have the following rights under Data Protection Laws and we, as controller in respect of Your Personal Data, will comply with such rights in respect of Your Personal Data. These rights are explained in more detail below, but if you have any comments, concerns or complaints about our use of Your Personal Data, please contact us (see ‘
How to Contact Us
’ below). We will respond to any rights that you exercise within one month of receiving your request, unless the request is particularly complex, in which case we will respond within three months (we will inform you within the first month if it will take longer than one month for us to respond).
Right
Further Information
Right of Access (Article 15 GDPR)
You have the right to request a copy of Your Personal Data. Requests for Your Personal Data must be made to us (see ‘
How to Contact Us
’ below) specifying what Personal Data you need access to, and a copy of such request may be kept by us for our legitimate purposes in managing the Services. To help us find the information easily, please give us as much information as possible about the type of information you would like to see. If, to comply with your request, we would have to disclose information relating to or identifying another person, we may need to obtain the consent of that person, if possible. If we cannot obtain consent, we may need to withhold that information or edit the data to remove the identity of that person, if possible.
We are also entitled to refuse a data access request from you where
such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character (in this case, if we decide to provide you with the Personal Data requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to account for administrative costs of doing so); or
we are entitled to do so pursuant to Data Protection Laws.
For security reasons, we will take reasonable steps to confirm your identity before providing you with any Personal Data we may hold about you.
Right of Rectification (Article 16 GDPR)
You have the right to request that we amend any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data that we have about you. If you would like to do this, please
email or write to us (see ‘
How to Contact Us’
below);
let us have enough information to identify you (e.g. name, registration details); and
let us know the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with.
If we are required to update Your Personal Data, we will inform recipients to whom that Personal Data have been disclosed (if any), unless this proves impossible or has a disproportionate effort.
It is your responsibility that all of the Personal Data provided to us is accurate and complete. If any information you have given to us changes, please let us know as soon as possible (see ‘
How to Contact Us’
below).
Right to Object (Article 21 GDPR)
You have the right to ask us to stop using Your Personal Data, and we will comply unless there is a legal basis for us to continue using it, which we will explain to you.
Right to Erasure (Article 17 GDPR)
You can ask us to erase Your Personal Data
where we do not need Your Personal Data in order to process it for the purposes set out in this Policy;
if you had given us consent to process Your Personal Data, you withdraw that consent and we cannot otherwise legally process Your Personal Data;
you object to our processing and we do not have any legal basis for continuing to process Your Personal Data;
Your Personal Data has been processed unlawfully or have not been erased when it should have been; or
the Personal Data have to be erased to comply with law.
We may continue to process Your Personal Data in certain circumstances in accordance with Data Protection Laws. Where you have requested the erasure of Your Personal Data, we will inform recipients to whom that Personal Data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will also inform you about those recipients if you request it.
Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18 GDPR)
You may request that we stop processing Your Personal Data temporarily if
you do not think that Your Personal Data is accurate (but we may start processing again once we have checked and confirmed that it is accurate);
the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase Your Personal Data;
we no longer need the Personal Data for our processing; or
you have objected to processing because you believe that your interests should override the basis upon which we process Your Personal Data.
If you exercise your right to restrict us from processing Your Personal Data, we will continue to process the Personal Data if:
you consent to such processing;
the processing is necessary for the exercise or defence of legal claims;
the processing is necessary for the protection of the rights of other individuals or legal persons; or
the processing is necessary for public interest reasons.
Right to Data Portability (Article 20 GDPR)
You may ask for an electronic copy of Your Personal Data that you have provided to us and which we hold electronically, or for us to provide this directly to another party. This right only applies to Personal Data that you have provided to us – it does not extend to data generated by us. In addition, the right to data portability also only applies where
the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract; and
the processing is carried out by automated means.
Right to be informed
You have the right to clear, transparent and easily understandable information about your rights and about how we use Your Personal Data. We use this Policy to inform you of your rights.
Right to Withdraw Consent
Where processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with future effect by contacting us. However, if you do withdraw your consent we may not be able to continue to provide the Services we offer to you.
Right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing
We have a legitimate interest to send you electronic communications in connection with the Services and related matters (which may include but shall not be limited to newsletters, announcement of new features etc. and which may also appear on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or Instagram). We may also ask you for your consent to send you direct marketing from time to time.

click on ‘unsubscribe’ on an email;
respond ‘stop’ on an SMS to a number notified to you; or
send an email via ‘
How to Contact Us’
below.
We will provide you with information on action taken on a request to stop direct marketing - this may be in the form of a response email confirming that you have ‘unsubscribed’. Unsubscribing from direct marketing does not unsubscribe you from essential electronic communications in respect of the administration of Your Account.
Rights in relation to automated decision making
We do not attempt to collect further data without user consent that enables personally identifiable profiling of our users.
Right to Complain to the DPC
If you do not think that we have processed Your Personal Data in accordance with this Policy, please contact us in the first instance (see ‘
How to Contact Us’
below). If you are not satisfied, you can complain to the DPC or exercise any of your other rights pursuant to Data Protection Laws. Information about how to do this is available on the DPC website at

We restrict access to Your Personal Data to employees, contractors, and agents who need such access in order to operate, develop, or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
We may disclose Your Personal Data to any business unit, company, or other corporate entity which is under the control and direction of the EPA. We may also, in the exercise of our official authority, disclose Your Personal Data to local government authorities, the Department of Health and/or other state agencies in relation to the promotion and co-ordination of environmental research or where required by law.

In a case where we have received Your Personal Data in connection with a research project which the EPA is co-funding, we may share Your Personal Data with our co-funding partner(s).
As mentioned above, with your consent or where we have a legitimate business interest, we may also use Your Personal Data or permit third parties to use Your Personal Data to contact you with marketing information about goods and services which may be of interest to you.
We may use a third-party service provider to send out our newsletter and administer our marketing mailing list.
We may also use service providers to assist us in running our Websites and Services or to help us run recruitment competitions. These service providers may have access to Your Personal Data in the course of providing their services and where this is the case, the service providers will be under strict contractual restrictions to ensure that Your Personal Data is protection in compliance with Data Protection Laws.

Your Personal Data may be disclosed to a third party if we are required to do so because of an applicable law, court order or governmental regulation, or if such disclosure is otherwise necessary in support of any criminal or other legal investigation or proceeding in Ireland or abroad.
9. Non-EEA personal data transfers
Your Personal Data may be transferred to, stored at, or accessed from a destination outside the EEA (a ‘
third country
’) for the purposes of us providing the Services. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, another corporate entity within our group, or any of our suppliers. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your Personal Data is treated securely and to an acceptable EU standard.
The safeguards in place with regard to the transfer of Your Personal Data to third countries shall include (but shall not be limited to) reliance by us on a decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the respective third country, the entry by us into appropriate contracts with third parties incorporating standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission where required or reliance other appropriate safeguards and the carrying out of risk assessments and adoption of supplementary and/or mitigating measures to ensure compliance with Data Protection Laws.
10. Third party websites
This Policy applies to websites, mobile applications and Services that are owned and operated by us. We do not exercise control over the sites/applications that may be linked from the Services. You may see ‘social buttons’ during your use of the Websites or mobile applications, including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram which enable you to share or bookmark certain web pages.
These websites and social platforms have their own cookies and privacy practices, which are controlled by them. These other sites/applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. You acknowledge that the Services may enable or assist you to access the website content of, correspond with, and purchase goods and services from, third parties via third-party websites and that you do so solely at your own risk.
We make no representation or commitment and shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever in relation to the content or use of, or correspondence with, any such third-party website, or any transactions completed, and any contract entered into by you, with any such third party and the use by any such third-party of Your Personal Data. We do not endorse or approve any third-party website nor the content of any of the third-party website made available via the Services.
We encourage you to carefully familiarize yourself with the terms of use and privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties.
11. Offensive content
If Your Personal Data or any User Uploaded Data contains any material which may reasonably be deemed to be offensive, inappropriate or objectionable or you otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour in relation to the Services, we may remove such content and/or suspend the use of Your Account at any time. We may also remove any such material from any of our social media pages.
Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws, for example on hate speech, we may disclose Your Personal Data to relevant third parties, including to law enforcement agencies or your internet provider. We would only do so in circumstances where such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws, including Data Protection Laws.
12. How we protect your personal data
We do our utmost to protect user privacy through the appropriate use of security technology. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing of Your Personal Data. In particular, we consider the risks presented by accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Your Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
We restrict access to Your Personal Data to employees, contractors and agents who need to know Your Personal Data in order to operate, develop or improve the Services. We ensure that we have appropriate physical and technological security measures to protect your information and we ensure that when we outsource any processes that the service provider has appropriate security measures in place. However, our Websites or mobile applications may contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third-party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect Your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to us and any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received Your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or any other loss or damage resulting from:
the transfer of data over communications networks and facilities, including the internet, or
any delay or delivery failure on the part of any other service provider not contracted by us, and you acknowledge that our Services may be subject to limitations, delays and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities.
You will appreciate that we cannot guarantee the absolute prevention of cyber-attacks such as hacking, spyware and viruses. Accordingly, you will not hold us liable for any unauthorized disclosure, loss or destruction of Your Personal Data arising from such risks.
All information you provide to us is stored on our (or contracted third party) secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access any part of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with any person not authorised to use the Services.
13. Personal data breach reporting
We will notify serious Personal Data Breaches in respect of Your Personal Data to the DPC without undue delay, and where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of same. If notification is not made after 72 hours, we will record a reasoned justification for the delay. However, it is not necessary to notify the DPC where the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. A
Personal Data Breach
in this context means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
We will keep a record of any Personal Data Breaches, including their effects and the remedial action taken, and will notify you of any Personal Data Breach affecting Your Personal Data (which poses a high risk to you) when we are required to do so under Data Protection Laws. We are not required to notify you of a Personal Data Breach where:
we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures that render Your Personal Data unintelligible to anyone not authorised to access it, such as encryption
we have taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to data subjects is not likely to materialise; or
it would involve disproportionate effort, in which case we may make a public communication instead.
14. Retention of personal data
Your Personal Data will be kept and stored for such period of time as we deem necessary taking into account the purpose for which it was collected in the first instance in line with our data retention policy. This may include retaining Your Personal Data as necessary to administer Your Account, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, support business operations, and continue to develop and improve our Services.
Where we retain information for our Services improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyse personal characteristics about you.
15. Amendments to policy
We may change or update our Policy from time to time and at our sole discretion. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on the top of this Policy. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use the Services, Websites or mobile applications. If material changes are made to the Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our Websites or by sending you a notification in relation to this.
16. How to contact us
If you need to contact us with regard to any of your rights as set out in this Policy, all such requests should be made sent by email to
