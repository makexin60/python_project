We reserve the right to change this policy at any time, so please check back regularly to keep informed of updates to this policy.
We use cookies to improve your experience on our website. However, your consent is needed for certain cookies before they can be used. You can also choose which cookies you allow us to use, apart from essential cookies, which can’t be turned off.

Frequently asked questions
The Data Controller is Tesco Mobile Limited (collectively referred to as “we” or “us” in this Policy).
We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data. That’s why we’ve developed this privacy and cookies policy (“Policy”), which:
Sets out the types of personal data that we collect;
Explains how and why we collect and use your personal data;
Explains when and why we will share personal data within the Tesco Group and with other organisations; and
Explains the rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data.
We offer different products and services, so we want you to be clear about what the Policy covers. If you use our services(referred to in this Policy as “our Services”). Using our Services means:
Shopping with us over the phone, or online or otherwise use any of the websites (“our Website”) or mobile applications (“our Mobile Apps”) where this Policy is posted; or
Use our mobile communications network (the "Network").
This Policy also applies if you contact us or we contact you about our Services.
Some other parts of our business, and other Tesco Group Companies, or Service Providers such as Telefonica UK Limited (“O2”), may need to collect and use personal data to provide you with their products and services and for certain other purposes. They have their own privacy policies that explain how they use your personal data.
Our Website or Mobile Apps may contain links to other websites operated by other organisations that have their own privacy policies. Please make sure you read their terms and conditions and privacy policy carefully before providing any personal data on a website as we do not accept any responsibility or liability for websites of other organisations.
This section tells you what personal data we may collect from you when you use our Services and what other personal data we may receive from other sources.
When you register for our Services, you may provide us with –
Your personal details, including your postal and billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and date of birth and title;
Your debit or credit card details, bank details and other payment information;
Your identity document(s) that help us verify your identity or your authority to represent a Tesco Mobile customer;
Your Clubcard number;
Your account login details, such as your username and the password that you have chosen;
Details of any additional support requirement due to a health, financial or situational circumstance.
When you shop with us ( in our stores, over the phone or online) or browse our Website or use our Mobile Apps, we may collect –
Information about your purchases (for example what you have bought, when and where you bought it and how you paid for it);
Information about your online browsing behaviour on our Website and Mobile Apps and information about when you click on one of our advertisements (including those shown on third party websites);
Information about any devices you have used to access our Services; (including device make, model and operating system, IP address, browser type and mobile device identifiers);
Information about when and how much you top up and pay your bill or how often and why you access your account with us.
When you use Clubcard to shop with us, or redeem Clubcard vouchers or coupons, we may collect –
Transaction information, including the in-store and online purchases for which you earn Clubcard points.
When you contact us or we contact you or you take part in promotions, competitions, surveys or questionnaires in relation to our Services, we may collect –
Personal data you provide about yourself anytime you contact us about our services, (for example, your name, username and contact details) including by phone, email or post when you speak with us through social media;
Details of the emails and other digital communications we send to you that you open, including any links in them that you click on;
Your feedback and contributions to customer surveys and questionnaires.
When you use our Network –
Your call, text, surfing, network usage and billing records and your usage records from our Tesco Mobile named apps - this includes the date and time you use them, how long for, where you use them and how much it costs. We don't look at the content of your messages or listen to your calls (unless you are talking to one of our customer service advisors)
Your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet over our Network (we call this Network Location). Network Location finds you through phone masts nearby and only knows roughly where you are;
We need to know your Network Location so we can connect you to the Network to put calls and texts through or connect you to the Internet.
Your smartphone might also have a Global Positioning System (GPS) location, that's used by your phone and certain apps. It's more accurate than network location alone, because it uses satellites. If you're using some of our apps, including Tesco Group apps, we might collect some of your GPS location information.
GPS location is different from network location. We don't control it. GPS is based on satellites and is set up on the phone itself. Look at your phone's settings to configure it. Remember, if you choose not to share your location, you might not be able to use certain services that need to know where you are for those services to work.
Other sources of personal data
We may also use personal data from other sources, such as specialist companies that supply information, online media channels, our Retail Partners and public registers. For example, this other personal data helps us to —
Review and improve the accuracy of the data we hold;
Improve and measure the effectiveness of our marketing communications, including online advertising.
We also access Clubcard information from Tesco Stores and may access information where permissible from Tesco Bank. We may take this information into account when assessing credit risk. For example, we may take into account a Clubcard holder’s loyalty reflected in Clubcard transactions. This means that Clubcard information can improve your eligibility for our credit and insurance products. We will also receive your personal data from any friend of yours who recommends you as part of our Recommend a Friend programme.

This section explains how and why we share personal data with Credit Reference Agencies.
We and our service providers will search your record at credit reference agencies who will supply us with credit information, as well as information from the Electoral Register, about you. We may use credit scoring or other automated decision-making systems when assessing your application and verifying your identity. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by us and other companies on an ongoing basis to make other credit decisions about you, or other members of your household to support responsible lending. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of fraud and money laundering as well as the management of your account. Information held about you by the credit reference agencies may already be linked to records relating to one or more of your partners and you may be treated as financially linked, which means your application will be assessed with reference to any associated records. Prior to such an assessment, you will first need to get your partner’s consent before their information is disclosed. More information about Credit Reference Agencies and how they use personal information is available at
Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN)| Equifax UK
This section explains how and why we share personal data with Fraud Prevention Agencies.
To verify your identity and to help prevent fraud and money laundering, we and our service providers may work with fraud prevention agencies to access, use and share the information that’s held and has been collected by us or them. This could be for checking credit applications, debt recovery, insurance applications and claims, and checking details of job applicants and employees. If fraud is found, you could be refused services, finance, or employment. To find out more about your rights and how we collect, use, and share your personal data, please read the relevant sections of our privacy policy.
Full Fraud Prevention Notice
GENERAL
Before we provide services, goods, or financing to you, we undertake checks for the purposes of preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity. These checks require us to process personal data about you.
The personal data you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have received from third parties will be used to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity.
Details of the personal information that will be processed, for example: name, address, date of birth, contact details, financial information, employment details, and device identifiers including IP address and vehicle details.
We and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
We process your personal data on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify identity, to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.
AUTOMATED DECISIONS
As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct; or is inconsistent with your previous submissions; or you appear to have deliberately hidden your identity.
You have rights in relation to automated decision-making to request a second opinion: If you want to know more, please contact us using the details provided.
CONSEQUENCES OF PROCESSING
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services and financing you have requested, or to employ you, or we may stop providing existing services to you.
A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing, or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details provided.
DATA TRANSFERS
Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ intended to enable secure data sharing.
YOUR RIGHTS
Your personal data is protected by legal rights, which include your rights to object to our processing of your personal data; request that your personal data be erased or corrected; and request access to your personal data.
For more information or to exercise your data protection rights please, contact us using the contact details provided in the other data protection rights below.

This section explains how and why we share personal data with other companies within the Tesco Group
.
Tesco Group Companies work closely together to ensure that we serve our customers a little better each day. As a result, some information about you may be shared with other Tesco companies for the following reasons, which include: (i) Joint Marketing Activities; (ii) Joint Customer Insight and Analysis; (iii) Clubcard-related services such as allocation of Clubcard points; and (iv) Clubcard Plus related services. Joint marketing will be done where the marketing incorporates a Clubcard element and your marketing preferences with each Group company will be applied. Should your marketing preferences indicate that you wish to receive Clubcard related marketing, you may receive Clubcard related products, prices or savings regarding other Tesco Group companies in marketing communications. Joint Customer Insight and Analysis will be done for the benefit of the customer and will not result in a negative impact on the customer.
We share personal data with the following Tesco Group companies:
Tesco Bank

Tesco Bank may use the information we provide to determine the level of discounts offered on premiums for some insurance products. You can find more information about the way in which Tesco Bank uses data in its
Privacy & Cookies Policy.
Tesco Stores
We provide Clubcard information we have collected from you with Tesco Stores so they can allocate your Clubcard points which relate to your spending with us.

This section explains how and why we share personal data with Retail Partners and Service Providers.
When we share personal data with these companies, we require them to keep it safe, and they must not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.
Retail Partners
We work with Retail Partners who –
Sell products through our Services, for example when you use the Tesco Mobile Xtras app powered by Unlocked;
Offer products, services and/or the ability to earn points through Clubcard;
Provide insurance when you purchase a device contract with us; or
Provide cash for your old phones when you use our trade–in services.
We only share personal data that enables our Retail Partner to provide their services. For example, we may share information about your purchases at Tesco to facilitate the delivery of personalised offers. Whilst Retail Partners can market their products and services to you via our Services, they must not use the personal data for their own direct marketing, and we require them to keep your personal data secure.
Service Providers
We work with carefully selected Service Providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. These include, for example, companies that help us with customer care services, network provision such as O2 and technology services, storing and combining data, credit checking, processing payments and delivering orders.
We only share personal data that enables our Service Providers to provide their services.
Some of the Service Providers we work with operate online media channels, and they place relevant online advertising for our products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and our Retail Partners, on those online media channels on our behalf. For example, you may see an advertisement for our products and services as you use a particular social media site or watch television through your pay TV account.
This section explains how and why we share personal data with other organisations.
We may share personal data with other organisations in the following circumstances:
If the law or a public authority says we must share personal data;
If we need to share personal data to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (this includes providing personal data to others for the purposes of preventing fraud and reducing credit risk);
To an organisation we sell or transfer (or enter negotiations to sell or transfer) any of our businesses or any of our rights or obligations under any agreement we may have with you. If the transfer or sale goes ahead, the organisation receiving your personal data can use your personal data in the same way as us; or
To any other successors in title to our business;
Credit reference agencies: We will share details of your credit agreement with us, the payments you make under it and any default or failure to keep to its terms. The credit reference agency will record details of our search of their database, and whether your application proceeds; and
Fraud prevention agencies: If when placing an order with us false or inaccurate information is provided by you and fraud is identified or suspected, your details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.
We know how important it is to protect and manage your personal data. This section sets out some of the measures we have in place, which include:
We make sure staff are trained and rules are in place to make sure that data is used properly.
We have physical protections and digital/electronic systems in place to keep what we hold secure.
When data is moved or transferred, we make sure it's encrypted (scrambled) using Secure Sockets Layers (SSL).
We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption to keep this data safe when it's not being moved.
We only allow access to colleagues and trusted partners on a need-to-know basis to carry out their job responsibilities.
We will reveal only the last four digits of your credit card number when confirming an order
We regularly watch our systems for possible weaknesses and attacks, and we carry out tests (penetration testing) to see what can be improved. We’ll ask for proof of identity before we share your personal data with you.
International Transfers
Your personal data may be transferred outside the UK. It may also be processed by companies outside the UK who work for us (or for one of our service providers). When we do this, your personal data will be subject to appropriate protections. If we do transfer personal data outside of the UK, it'll be protected in the same way as if it was being used in the UK. To do this, we use one of the following safeguards:
We transfer to a non-UK country whose privacy laws ensure an appropriate level of protection for personal data.
We put in place a contract with a third party which means they must protect personal data to the same standards as the UK.
We transfer personal data to organisations that are part of specific agreements on cross-border data transfers with the UK.
We will not keep your personal data longer than we need to, how long this is dependent on several factors, including:
Why we collected it in the first place;
How old it is;
Whether there is a legal/regulatory reason for us to keep it; and
Whether we need it to protect you or us.
In most circumstances, we will not keep your data for more than 7 years.
This section explains the choices you have when it comes to receiving marketing communications and taking part in market research.
We will send you relevant offers and news about our products and services in a number of ways including by email, post or text, but only if you have not objected to receiving marketing communications. When you register with us we will ask if you object to receiving marketing communications, and you can change your marketing choices at any time by calling 282 from your Tesco Mobile phone or visiting your
preferences
.
If you receive a Recommend a Friend communication from us because your friend has recommended you, you can ask to stop any other friends recommending you for 12 months (or until the promotion ends), after that, if you don’t become a Tesco Mobile customer, we will delete your contact details. Unless you join Tesco Mobile or otherwise sign up to receive marketing separately from Recommend a Friend, we won’t send you any other communications.
We also like to hear your views to help us improve our Services, so we may contact you for market research purposes. You always have the choice about whether to take part in our market research.
