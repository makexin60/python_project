2. What personal data is processed and the legal basis for processing
There are different types of information we obtain, whether directly from you or automatically via your device when you use the App. Essentially, we only obtain what is strictly necessary to provide you with our services, no more, no less.
Information, relating to you or your device, is either identified automatically by Our systems, provided to Us by the operating system of your device or is input by you manually when filling out certain fields, authorizing certain actions in the Apps.
Information you provide Us with:Legal basis for processing
1. Email address when you log in to use the App as a registered user.
Performance of the contract with you.
Unless you sign up via other means (SNS, see below), We could not provide you with our services as a logged in user other than through some means of unique identification. You may still access Our App as a guest and link your account later.
We may contact you for marketing purposes of similar products and/or services. It will be in Our legitimate interests to do so, but you will always have a chance to opt out of such marketing communications prior to any such communication and every time thereafter.
We will store just enough information to honour your opt-out preference in the future.
2. Social Network information via the “OAuth” method for secure login (read more about OAuth by following the link
https://oauth.net/
)
Essentially, this is information from your public profile (with, for instance, Facebook) that you can control at any stage.
Performance of the contract with you.
Same as above, We could not otherwise provide you with our services as a registered user.
3. Your name and avatar (an image of your choice to be shown when playing the App)
Your consent at the time of provision of the same. You can always change or replace your name and avatar within the App settings.
4. Your date of birth when you provide it to our support team to get some freebies.
Your consent to receive freebies on that special day each year. We do not store the year of your birth, only the DD.MM. so to minimize the extent of personal data We hold about you.
5. Messages and communication with support
Performance of contract to respond to your queries and provide customer support. We do not use this information for anything else (for instance, we do not build your profile or target you based on your communication with us or with other users of the App).
Strange, but that is it. The rest is the technical stuff that must be processed in order to provide you with our services.
Information collected automatically or assigned by Us to youLegal basis for processing
1. The server that hosts the App may record requests your device makes to the server, the details on device and browser you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country, operating system, browser type, mobile network information.

The App would not operate otherwise, you need this to connect to the Internet.
This data is used only for technical purposes – that is, to ensure the proper functioning and security of the App and to investigate possible security incidents.
2. Advertising identifiers provided by the operating system of your handheld device (such as, for instance, IDFA, GAID)
Your consent to the provision of such identifiers given by default through the operating system of your device (Apple or Android, for instance). You are free to withdraw your consent by resetting those identifiers or opting out of interest based advertising.
This may be done via the settings of your handset and/or your browser. We respect those choices you make through the settings of your device.
3. Various device identifiers, provided by the operating system (device ID or a vendor ID, for instance) or allocated by Us (your in-App ID, for instance)

4. App version, OS version information, browser type, language used, make/model of your device
Performance of the contract.
We need to know this technical information so the App functions properly on your device.
5. All the events that naturally occur during your usage of the App (such as logs, events, hands played, purchase history, crashes of the App, system reports and so on). Statistical information with regards to App usage.
Partly, performance of the contract and partly our legitimate interests in fraud prevention and potential unauthorized access, ensuring the technical availability and security of the App.
Analysis of statistical information helps us to optimize the App in future updates, such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any personal data of yourself or your contacts.
3. What we do with your personal data
We protect your data and do not treat your personal data in any way that would surprise you (unless We told you about it and you made an informed decision to consent to such usage).
For instance, We encrypt the password created by you at the sign up stage and then store your personal data on secure servers that would prevent unauthorized access or destruction.
We use the advertising identifiers in strict compliance with the requirements of the operating systems (for otherwise We would be in breach of their usage terms). Thus, We only use those advertising identifiers to meet our contractual obligations towards the parties that brought you to Us and vice versa (whether by you clicking on an advertising banner in our partners’ apps, watching the ad or otherwise).
Unless you have asked us not to, We may rarely contact you by email about similar products and services to the App. Whenever We contact you, We would always give you the right to opt out prior to the first communication and at any time thereafter (see the section
“Your Rights”
below).
The purposes for processing the data provided by you include:
Providing you with Our services
Fraud prevention
Improving our services
Notifying you of any changes in our services
4. How long personal data is stored for
Depending on the type, your personal data is stored either until you delete the App or after six months of inactivity. Some data (such as IP addresses or blacklisted email addresses used for fraud) may be held for longer in our legitimate interests to protect our business from losses and also to respect your choice of opt-outs from marketing emails.
We are required by law to delete any information that is no longer necessary to provide Service to you. We assume that if you have not used our App for over six months (“
Period of Inactivity
”), you have left us indefinitely. We will delete any Personal Data that we have in our possession following the Period of Inactivity. But do not worry, you are always welcome to use our App again if you decide to come back by setting up a new account.
5. Security measures used by Us
Your data is stored on one of the secure servers that we rent and We use the recommended industry practices to keep your data secure. We use appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

the data processors (service providers) that act solely upon our instructions and in the performance of our duties to you;
as stated in this privacy policy; or
where We have to comply with a legal obligation.
This does not mean that We blindly follow disclosure orders. We will check each request to ensure it satisfies the relevant safeguards, contains a court order or is issued under a legislative measure for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences.
Independent Controllers
Once you access the rewarded ads section, you may be able to obtain free in-game virtual currency (as defined in our terms and conditions) in return for certain actions. As with everything else in this world, if you are not paying for the product – you are the product. Hence, your personal data (non-invasive and general in most cases, as described in each controller’s privacy policy below) will be processed by an independent third party that gets some benefit for processing your personal data for further targeted advertising.
For Android users only:
Tapjoy, Inc. is an independent controller and processes your personal data in accordance with their privacy policy available at
https://www.tapjoy.com/legal/#privacy-policy
(
last accessed on December 11, 2019)
. The type of information processed by Tapjoy is listed in their privacy policy and includes certain device information as well as app and ad information. Please, read through their privacy policy for further information. Your personal data is accessed by Tapjoy only after you have accessed the particular section of our app by clicking on it following a prompt (consent through affirmative action). Once you have agreed and proceed to access the rewarded ads section, we have no further control over the extent to which Tapjoy complies with its own privacy policy. Should you wish to exercise your rights in relation to such personal data passed to Tapjoy, you will need to contact them directly. You can find all the relevant information on their website with relevant links and advice.
For iOS and Android users:
Unity Technologies Finland OY (“Unity”) is an independent controller that is used by and processes your personal data in accordance with their privacy policy available at
https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy
(last accessed on December 11, 2019)
. Most apps (including ours) was developed using Unity software. Unity automatically collects certain device information from the outset (as listed in their privacy policy). With regards to the Unity Ads section, Unity, among others, collects the following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one you’re playing have downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game you see advertised. All of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that you might like to download.
If you are in the EU and do not wish to be targeted in this manner, the first Unity ad you see in an app (as of May 25, 2018) explains how you can opt-out of data collection in that particular game. You can opt-out then or at any time by clicking or tapping the “ℹ” button (or Data Privacy icon) on any ad you see (the “ℹ” button or Data Privacy icon will also allow you to access the data that is collected about you in that particular app). For example, you might see a summary   that includes information indicating that  Unity see that you are using an iPhone 8 and you are playing from Germany. In the past week you were seen 5 times in this game and have been shown 27 ads. You have installed 0 games based on those ads.
Additionally, all users, regardless of their location, may opt-out of all personalized advertising by enabling privacy features on their devices such as Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) and Opt Out of Ads Personalization (Android). See your device’s Help system for more information.
7. Transfer of your data abroad
While your data may be accessed from different parts of the world on our behalf, We do not actually transfer your personal data outside the EEA. To any extent that data is accessed from abroad, We follow set contractual safeguards and protections to ensure that your data is as safe abroad as it is within the EEA.
Where a third party accesses your data on our behalf or upon our instructions (be it inside or outside the EEA), We use the relevant legal basis to comply with the data protection legislation. In cases where there is no finding of an adequacy decision by the European Commission, we use model contracts to safeguard your rights and data.
8. Social Network Services (SNS)
When you log in to use any of Our Apps via an SNS (such as Facebook) you provide Us with certain information from you profile for that site. The information provided via SNS varies and depends on a particular SNS (for instance, Facebook provides information on your name, age range, picture, gender, friends list and email address). You can untick the boxes for information you prefer not to share with us during the sign up process.
You can find out more about these settings at the SNS where you play Our App (for instance, you can edit the privacy and settings of your apps with Facebook by following the link
https://www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=about_content
- last accessed on December 11, 2019).
Your activity when playing the App via an SNS will also be subject to the SNS’ privacy policy for their part of data processing.
9. Your rights
You are entitled to the full spectrum of the rights under the General Data Protection Regulation and We will go out of our way to accommodate any valid request. You can either exercise your rights by deleting certain features through your device or by emailing us at
support@kamagames.com
to exercise all the other rights.
You have a wide array of rights that we respect. Among those the right to:
Require access to your personal data;
Require rectification of your personal data;
Require erasure of your personal data;
Withdraw consent to processing of your personal data, where applicable;
Lodge a complaint with your national supervisory authority (in the EEA) if you believe that your privacy rights have been breached;
Not to be discriminated against for exercising any of your rights.
You may be required to prove through a certain procedure that the request emanates from the data subject (i.e. contact us from within the app itself and confirm a code that we would send to the registered email address). This is so that we do not disclose personal data to those that are not entitled to it.
If your personal data is erased at your request or in accordance with our data retention policy, We only retain such information that is necessary to protect our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.
Please note, all requests should be emailed to Us at
support@kamagames.com
, sent to us by post or via an App’s related internet website (where applicable).
10. Children’s privacy
The Apps are intended strictly for over 18 year old persons. We never knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone of 13 years and younger. The App and its content are not directed at nor made look to appeal to such persons. Parents or guardians that believe that We hold information about their children aged 13 and under may contact Us at
support@kamagames.com
11. Cookies and similar technologies
We use certain cookies when you visit Our Websites, but We give you an opportunity to choose which of those optional, non-essential cookies you would want to keep. Check the relevant cookie policy for the website you are visiting.
There is no consensus on how mobile application companies should interpret the DNT signals. For the purposes of the CalOPPA, We do not currently respond to DNT signals whether that signal has been received on a computer or a mobile device.
12. Notice to California Residents
For the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”):
1) We do not sell nor share consumer personal information as per sections 1798.140(ad)(2) and 1798.140(ah)(2) respectively.
2) In accordance with section 1798.130(a)(5):
the list of your rights is specified in section 9 of this privacy policy;
the categories of personal information We collect and have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months and the business purpose for collection are listed in section 2 of this privacy policy.
3) In accordance with section 1798.130(a)(1)(A) and (B), consumers can contact us via an email address provided herein. And where an internet website is separately accessible for a particular App, that internet website is also available to submit any requests consumers may have.
4) As per the last sentence of section 1798.130(a)(2)(A), We do not wish to collect more information than we already hold about consumers when dealing with verifiable requests, and, as such, We require the consumers to use the account they hold with us to submit a verifiable consumer request.
Put simply, We have an obligation to reduce the risk of processing unauthorized requests. Thus, if you contacted us from an email address asking for information relating to a user with a completely different email address and user ID, We would ask you to use the in-App chat to authenticate the request. And this has to be done to a reasonably high degree of certainty.
5) You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to do this, you should, firstly, provide the agent with written and signed permission to submit a request on your behalf. Secondly, you must verify your own identity directly with us and confirm the authority of the agent. Please, note that We retain the right to refuse a request from an allegedly authorized agent absent the legal proof of authority.
14. Contact us
Feel free to contact us at any time should you have any questions in relation to this privacy policy, either via email, by post or within App.

2. ADVERTISING SERVICE AND ADVERTISER OBLIGATIONS
2.1 Insertion Orders.
You and Tapjoy may agree upon IOs or other contracting mechanisms governed by these Terms that specify the details of your campaign, including: the type and quantity of ad placements; the bid price per Conversion desired; the maximum campaign budget; and the campaign start and end dates. IO details, such as bid price and campaign dates, may be subsequently modified by email confirmation or agreement. You acknowledge that budget allocations and daily targets are estimates only.
2.2 Campaign Content, Tracking, and License.
You will deliver your Campaign Content and implement conversion tracking in accordance with the applicable Tapjoy technical specifications, and Tapjoy will make commercially reasonable efforts to serve your Campaign Content to the Inventory in accordance with the IO and as otherwise directed by you based on your selections in the Tapjoy Dashboard. As between you and us, you are solely responsible for your costs to produce and deliver Campaign Content, and for the content of your Campaign Content. You hereby grant to Tapjoy the worldwide, non-sublicensable (except to the extent required by Tapjoy to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement), non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, right and license to use, serve, copy, reproduce, distribute and display, in any medium now known or hereafter developed, the Campaign Content, along with the data referenced in Section 4 (Data Use). Tapjoy will not modify or alter your Campaign Content without your prior written consent, except as required for or otherwise incidental to technical implementation by Tapjoy of your campaign.
2.3 Tapjoy Dashboard.
You may use Tapjoy’s online campaign management portal (currently
https://dashboard.tapjoy.com/
) (the “
Tapjoy Dashboard
”) to make campaign-related selections, including setting the campaign budget, sums to be spent on a daily basis, and dates or targets for delivery of Campaign Content. You understand that, because the Advertising Services involve users’ independent decisions about whether to engage with your Campaign Content, the sums allocated for a particular day, targets for delivery, and budget allocation between ad units are estimates and not guaranteed; to this end, Tapjoy is not liable if your advertising spend on a particular day is less (or more) than the intended amount. By way of example, if you set a daily spend limit, Tapjoy may need to serve additional Campaign Content in order to drive the requested number of Conversions because not all Campaign Content will necessarily result in a Conversion. Your Tapjoy Dashboard account is specific to you and should not be shared with third parties, except to the extent you authorize an agency to operate it on your behalf, and you are responsible for any account activities, whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for protecting the security of your account credentials and notifying Tapjoy immediately of any unauthorized access or use or other security breach.
2.4 Limited Transparency and Non-Circumvention.
The identity of apps and publishers within the Inventory is Tapjoy Confidential Information subject to Section 6 (Confidentiality) and is provided to you solely for the purposes of brand safety and campaign optimization. You agree not to use the Advertising Service to identify these apps or publishers and intentionally bypass our Advertising Service to work directly with them.
2.5 Content Maturity and Targeting.
You agree to ensure that your Campaign Content will be appropriately targeted and tagged, including but not limited to maturity level; that no Campaign Content will be directed to children under 13; that any Campaign Content directed to youths (meaning users younger than 18) will comply with the guidelines of the applicable local self-regulatory organization (e.g., the Children’s Advertising Review Unit in the U.S.) in the region(s) targeted by the applicable campaign; and that your use of the Service will be in compliance with applicable Laws.
2.6 Data Privacy.
As a condition of using our Advertising Services, you agree to be bound by our Tapjoy
DPA
, absent a separate written agreement with us with substantially similar terms regarding our respective obligations under applicable data protection Laws. You represent and warrant that you have notice and consent mechanisms in place that are sufficient to allow us to use data provided by or on behalf of you to Tapjoy in connection with the Advertising Service for conversion tracking, provision, monitoring, improvement and diagnosis of the Advertising Service, filtering and targeting of campaigns, and otherwise in accordance with any expressed user desires (e.g., opt-outs), the
Privacy Policy
, and, if applicable, the Tapjoy
DPA
. You and we will each maintain a privacy policy in accordance with all applicable Laws that accurately describes our respective practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data under this Agreement.
2.7 Prohibitions.
You agree not to attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Advertising Service or prevent others from accessing or using the Advertising Service; or otherwise use the Advertising Service in a manner not expressly authorized hereunder or for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose, and to promptly notify us in writing if you become aware of any breach of this Section. Without reducing your obligations, Tapjoy reserves the right, without obligation, to review Campaign Content or your use of the Advertising Service to determine whether a breach of this Agreement has occurred, or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.
2.8 Video Campaigns.
The minimum attribution window for video campaigns billed on a CPI basis, unless otherwise specified, is seven (7) days after completed video view or user-initiated click
2.9 Offerwall Campaigns.
For Offerwall campaigns (CPA, CPE, CPI, MR-CPE), the following terms apply:
a. Attribution Windows (unless otherwise agreed):
(i) CPA – maximum of sixty (60) days;
(ii) CPE – maximum of ninety (90) days;
(iii) CPI – minimum of forty-eight (48) hours;
(iv) MR-CPE – maximum of ninety (90) days.
b. User Experience. To help provide a high quality experience for users engaging with your offers, you agree to clearly, accurately, and prominently represent all requirements relevant to a user’s completion of your offer, to signal Tapjoy each time a user completes your offer, and to provide advance written notice of any material changes to your offer. Offer requirement disclosures must include, at minimum, the specific conversion action the user must complete to earn the reward and the rules and conditions applicable to the offer (e.g., “new users only”). If your Conversion signals will be delayed (e.g., if you batch Conversions and report them to Tapjoy once a day, rather than reporting them as they occur), your offer must accurately say so.
c. User Support. Tapjoy offers customer support to assist users who believe they earned, but have not received, offer rewards. To support these users, you agree to provide timely assistance in investigating support tickets, to collaborate with Tapjoy to resolve any technical issues affecting reward delivery, and to acknowledge Conversions validated through customer support as billable events.
3. PAYMENT
3.1 Invoices and Payment.
You will pay Tapjoy for all Conversions generated during each campaign. Invoices will be sent to you upon completion of every calendar month in which your applicable IO is active or within thirty (30) days of completion of the IO, whichever is earlier. All amounts are invoiced and must be paid in United States Dollars, with payments due net 30 of invoice. Any prepaid amounts are non-refundable.
3.2 Reporting.
Unless otherwise agreed to in the applicable IO or as stated in the applicable addendum below, Tapjoy’s measurements govern billing and reporting. Conversions are billable if they occur within the attribution window, if commenced before campaign termination or pause. Tapjoy reporting shall be made available to you via the Tapjoy Dashboard. All billing and transaction times referenced by Tapjoy reports are on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
3.3 Anti-Fraud Measures.
We employ systems designed to detect and block potentially fraudulent or invalid activity, but our systems cannot guarantee detection of all potentially suspect activity. Accordingly, to protect the Tapjoy network and alert Tapjoy to any potential issues, you acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing your campaign for any suspicious activity and reporting any such concerns as soon as possible and, in any case, by the payment due date of the applicable invoice. Claims based solely on analyses or reports by fourth-party fraud detection vendors will not be accepted. Notice should go by email to your Tapjoy Account Manager and include all evidence supporting your claim, with a copy to discrepancy@tapjoy.com.
3.4 Measurement or Other Discrepancies.
If you, in good faith, believe the invoiced amount is inaccurate, you may dispute the amount by notifying your Tapjoy Account Manager and providing your supporting documentation as soon as possible and, in any case, no later than the applicable invoice due date. You agree to reasonably cooperate with us to investigate your concern and reach a good faith resolution, and understand that failure to notify us before the applicable invoice due date waives your right to dispute it at a later date. We reserve the right to provide compensation in the form of marketing credits in lieu of cash. Tapjoy reserves the right to charge interest on undisputed invoices not timely paid, at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.
3.5 Taxes.
If withholding taxes or other taxes are imposed on you by your local jurisdiction, you shall promptly pay such taxes to ensure that Tapjoy receives the full amount invoiced to you without offset or deduction. Upon payment of such taxes, you will provide Tapjoy with the applicable receipts or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case within five (5) business days of written request.
3.6 Added Value.
If an IO indicates additional Conversions to be delivered at no extra cost to you (
“Added-Value Placements”
), they are non-guaranteed estimates and included for reference only. Fulfillment (or lack thereof) of Added-Value Placements does not affect campaign billing or reporting.
4. DATA USE
4.1. Your use of the Advertising Services generates data that we use to enhance and optimize the Advertising Services (
“Campaign Data”
). Campaign Data includes data about users’ interaction with your ads, such as ad impressions, users’ clicks, Conversions, or other interactions with your Campaign Content, and excludes personally identifiable information submitted by individual users directly to you as part of completing your ad offer (
“User-Volunteered Data”
). Campaign Data may be used by each of us to fulfill our respective obligations in accordance with an applicable IO, and as permitted under our respective privacy policies, applicable Laws, and this Agreement. As between you and Tapjoy, User-Volunteered Data is your property, subject to your posted privacy policy, and is considered your Confidential Information. The terms of this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.
4.2. You may choose to provide us with personal data for use solely for your benefit in connection with your use of the Advertising Service (e.g., targeting or suppression lists) (“
Advertising Service Data
”). You represent and warrant that you have notice and consent mechanisms in place that are sufficient to allow us to use Advertising Service Data for the purpose for which it was provided, and we agree to use that data specifically for the purpose provided (e.g., targeting or suppression).
5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP
As between the parties, and subject to the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement: You and your licensors own and will retain all right, title, and interest in and to your Campaign Content, and we and our licensors own and will retain all right, title, and interest in and to our Advertising Services, including all related information and software (and improvements and updates).
6. CONFIDENTIALITY
6.1 Confidential Information and Obligations.
Each of us agrees not to disclose the other’s Confidential Information, and to use it only to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement. “
Confidential Information
” means information identified as “confidential” or “proprietary” or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential. For purposes of this Agreement, Campaign Content (before publication) and any end-user data you provide for the purposes of campaign targeting or suppression are deemed your Confidential Information; and our pricing, pricing structures, statistics and other data relating to the Advertising Service, revenue, commercial partners, financial model, and methodologies are deemed Tapjoy Confidential Information. A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and/or advisors with a need to know, provided that they are under an obligation of confidentiality no less protective than this one.
6.2 Exclusions.
Confidential Information does not include information that was independently developed by the receiving party, that is or becomes publicly known without the receiving party’s fault, or that was lawfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information without breach of this Section, if required by act of law or order, provided that where feasible it gives the other party prompt notice of the requirement before disclosure, limits disclosure as much as possible, and provides its reasonable assistance to the other party if it seeks to obtain an order to protect the information from public disclosure.
6.3 Return/Destruction.
Upon the disclosing party’s reasonable request or the termination of this Agreement, the receiving party will promptly return or destroy the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and upon request certify in writing its return or destruction.
7. TERM AND TERMINATION
The term of this Agreement begins on the acceptance of these Terms and continues in effect until either party terminates this Agreement as set forth herein. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject or remove any Campaign Content and to restrict, pause or suspend your access to or use of the Advertising Services at any time and with or without notice, without liability to you. Either you or we may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon fourteen (14) days’ written notice; termination of this Agreement also terminates any outstanding IOs, but does not relieve you or us of any obligation to pay amounts due and owing as of the termination date; that obligation survives termination, and for avoidance of doubt, includes all Post Campaign Conversions whenever such conversions arise (even if after the date of termination). Sections 3 (with respect to any payment obligations then existing), 4 through 7, and 9 through 14 will survive expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.
8. MARKETING
You hereby grant us a royalty-free, fully paid up, sub-licensable, transferable, nonexclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to reproduce, display, distribute, and otherwise use, in connection with our Advertising Services, the trademarks, service marks, logos or other indicia of origin associated with you and your application(s) (your “
Marks
”), for the purpose of promoting you and your application(s) in our advertising, marketing, promotions and promotional materials. You agree that we may use your Marks on our website to show your use of our Advertising Services; for other proposed uses of your Marks, we will request your prior written approval.

9.2 Advertiser’s Campaign Content and Use of the Service.
Because the Service involves the display of your Campaign Content in the advertising inventory of third parties, you represent and warrant that your Campaign Content does not and will not: (a) infringe any third party rights, including rights arising from your contracts with third party as well as intellectual property rights, right of publicity or privacy, or other proprietary right, nor slanders, defames, libels, or otherwise harms any person; (b) include or distribute any malicious code, adware, malware, viruses or other similar software that could harm or expropriate data from a user’s device or the Service; (c) violate any applicable Law, including but not limited to consumer protection and advertising laws, nor otherwise subject Tapjoy to liability; or (d) contain, promote, or depict obscene or pornographic material, illegal products or services, illegally discriminate on the basis of any protected class, or otherwise be objectionable, as reasonably determined by Tapjoy.

The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement of any claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
11. DISCLAIMERS
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, TAPJOY, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATEs, DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PROVISION OR YOUR USE OF THE ADVERTISING SERVICES, OTHER TAPJOY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND THE TAPJOY NETWORK, IN EACH CASE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND; THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATIONS, WARRANTIES OF PERFORMANCE AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FURTHER, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES ARE OR WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, OR UNINTERRUPTED. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE: (A) THE RESULTS OF USE OF THE ADVERTISING SERVICE, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OR TIMING OF USER ACTIONS OR THE RESULTS OF ANY SPECIFIC CAMPAIGN, AND ADVERTISER ASSUMES ALL RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT THERETO; (B) THE POSITIONING, RANKING, RATING, LEVELS, OR TIMING OF DELIVERY OF ADVERTISER’S CAMPAIGN CONTENT ON SPECIFIC PUBLISHERS’ INVENTORY, OR CLICKS, CONVERSION RATES, OR OTHER USER ACTIONS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ADVERTISING SERVICE IS BASED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, ON AN AUCTION MODEL, AND CONSEQUENTLY VOLUMES MAY VARY BASED ON PRICE, CONVERSION RATES, USER ACTIONS, PUBLISHER CURRENCY SETTINGS, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY NOT BE WITHIN TAPJOY’S CONTROL. You acknowledge and agree that we are not affiliated with or responsible for your products or services or any third-party products or services displayed, distributed or otherwise promoted through our Advertising Services, including your Campaign Content and that of other advertisers related to their products or services. We neither represent nor endorse the quality, accuracy, reliability, integrity or legality of your or any third-party products or services, nor the truth or accuracy of the description of your or any third-party Campaign Content, including ads, offers, links, content, advice, opinions, offers, proposals, statements, data, or other information, provided by third parties and displayed, distributed, or otherwise used on or in connection with our Advertising Services.
12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; LIABILITY CAP
IN NO EVENT WILL TAPJOY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST INCOME, REVENUE OR PROFITS, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF WE KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF ALL LOSSES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL PAID OR PAYABLE TO TAPJOY UNDER THE IO TO WHICH THE CLAIM RELATES IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU; IN SUCH CASES, TAPJOY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND REFLECTS A FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK. WE WOULD NOT PROVIDE OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS, AND YOU AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS, AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE AND WILL SURVIVE EVEN IF OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES, THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY ELEMENT OF IT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED IN ITS OR THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BOTH PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE RAISED WITHIN 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ITS ACCRUAL, OR IT SHALL BE FOREVER WAIVED.

13. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
13.1 Governing Law.
The parties agree that California law governs this Agreement, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of law, and to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California for any claims not arbitrated as set forth below.
13.2 Arbitration.
Except for the exceptions described below, the parties agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including over its validity or enforceability) by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, before a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (collectively, “
JAMS Rules
”), as modified by this Agreement, and administered by JAMS; see
http://www.jamsadr.com
or call JAMS (1-800-352-5267 for JAMS Rules and fee information. Dispositive motions will be allowed; the arbitrator must follow this Agreement, will have the same power to award damages and relief as a court (including fees), and will issue a binding written decision, which can be enforced by entry of judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction. Both parties agree and understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial, and further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation, and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
13.3 Individual Actions Only.
EITHER OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF, AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PARTIES.
13.4 Exceptions.
The following are exceptions to the foregoing general agreement to arbitrate: (a) claims concerning intellectual property (i.e., patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks) and confidentiality (i.e., over Confidential Information or trade secrets); (b) claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Advertising Service; or (c) your failure to pay fees or the recovery of money owed by you to Tapjoy and (d) small claims, where jurisdiction and venue otherwise qualify for small claims court and where no equitable relief is sought (collectively, “
Excluded Claims
”). The parties agree to waive trial by jury in any litigation between them in court (e.g., if the arbitration provision is found unenforceable, or if the matter concerns one of the foregoing exceptions).
13.5 Applicability to Corporate Affiliates.
This Section will also apply to any claims asserted by you, or your parent, subsidiary, or corporate affiliate(s), against any Tapjoy parent, subsidiary, or corporate affiliate(s), and likewise to any claims asserted by any of them against you or your corporate affiliates, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Terms (including with respect to their validity or enforceability).
14. MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement, including the Tapjoy
DPA
and any IOs as applicable, sets forth the entire agreement between you and Tapjoy, and supersedes any prior or concurrent agreements (whether written or oral) with respect to its subject matter. In the event of conflict or inconsistency between an IO, these Terms, or the
DPA
, the documents shall govern and control in that order. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue our Services without notice and without liability to you or any third party. You cannot assign this Agreement without our prior written consent, and any attempt will be null and void; provided, however, that you may assign the Agreement without such consent to any entity that is not a competitor of Tapjoy in connection with the merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of your assets, or any other transaction in which more than fifty percent (50%) of your voting securities are transferred. This Agreement is binding upon permitted successors and assigns, and there are no third-party rights unless expressly specified. You and Tapjoy are independent contractors, not agents, representatives, or partners. Waiver of any breach of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other breach, and will not act to reduce the rights of the waiving party. In the case of conflict between or among these Terms, the IO, or the Tapjoy
DPA
, the order of precedence shall be the IO, then these Terms, then the Tapjoy
DPA
. Preprinted terms on purchase orders or other transactional documents are of no force or effect. Neither of us will be liable for failure to perform due to a cause beyond your or our reasonable control, respectively, including, without limitation, terrorism, fire, civil disturbance, war, rebellion, earthquake, flood and similar occurrences, provided that performance resumes as soon as commercially practicable after the cause no longer prevents performance. Headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation. Notice to Tapjoy shall be made via email to your Tapjoy account manager, with a copy to legal@tapjoy.com; notice to you shall be made to the email address in your Tapjoy dashboard advertiser account, in each case with copies sent by overnight courier to your and our mailing addresses as set forth in the most recent IO, marked “Attention: Legal”.
