Location information.
If you access the Site or App online, we may automatically detect your location so
                                that we can help you find Services in your general area. We may, depending on your
                                device, application, and operating system settings, directly collect precise
                                geographic location information and sensor data via GPS, cellular network
                                information, and other location-based features, including the latitude and longitude
                                of your device, as well as date and time. Most browsers and devices allow you to
                                disable collection of your precise geolocation. Please visit your browser’s or
                                device’s “Help” or “Settings” menu for more information.

                                integrate your use of our Services with any external platforms, we and those
                                platforms automatically collect, receive, and use personal information about you
                                based on your registration and settings with those services. Such information may

                                your interaction with the Services, with information they collect from other
                                sources. Please see Section 12 (“External Content, Links, and Plug-Ins”) for more
                                information. It is your choice whether to sign into or connect your other online
                                accounts with your use of our Services. Your use of any external platforms is
                                subject to those platforms’ privacy policies.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We also obtain personal information from third parties who have the right to provide such
                        information to us. For example, if we acquire another business that you have shopped at or
                        visited, that business may provide us your personal information as part of our acquisition. In
                        addition, we acquire certain information from data brokers and other third parties, including
                        address information that we use to validate or update your postal address or prevent fraud;
                        demographic and lifestyle information (such as the size of your household, age, and gender) to
                        help us analyze our business’ performance or improve the Services; and information about your
                        online and offline transactions and purchases to help us analyze or improve the Services. We
                        also receive personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address,
                        transaction details, and pet information, from our business partners when you participate in
                        joint marketing promotions, events, transactions, or similar partnerships or Services we offer
                        with third parties with whom we share a joint venture or similar business relationship.
3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We collect, use, retain, and share personal information collected from or about you for the
                        following purposes:
To provide and improve the Services.
For example, we use your personal information – such as your address and transaction
                                details – to fulfill, validate, manage, deliver, and/or track your transactions; process
                                payments; and to provide and improve our Services. We also use personal information to
                                analyze and improve the performance, usage and operations of our Services using internal
                                or external software and tools; to better understand who is using the Services and how;
                                to improve our marketing; and to develop new offerings.
To communicate with you.
For example, we use your personal information – such as your email address, telephone
                                number, address, online usernames, and other contact information – to respond to your
                                inquiries; to provide you with information about your account, purchases, transactions,
                                and our Services; to conduct surveys, sweepstakes, contests, focus groups, and
                                promotions; to provide you information about or access to your pet’s medical
                                information; to engage with you over features such as product ratings or reviews; to
                                provide you marketing and advertising by email, mail, telephone, text message, push
                                notifications, and across other websites, mobile applications, social media, and online
                                services as appropriate; and to otherwise communicate with you as needed or permitted to
                                run our business.
To deliver personalized advertising and other information we think may be of
                                    interest to you.
For example, we use your personal information – such as your IP address, location, and
                                device identifiers – to help us or our business partners deliver interest-based
                                advertising and content that is tailored to your individual interests. We, or our
                                service providers, partners, vendors, or affiliates, may provide this content via email,
                                mail, telephone, text message, push notifications, and/or across other websites, mobile
                                applications, social media, or online services, as appropriate. We also may use your
                                personal information to enhance and personalize your online shopping experiences, and to
                                recognize or welcome you to the Site or App. In addition, we and our vendors may use
                                your personal information to evaluate your potential eligibility for and interest in
                                special offers, such as Petco Pay. If you choose to participate in a publicly posted or
                                online petition (or similar advocacy activities), we may use your personal information
                                for marketing to and contacting you regarding similar subjects we think may be of
                                interest to you. Please visit Section 5 below (“Digital Tracking Tools & Interest-Based
                                Advertising”) for further information on how to opt out of certain interest-based
                                advertising. California residents may refer to Section 6 (“California Privacy Rights &
                                Reporting”).
To perform business reporting, analysis, and research.
For example, we use information about your transaction history with us, your location,
                                and information about your use of the Services to engage in reporting, analytics, and
                                research that helps us operate or improve our business. This includes metrics measuring
                                the performance of our marketing efforts and advertisements that you may see or receive.
                                To assess our business and marketing performance, we and our vendors also may combine,
                                supplement, and update the personal information we collect from and about you, with
                                information collected offline, across other computers or devices that you may use, and
                                from external sources. We also use your information to better understand who is using
                                the Services; to develop new offerings; and to help us analyze and improve the
                                performance, usage and operations of our Services overall. We use external software
                                providers and tools to help us perform these analytics.
To prevent fraud, comply with applicable law, protect our business, and other purposes.
For example, we may use your name, contact information, IP address, and other personal
                                information to protect the security or integrity of the Services and our business; to
                                prevent fraudulent activity; to investigate potential security incidents; to assist law
                                enforcement; to protect our rights and/or the rights of third parties; and/or to comply
                                with our legal or regulatory obligations. We may also use and share aggregated,
                                anonymized, or de-identified personal information for any legally permissible purpose.

                                acquires our business and/or any of our affiliates, personal information we have
                                collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or
                                reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be
                                considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties.

5. DIGITAL TRACKING TOOLS & INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
Certain parts of our Site and App use cookies and other digital tracking tools to deliver more
                        relevant advertising to you, to perform analytics, and to link data collected across other
                        devices, websites, and apps you may use. These tools help us improve your shopping experiences,
                        deliver personalized advertising, improve our operations, and save you from having to re-enter
                        information each time you visit our Site or App. Some of the tools we use are operated by third
                        parties such as Google Analytics (which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and
                        analyze information to understand the use of our Site and App, and to report on activities and
                        trends). You can learn about Google’s practices
here
,
and you can remove Google Analytics from your browser by installing the Google Analytics
                        browser add-on, available
here
.
In addition, our Site uses third-party tools known as “session replay” technology, which allow
                        us to understand how users interact with our Site. These tools recreate a “replay” of a user’s
                        online experience, including clickstream and other interactions with our content, which we use
                        to debug our Site, perform analyses, and improve our operations. Our digital tracking tools may
                        also collect information regarding your use of other websites, applications, and online
                        resources. We also use third-party advertising networks to serve ads on our behalf on our own
                        Site and App, and on third-party sites and apps. These networks may collect information about
                        your visits to our platforms in order to provide you with ads about goods and services that may
                        be of interest to you. They also may keep track of your interaction with our ads and your visits
                        to our Site and App.
Some browsers or operating systems allow you to adjust your settings to limit certain tracking
                        or to decline cookies. You can refer to your browser’s or operating system’s website or “Help”
                        section for more information on how to delete and/or disable cookies, and options for
                        controlling your tracking preferences. Some browsers offer a “Do-Not-Track” feature. We may not
                        respond to Do-Not-Track requests or headers from some browsers. Please note, you may need to
                        separately disable cookies on each browser and device you use to access the Services. If you
                        choose to opt out of personalized advertising, you will still continue to receive generic

6. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS & REPORTING
If you are a California resident, this section applies to you. The California Consumer Privacy
                        Act (“CCPA”) and the Shine the Light law afford California residents certain rights with respect
                        to their personal information. The CCPA defines “personal information” as any information that
                        identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could
                        reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. The CCPA
                        gives California residents the following rights related to their personal information:
Right to Know:
You have the right to request that we disclose the categories and pieces of personal
                                information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which your
                                personal information was collected, our purpose for collection, and the categories of
                                personal information we disclose and to whom.
Right to Delete:
You have the right to request that we delete your personal information, subject to
                                certain exceptions.
Right to Opt Out of Sales:
You have the right to request that we do not “sell” your personal information to third
                                parties. We share certain personal information with third parties in exchange for
                                valuable consideration, which may meet the CCPA’s definition of “sell.” We “sell”
                                personal information under the CCPA for the commercial purposes of obtaining insights,
                                analytics, marketing services, and for other valuable services provided to us by third
                                parties. These third parties help us enhance your experiences with us, provide more
                                relevant advertising, improve our ability to serve you, and keep you aware of our
                                products, services, and offers. We do not knowingly sell the personal information of
                                minors under the age of 16.
Right to Opt Out of Financial Incentives:
You have the right to opt out of financial incentive programs we may offer, as described
                                below in our Notice of Financial Incentives.
Right to Non-Discrimination:
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy
                                rights. We respect your privacy rights and we do not discriminate against individuals
                                for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
The table in Section 1 summarizes for the preceding 12 months the categories of personal
                        information we have collected; the sources from which we collected this information; the
                        business or commercial purpose for the collection; and the categories of recipients to whom the
                        information was disclosed.
How to Exercise Your Right to Know and Your Right to Delete
If you are a California resident, or an authorized agent acting on behalf of a California
                        resident, and you wish to exercise the Right to Know or the Right to Delete, you may submit a
                        request through our
web form
,
by calling us at (866) 683-1102, or by emailing us at
privacy@petco.com
.
You may submit a Right to Know and/or a Right to Delete request at no charge up to two
                        times every 12 months.
When you submit a Right to Know or Right to Delete request, we will verify your identity by
                        matching the information provided by you with the information we have in our records. In some
                        cases, we may need to request additional information in order to verify your identity, or where
                        necessary to process your request. If we are unable to adequately verify your identity or the
                        legitimacy of your request, we will notify you or the requester. If you fail to timely respond
                        to our request to verify your identity, your request may be denied. Please note that, even if
                        your Right to Delete request is granted, we may retain certain limited personal information
                        where necessary under applicable law, such as to fulfill a contract with you, to comply with
                        other laws, to prevent fraud, for dispute resolution, to protect information security, and to
                        enforce our
Terms of Use
and other agreements.
You may submit a Right to Know or Right to Delete request on your own behalf, or you may
                        designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. If an agent submits a Right to
                        Know or Right to Delete request, the agent must present signed, written authorization to act on
                        your behalf. You will also be required to independently verify your own identity directly with
                        us, and to confirm with us that you provided the agent permission to submit the request. This
                        verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent provides documentation reflecting
                        that the agent has power of attorney to act on your behalf under California Probate Code
                        sections 4121-4130.
How to Exercise Your Right to Opt Out of Sales

                        resident, and you wish to exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sales, please scroll to the bottom of
                        this webpage or our

for assistance. To process your request, our privacy vendor will place a cookie on your browser
                        to automatically prevent the sale of your personal information when you use that browser to
                        visit Petco.com. You will need to submit a separate Opt Out of Sale request on each browser and
                        device that you use to visit Petco.com. Please note that after we process your request, you may
                        still see advertising regarding our products and services. This advertising is designed for a
                        general audience, or it may be delivered by service providers in ways that do not involve sales
                        of your personal information.
Notice of Financial Incentives
We are a member of the Petco Animal Supplies Stores, Inc. family of businesses. As such, our
                        affiliated or related entities offer price discounts, coupons, services and other perks for
                        members of certain loyalty, rewards and subscription-based programs (including but not limited
                        to the Pals Rewards Program); large volume customers; mobile or online customers; repeat
                        customers; members of our mailing lists; and customers who have signed up for Petco-branded
                        credit cards (collectively, “Offers”). To participate in these Offers, you may provide some
                        personal information, such as identifiers and financial information (e.g., name, address, email
                        address, phone number, credit/debit card number, credit history, or qualifications) and in some
                        instances, health and other information about your pets. The details of each Offer are described
                        in the materials outlining that specific Offer. There is no obligation to participate in the
                        Offers, and you may opt out at any time. These Offers are provided to enhance our and Petco’s
                        relationship with you, and so you can enjoy more of the Services and related products at a lower
                        price. We and Petco invest heavily in our marketing and brands, in part, so we can provide such
                        Offers to our customers. The value to our business of any individual’s personal information is
                        dependent on a number of factors, including, for example, whether and to what extent that person
                        takes advantage of any Offers, whether and to what extent they opt out of any Offers, and
                        whether we are able to enhance the data through our efforts. However, customer data is valuable
                        to our businesses only when it is combined with a sufficient number of other data and after it
                        is enhanced by our efforts. Our ability to create any value from the Offers is heavily based on
                        our ability to leverage our intellectual properties and enhance the data. To the extent we
                        create overall value to our business from our Offers that could be directly or reasonably
                        related to the value of customer data, the method for calculating such value would include: (1)
                        the expenses associated with the Offer, including the provision or imposition of any financial
                        incentive or price or service differences, such as our intellectual property, data analytics,
                        and marketing operations; (2) the expenses related to the collection, retention and enhancement
                        of customer’s personal information; and (3) all other expenses reasonably related to the
                        programs. We make the preceding good faith estimate only for California residents and for the
                        limited purpose of complying with the CCPA. You can opt into, or opt out of, these Offers at any
                        time by contacting us using one of the methods listed in Section 15 below (“Contact Us”).

9. DATA SECURITY
We have taken certain physical, administrative, and technical steps designed to safeguard the

                        despite these measures, no e-commerce platform, website, application, or system is 100% secure.
                        You should take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized
                        access to your password, phone, and computer by, for example, signing off after using a shared
                        computer; choosing a unique password for each account that no one else knows or can easily
                        guess; and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost,
                        stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password
                        activity.
10. TRANSFER OF DATA FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
We are located in the United States, and therefore collect, process, and store your information
                        in the United States. If you use any of our Services from outside of the United States, personal
                        information that we collect from or about you will be transferred to and stored on servers
                        inside the United States. Your use of the Services or provision of information to us constitutes
                        your consent to the collection, transfer, use, processing, sharing, and storage of your
                        information in the United States.
11. CHILDREN
Our Services are directed at a general audience and are not targeted to children. We do not
                        knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected
                        personal information from an individual under age 16, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly
                        remove such information. If you believe that we may have information from a child, please
                        contact us at

.
12. EXTERNAL CONTENT, LINKS, AND PLUG-INS
The Services may have links to external websites or applications, which may have privacy
                        policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such third
                        parties. The Services may also offer you the ability to interact with social plug-ins from
                        external social media sites, which may allow us and/or the social media site to receive personal
                        information from or about you. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social media
                        plug-in, such as a Facebook “Like” or Twitter “Follow” button, and we may receive other
                        information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personal
                        information to an external party operating a plug-in on the Site or App, then such external
                        party may recognize you on our platform. Your use of social network plug-ins is subject to each
                        social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from ours, so please read these
                        policies carefully. As with linked sites, we have no control over the information that is
                        collected, stored, or used by social network plug-ins, and we are not responsible for the
                        practices of such sites.
13. PUBLIC FORUMS
Any personal information you choose to disclose on public blogs, discussion or message boards,
                        in chat rooms, interactive forums, ratings or reviews, on other external websites that we may
                        link to, or on other public areas on the Site or App, becomes public information. Please
                        exercise caution when disclosing personal or other information in public areas. We are not
                        responsible for the personal information you choose to post in a public forum. To request
                        removal of your personal information from our Site or App, you may contact us using one of the
                        methods listed in the “Contact Us” section below.
14. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

                        post the changes on the Site or App. Please visit this page periodically so that you will be
                        apprised of any such changes. If we change the Privacy Policy in a material way, we will provide
                        appropriate notice to you.
