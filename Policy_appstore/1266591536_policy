What does this Privacy Notice
tell you?
This
Privacy Notice (“Notice”) provides necessary information required by the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) on how adidas (“adidas”, “we”,
“us”) collects and uses information about you that is provided by you directly
and indirectly or others. When the information allows us to identify you as an
individual independent from others, it’s called “personal data” under the
GDPR.
Additionally,
you should also read any privacy notices displayed when you provide personal
data to us as they provide details of the specific scenario which may not be
covered by this Notice.
If
you access any of our platforms by using a Virtual Private Network (also known
as “VPN”) to interact with us – including making purchases - in a country that
is not your current or residential country where GDPR is the governing privacy
law, please read the privacy notice displayed at that specific platform or
portal to understand how the responsible entities, our affiliated brands and
adidas subsidiaries at that country use and protect your Personal Data as local
national requirements may be different from the GDPR.
We
will routinely review the content of this Notice and make minor adjustments and
corrections as necessary. As required by law, when we make any significant
changes that would have an impact on your rights and your Personal Data, we
will announce these changes in advance, and make sure you are informed of these
changes, which may require us to send you an email announcement.

We understand that there are tools, apps, solutions, and websites operated by

on the design of these tools, we may need to contact you directly still to
verify your identity before we can process your requests via 3

solutions. We can’t process your request unless we have verified your identity
and have no concern that you are the person who the personal data actually
identifies. We can’t and don’t upload any files to 3
rd
-party portals
as that is a serious data security risk to adidas systems and infrastructure,
and it could consequently lead to a significant data breach incident.
Therefore, even
when you made a request using a 3
rd
-party tool, we may still request
that you use our automated solution or contact our customer service by
following the instructions above for our
website
or
adidas apps
in
order to verify your identity, and ensure your request is processed in a timely
and secure manner.

understand what these rights mean.

We use
“Marketing Cookies” provided by our advertising partners to make sure our
advertising messages are shown to you at the right time and the right place.

Cookies to limit the number of times a user sees a particular ad on a website
and to measure the effectiveness of a particular campaign. The identifier
stored by these Cookies are provided by our partners. We cannot use the same
identifier in our own systems.
Specifically,
they allow us to do the following:
§
3rd-Party Advertising
the technology is used to share your data
collected with third-party (non-adidas) advertising platforms and

a site external to the destination website.
§

(“RTB”).
§
Cross Device Tracking
We use Google Analytics to collect consumer
device data, and related web browsing behaviour across devices (e.g. mobile
phone / tablet / computer) wherever you can be identified with the same

consumers who browse products on our site from a phone, and later return to
complete purchases from a tablet or laptop. We do so to improve the
effectiveness of our different marketing channels.

was used for the login within an access token. The access token is a HTTP only
cookie. The token is valid for 20 minutes if the ‘keep me logged in’
functionality was selected. After the expiration of the token it is no longer
possible to access personal information so the logged in session is over. For
persistent login we additionally store a refresh token in the browser which can
be used to refresh the access token within a 30 days period and extend the
logged in session that way. If this refresh token is missing (if you have not
selected persistent login or cookies were cleared) the access token cannot be
refreshed. Hence, your session cannot be extended, and you will not be logged

Infinite Play Programme Resell
Participation
PROCESSING
adidas
has partnered with our Selling Partner - Stuffstr Limited (“Stuffstr”) - to
provide consumers the opportunity to sell back eligible adidas products in
return for adidas gift cards through the adidas Infinite Play resell Programme
(“the Programme”).
For
the Programme, we will need to use the following information:
Contact Information – so Stuffstr knows where
to pick up your items, send you bags to pack your items, and to issue gift
cards to the right person, and you will receive adidas Gift Cards via email or
in-app messages;
Payment, Purchase and Transaction
Information – as gift cards are issued based on the length of the item
purchased, we need to verify when you actually bought the items; and
Membership Administration Information – you
get points when you resell your items according to adiClub Terms and
Conditions.
Stuffstr
will conclude the contract with you directly, so they can collect the items
from you, sell the products for recycling, and provide you with gift cards in
return. If you need more bags for the items you wish to resell, you will be
redirected to the Stuffstr website to provide additional information.
Profiling:
Stuffstr staff will be manually assessing the status of the items you resell
and create a profile for the items you have resold through the Programme.
Stuffstr uses this information to determine their future assessment for your
items. If you have consistently returned items that are more worn out than
expected (the original return price), Stuffstr may provide a different value
based on your profile.
Labels
Scanning: you have the option to use your device camera to scan the labels of
the adidas products you want to sell back to us. We will use the labels
pictures to recognize information about the product (size, materials, model,
production date) and to identify whether the product is genuine or not.
To
analyse the labels we use the Google Machine Learning Kit
(https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning). Your label
pictures will not be shared with Google.
We
will ask for your permission before you use your camera to try this feature.

Push Notification on Mobile
Devices Based on Your Current Location
PROCESSING
We
need to access your real time location information via your mobile devices in
order to send you push notifications about an event or an adidas store closest
to you.
When
you enable location sharing for the adidas app, including when you’re not using
the app, or when the app is closed, you allow the adidas app to continue to
access your mobile device’s location data in the background.
adidas
sets up a “geofence” around a specific location of interest, such as a store or
an event. This geofence is registered with the location service available on
your mobile device, such as Google or Apple. We do not receive information
about your actual location in real time. We only receive information from the
location services about your mobile device entering and leaving our geofences.
Android
Device and Google location service
: We checks every 15 minutes to see whether a device is close to one
of our geofences. We store a cache on your device to capture the location from
which the request was made so that we can invalidate the cache stored on your
device when you move away.
Apple
Device and location service
: adidas is notified every time a user moves more than about 500m
so we can re-register the regions in order of proximity to users (to get around
the limit of 20 regions). We store your last known location temporarily. The
information is discarded when the app is closed.
