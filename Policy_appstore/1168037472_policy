a. We and our third party service providers, which include ad networks, use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Platform and Services, such as your browser type, your ISP or operating system, your domain name, your access time, the URL of the previous website you visited, your page views, your IP address, and the type of device that you use. We also track how frequently you visit our Platform and use our Services. We use this information (including the information collected by our third party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to determine which portions of our Platform are used most frequently, what our users like/do not like), to assist us in determining relevant advertising (both on and off our Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this policy. Currently, we do not honor browser requests not to be tracked.
b. Geo-location Information – IP address of the User’s device or mobile device’s GPS (to offer an improved User’s experience) - most mobile devices allow the User to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu. PetBacker may also collect this information even when the User is not using the Platform if this connection is enabled through the settings or device permissions;
c. Usage Information – information about the User’s interaction with the Platform such as the pages or content the User views, the User’s searches for listings, bookings the User have made and other actions on the Platform;

Log Data and Device Information - log data and device information such as details about how a person has used the Platform, IP address of the used device, browser type or the webpage software information a person has visited before coming to the Platform, access dates and times, hardware and software information, device event information, unique identifiers and Cookies data (collected when a person accesses and uses the Platform even without creating an Account or log in) – this information is used to verify that visitors of the Platform meet the criteria required to process their requests.
e. Cookies. We and our third party service providers collect information from you by using cookies. A cookie is a small file stored on user's computer hard drive containing information about the user. The cookie helps us analyze web traffic or informs you about your use of a particular website. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual, tailoring its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. When you visit the Platform, we may send one or more cookies (i.e., a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer that identifies your browser.
Some of these cookies may be connected to third-party companies or websites. The terms of use of such cookies are governed by this Policy and the privacy policy of the relevant thirdparty company or website. For example, Google measures the performance of advertisements by placing cookies on your computer when you click on ads. If you visit the Platform when you have such cookies on your computer, we and Google will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. The terms of use of these cookies are governed by this Policy and Google's Privacy Policy.
Disabling Cookies. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Platform because it may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
f. Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Platform to, among other things, track the activities of Platform visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

To do so, the user must provide his or her email address, as well as the email address of the recipient. The user's email address is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.
3. POLLING
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues, Services, and/or the Platform. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user.

D. Children's Privacy
Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.

PetBacker may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. PetBacker is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.

We may share the information that we collect about you, including your personal information, as follows:

Interested bidders, however, will be able to click on your request on such third party site, and will be directed to our Platform where they will have access to your first name and the first letter of your last name, as would any other service provider on our Platform interested in bidding on your request.
4. DISCLOSURE TO OTHER USERS OF OUR PLATFORM

In the event that PetBacker undergoes a change in control, including, without limitation, a merger or sale of all or substantially all of PetBacker's assets to which this Platform relates or other corporate reorganization in which PetBacker participates, and is thus merged with or acquired by a third party entity (a "Successor"), PetBacker hereby reserves the right to transfer the information we have collected from the users of the Platform and/or Services to such Successor.
In addition, in the event of PetBacker's bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application or laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, PetBacker may not be able to control how your information is transferred, used, or treated and reserves the right to transfer the information we have collected from the users of the Platform and/or Services to non-affiliated third parties in such event.
7. INFORMATION DISCLOSED AT YOUR REQUEST
We may share your personal information with other Registered Users to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information or if you explicitly consent to such disclosure upon receipt of a specific Service.

G. Links to External Websites
The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which PetBacker does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by PetBacker of those external websites.

You can review, correct and delete your personal information by logging into the Platform and navigating to edit profile page in "My Profile" You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless, upon your request we will close your Account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that once you publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you agree that PetBacker shall not be responsible for any personal information that was not included within your deleted and/or removed Account that remains on the Platform.
I. What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?
We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your Account or any Services you have requested or received from us.
J. Third-Party Ad Networks
We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements on other websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.
K. Your Full Name and Use of PetBacker Information
1. YOUR FULL NAME
As a Registered User of the Platform you will select a Full Name during the registration process. All of your activities on the Platform will be traceable to your Full Name. Certain other people, including other Registered Users with whom you have transacted business via the Platform, can see a large part of your activity on the Platform. If you book a service with a Registered User, cancel a scheduled service with a Registered User, receive an offer on your posted service from a Registered User, or have posted a service, PetBacker may send a notice to you or the appropriate Registered User that includes your Full Name. Thus, if you associate your real name with your Full Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name may be able to personally identify your Platform activities.
2. USING INFORMATION FROM PETBACKER
The Platform facilitates your sharing of personal information with others in order to negotiate, provide, and use the Services. If you agree to contract for a service with another Registered User, you may need to reveal your name, email, phone number, or personal address to that individual so that the service may be performed.

You agree to use the information of other users solely for the following purposes: (a) PetBacker-transaction-related purposes; and (b) using Services offered through the Platform.
3. ACCOUNT PROTECTION
Your password is the key to your Account. When creating your password you should use unique numbers, letters, special characters, and combinations thereof. In addition, DO NOT disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, you are solely responsible for all actions taken via your Account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Thus, IF YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN COMPROMISED FOR ANY REASON, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY petbacker TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.
L. User Generated Content
We invite you to post content on our Platform, including your comments, feedback, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Platform.

YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS PLATFORM AND/OR CONTINUED PROVISION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE THEN-CURRENT POLICY.
N. Notice to Non-United States Users
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States with Disaster Recovery in United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. If you create an Account with the Platform as a visitor from outside United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Policy.
O. Legal information and how to contact us
Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) we have to say who the ‘controller’ is for services provided through our sites. The controller is the department responsible for protecting information and, in our case, is the PetBacker Data Protection Team, by emailing us at
