Your Information
Protected Health Information (PHI)
This notice describes how we use, disclose, and protect certain health information called “protected health information” or “PHI.”
Your PHI includes:
demographic information we collect (such as your name, date of birth, mailing or email address); or
unique numbers or other information that may identify you (such as your social security number, your phone number, your driver’s license number, photographs); combined with
information about your health or indicating that you are our patient or receiving other health-related services from us.
Your PHI may be included in many formats, including in paper records, in photographs and radiology imaging taken as part of your care, and in other electronic formats such as our electronic health record and other systems.
The federal health privacy law described in this notice does not protect the health information of people who died more than 50 years ago. But if other laws require us to protect this health information, we will continue to protect it.
Your Rights
When it comes to your protected health information, you have certain rights.
This section explains your rights and some of our responsibilities.
Get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record
You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and certain other health information we have about you. We will give you a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days of your request. We may charge a reasonable fee based on our costs. Please contact our Health Information Management department at
646-227-2089
for information on how to ask for your records.
For your convenience, we encourage you to use our patient portal, MSK MyChart, to see your health information or to ask for a copy of your records. If you do not yet have a MSK MyChart account, you can register by talking with your healthcare team or visiting
MSKMyChart.mskcc.org
.
MSK maintains the medical record of MMC patients on behalf of MMC. If you are a patient of MMC and ask for your records, they will include both your MMC and MSK records.
We may deny (not give) access to your health information under certain circumstances.  If we deny your request, you have a right to get a formal review of our decision. We will tell you how to do this.
Ask us to correct your medical record
You can ask us to correct or amend health information about you in your medical record that you think is wrong or incomplete. Please contact our Health Information Management department at
646-227-2089
for information on how to make this request.
We may say “no” to all or part of your request. We will tell you why in writing within 60 days.
Ask us to use confidential communication
You can ask us to contact you in a specific way. For example, you can tell us to call your home or office phone, or to send mail to a different address.
We will say “yes” to all reasonable requests.
Ask us to limit what we use or share
You can ask us not to use or share certain PHI for treatment, payment, or our healthcare operations. We are not required to agree to your request. For example, we may say “no” if it would affect your care or our healthcare operations.
If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or our healthcare operations with your health insurer. We will say “yes” unless a law requires us to share that information.
Get a list of how we shared your information
You can ask for a list of the times we’ve shared your PHI. This is called an accounting of disclosures. It will tell you who we shared your information with, and why, during the 6 years before your request.
We are not required to include on this list disclosures about treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. We’re also not required to include some other disclosures, such as those you asked us to make. We will give you 1 accounting every 12 months (1 year) for free. We will charge you a reasonable fee based on our costs if you ask for another one during that period.
To request an accounting of disclosures, please call the Privacy Office at
646-227-2056

www.mskcc.org
or ask for a copy at your next visit.
Choose someone to act for you
If you have given someone medical power of attorney or if someone is your legal guardian, that person can exercise your rights. That means they can ask for access to your PHI and make choices about your PHI.
Before we take any action, we will make sure this person has authority (is allowed) to act for you.

For the situations below, please tell us if you have a preference for how we share your PHI. We will follow your instructions.
Fundraising:
We are allowed to use some of your protection health information for our fundraising efforts and may contact you for fundraising. You can tell us not to contact you again and not to use your PHI for fundraising by calling the Privacy Office at

or emailing at

for more information about our participation in HIEs. To change your HIE choice or to fully opt-out, email
HIEoptout@mskcc.org
or call our Health Information Management department at
646-227-2942
.
Patient Directory, Family, and Friends:
We may also use your PHI in our Patient Directory. We can disclose it from the directory or share it with family and friends involved in your care without your written permission. We always will give you an opportunity to tell us you don’t want to share your PHI for the purposes below. Sometimes, there may not be enough time for that because of a medical emergency. Talk with us about your preferences as soon as the emergency is over. We will follow your wishes, unless the law says we cannot do what you ask.
Patient Directory
.  Unless you tell us not to, our Patient Directory will include information about you while you’re admitted here. It will have your name, religious affiliation, and your location within our building. It also will have your general condition, such as fair, stable, or critical. We will release this directory information, except for your religion, to people who ask for you by name. Your religious affiliation may be shared with a member of the clergy, such as a priest, rabbi, or imam. We may share that information even if they don’t ask for you by name.
Family and Friends Involved in Your Care
.  Unless you tell us not to, we may share your health information with people who support or pay for your care. This includes a family member, domestic partner, or other close friend. We also may share other information with a family member, personal representative, or other support person responsible for your care. We may share information about your location and general condition while you’re in the hospital, including news about a death. Sometimes we may need to share your information with a disaster relief group that will help us notify these people.
In these cases, we will not share your PHI unless you give us written permission:
Certain marketing activities.
Sale of your PHI.
Most sharing of “psychotherapy notes,” if we maintain any. Under federal law, “Psychotherapy notes” are notes that may be kept by a mental health professional and are maintained separately from the rest of your medical record. If a mental health provider maintains these separate notes, we will not share them without your written permission. However, notes documented by your mental health provider within your medical record will be treated like other PHI in your record, as described in this notice.
Our Uses and Disclosures
How do we typically use or share your health information?
We do not need your written permission to use, share, or disclose your PHI for these common purposes:
To treat you
We can use your health information and share it with other healthcare providers who are treating you.
Example:
An MSK doctor may share your health information with another MSK doctor, or with a non-MSK doctor, to diagnose or treat you.
To run our organization
We can use and share your PHI to run our healthcare locations and to improve the care we provide. We can use it to contact you when necessary. We may also share your PHI with certain vendors, called business associates, who help us run our organization. We will have a written contract with these business associates that makes sure they also protect the privacy of your information.
Example:
We use health information about you to manage the services we provide. We use it to evaluate the performance of our staff who care for you.
To bill for services
We can use and share your health information to bill and get payment from health plans or others that pay for your care.
Example:
We give information about you to your health insurance plan so it will pay for your services.
How else can we use or share your PHI?
We are allowed or required to share your PHI in the ways described below. Most often, they contribute to the public good, such as public health and research. The law makes us meet many conditions before we can share your information for the following purposes:
To help with public health and safety issues
We can share your PHI, including with public health authorities, in certain situations such as:
Preventing disease.
Helping with product recalls.
Reporting adverse reactions to medications.
Reporting suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.
Preventing or reducing a serious threat to anyone’s health or safety.
To do research
We can use or share your protected health information for health research under certain conditions. All MSK research is approved through a special review process to protect patient safety, welfare (well-being), and confidentiality (privacy). In most cases, we will ask for your written permission before using or sharing your PHI to do our research. However, there are times when we’re allowed to use your PHI for our research without your authorization (permission). This happens only if we get approval from a special review board.  These research studies don’t affect your treatment or welfare, and we will continue to protect your privacy.  We can do some research using de-identified health information, which is health information that does not identify a person. We can use or share de-identified health information without your authorization.
To comply with (obey) the law
We will share PHI about you if state or federal laws require it. For example, if the Department of Health and Human Services wants to see that we’re complying with federal privacy laws.
To respond to requests for organ and tissue donation
We can share PHI about you with organ procurement organizations. These are groups involved with organ, eye, or tissue donation or transplantation.
To work with a medical examiner or funeral director
We can share PHI with a coroner, medical examiner, or funeral director when someone dies.
To address workers’ compensation, law enforcement, and other government requests
We can use or share certain PHI about you:
For workers’ compensation claims.
For law enforcement purposes or with a law enforcement official.
With health oversight agencies for activities authorized (allowed) by law.
For special government purposes, such as military, national security, and presidential protective services.
To respond to lawsuits and legal actions
We can share PHI about you in response to a court or administrative order. We can also share it in response to a subpoena if it meets certain requirements (rules).
Our Responsibilities
By law, we must take steps to keep your PHI private and secure.
We will tell you as soon as possible, and always within 60 days, if a breach occurs that may have compromised the privacy or security of your PHI.
We must give you a copy of this notice and follow the duties and privacy practices the notice describes.
We will not use or share your PHI other than as described here unless you tell us we can in writing. Even if you give us your written approval, you can change your mind at any time by telling us in writing.
Genetic, HIV, Alcohol and Substance Abuse, and Mental Health Information.
We follow Federal rules about privacy. We also follow New York State laws about health care privacy, and other state laws if they apply to us. We will get any consents required by applicable state laws before we share:
Results of genetic tests performed to identify a predisposition to (likelihood of having) an inherited genetic disease or disability.
Information about your HIV status
Certain information about your substance abuse or mental health
Reproductive Health Information.
As of December 23, 2024, MSK will also comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy (the “Reproductive Privacy Rule”) for so long as and to the extent the rule remains in effect. If MSK receives any request to share PHI that is potentially related to reproductive health care and the request is related to health oversight activities, judicial or administrative proceedings, law enforcement activities, or is for disclosure to a coroner or medical examiners regarding a decedent, MSK will obtain a signed attestation from the requestor.  The attestation will confirm that the requestor will not use or disclose the PHI for a purpose prohibited under the Reproductive Privacy Rule.
Other Notices
Incidental Disclosures.
We take reasonable steps to keep your PHI private. However, it’s still possible your PHI may be disclosed. Disclosure can happen during allowed PHI uses or disclosures, or as an unavoidable result of them.
Example:
People in the waiting room may overhear your name when you are called in for your appointment.
De-Identified Information.
When health information is completely “de-identified” it’s no longer PHI, and the protections described in this notice no longer apply. De-identified means we have removed any information that could identify you, as required by law. For example, a lab report is de-identified if we keep the test results, but edit it to remove:
Your name
Your date of birth
Your medical record number
All other information that could identify you
Once your information has been de-identified, we may use it for any lawful purpose. This may include using and sharing the de-identified data to develop new tests, procedures, commercial products, or for other commercial purposes.

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose the Personal Data (defined below) that we collect or receive through MSK MyChart. When we say “
MSK MyChart
” we mean collectively:
The MSK MyChart
website
;
The MSK MyChart mobile application (“
App
”);
The MSK MyChart Bedside
website
and mobile application (together, “
MSK MyChart Bedside
”); and
Any other webpages or mobile applications that link to this Privacy Policy.
MSK MyChart is made available to MSK Patients or any Proxy account users (defined below) designated by an MSK Patient, as well as to users of certain Other Applications (defined below) that link to or use MSK MyChart as an identity verification solution.  MSK MyChart is also offered as a service to Patients of Memorial Medical Care, P.C. (“
MMC
”) and any Proxy account users they designate.  Any information collected from MSK or MMC Patients or Proxy account users through MSK MyChart will be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  All users of MSK MyChart described above are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “
users
”.
Back to top
Patient medical records include patient health information known as Protected Health Information (“
PHI
”), which is regulated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). PHI includes certain information that is (a) created or received by a health care provider and relates to an individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, health care provided to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for health care provided to an individual; and (b) that identifies the individual or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.  Please review our
Notice of Privacy Practices
(HIPAA)
for information on how we may use and disclose your PHI.
When we use the term “
Personal Data
” we mean information that we directly associate with a specific person, or that we can reasonably use to identify a specific person such as a name or email address.  Any Personal Data we collect through MSK MyChart that is also PHI will be
handled as further described in our Notice of Privacy Practices (HIPAA). We collect and use Personal Data and PHI through your use of MSK MyChart in the following ways:
1. Personal Data You Provide to Us
We collect Personal Data when you choose to share that information with us, including in the following ways.
All MSK MyChart Users:
When you set up an MSK MyChart account, you will be asked to submit Personal Data which could include your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, date of birth, legal sex, and social security number.  We use this information to set up and administer your MSK MyChart account.
We may collect information and use it to manage how we communicate with you. For example, we may use your email address to alert you that you have a message waiting in MSK MyChart.
Patient Users:
If you are a registered MSK or MMC patient (“
Patient
”) setting up your MSK MyChart account, you may also be asked to provide other Personal Data such as your enrollment ID number, medical record number, and emergency contact information.
Patients may choose to invite other people to access their MSK MyChart account.  This is called a “
Proxy account
”.  As a Patient, if you invite someone to set up a Proxy account, you can decide to give the Proxy user full access to your MSK MyChart, or you can limit their access to either clinical access only or scheduling/messaging access only. You can learn more about these access options in MSK MyChart. You can change your mind at any time. When you invite a user to create a Proxy account, you may be asked to provide other Personal Data such as the Proxy account user’s name and email address.
Proxy Account Users:
If you are registering for a Proxy account, when you set up an MSK MyChart account, you will be asked to provide Personal Data about yourself, including your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, date of birth, legal sex, and social security number. You may also be asked to provide other Personal Data such as the Patient’s name, date of birth, legal sex, Patient’s relationship to you. If you were not invited by a Patient to create a Proxy account, you may request a Proxy account subject to the consent or approval of the Patient or MSK, as required by law.
Patient and Proxy Account Users
When a Patient or Proxy account user sends a message to the Patient’s health care providers or other MSK staff through MSK MyChart, we collect the content of the message and the metadata associated with the message. We use this information to respond to your messages and to manage the Patient’s care.
When a Patient or Proxy account user books appointments for the Patient through MSK MyChart, we collect information about the Patient’s contact information, health care professional and appointment confirmation, which we use to facilitate scheduling the appointment and to send appointment reminders.
When a Patient or Proxy account user orders prescription refills through MSK MyChart we collect information about the Patient’s medication, contact information and preferred pharmacy, which we use to facilitate the prescription renewal request.
When a Patient or Proxy account user pays medical bills through MSK MyChart we will collect payment card information, billing information, and contact information, which we use to fulfill your payment, complete your transaction and deliver an invoice to you.
Patients admitted to MSK for inpatient care and their authorized Proxy account users may be granted access to MSK MyChart Bedside, a specialized portal with additional features and functions related to an in-patient stay, such as real-time access to information on the Patient’s lab test results, medications, and treatment plans.  MSK MyChart Bedside users may also order meals, play games, or send messages to the Patient’s healthcare providers while they are in the hospital. When a Patient or Proxy account user uses MSK MyChart Bedside, we collect information about the Patient’s health, dietary preferences, medications, test results, and the content of any messages users send to the Patient’s health care providers and any metadata associated with the messages.   We use this information to provide you the services available through MSK MyChart Bedside, to respond to your messages and to manage the Patient’s care.
Users Accessing MSK MyChart to Sign into Other Applications:
MSK allows users to access certain other applications outside of MSK MyChart (“
Other Applications
”), which may be owned by MSK or a third party.  MSK uses MSK MyChart to verify your identity and connect you to those Other Applications. For example, you may be asked to use MSK MyChart to verify your identity if you use an Other Application as part of an MSK research study or use the MSK Remote Monitoring Application to connect to a wearable device such as a fitness tracker or heart rate monitor.
If you use MSK MyChart to register for or access an Other Application, MSK will use the information you provide to create your MSK MyChart account, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, date of birth, legal sex, and social security number, to verify your identity and connect you to the Other Application.
Some Other Applications may be governed by their own terms and conditions and may collect and use Personal Data differently from MSK MyChart.  You may be required to accept or acknowledge the Other Application’s terms of use and privacy policy.
2. Information We Collect Automatically
We use certain technologies on MSK MyChart to automatically collect information during your use of MSK MyChart (“
Other Information
”).  If we associate Other Information with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose Personal Data collected through MSK MyChart as described in the sections above, for the reason(s) provided to you at the time we collect it, with your authorization or consent, and in the following ways:
Patients and Proxy Account Users
. If a Patient chooses to give other people access to their MSK MyChart account as Proxy account users, the Proxy account users can, depending on their access permissions as selected by the Patient, view certain parts of the Patient’s medical record that are available through MSK MyChart, such as the Patient’s treatment, test results, diagnostic and billing information, as well as other information available in the Patient’s MSK MyChart account.
Third-Party Service Providers
.
We may disclose Personal Data to vendors who perform services on our behalf, including, but not limited to helping us manage MSK MyChart and your medical records, manage our communication channels and conduct analytics, providers involved in hosting and monitoring MSK MyChart, payment processors, and pharmacy providers.  Vendors with whom we share your Personal Information that is PHI are called business associates.  We will have a written contract with these business associates that makes sure they also protect the privacy of your Personal Information.

Affiliates.
We may disclose Personal Data between and among MSK and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.  For example, MSK and MMC participate in an Organized Health Care Arrangement (OHCA), which allows MSK and MMC to share Personal Data collected in MSK MyChart with each other to carry out treatment, payment, and joint health care operations activities that relate to the OHCA.
Legal Process, Safety and Terms Enforcement.

Business Transfers.
We may disclose Personal Data as a part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution, joint venture or financing, bankruptcy or sale of all or a portion of our assets.

We seek to use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect Personal Data within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

MSK MyChart may contain links to websites or mobile applications owned and operated by third parties.  Other websites may also reference or link to our MSK MyChart. These other web sites are not controlled by MSK. A link to a third party’s website or mobile application does not imply an endorsement of that website’s or mobile application’s content or services.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of third-party websites or mobile applications that are not owned by us.  We encourage you to read privacy statements of any third-party websites or mobile applications to learn about their information practices.

Some web browsers have “Do Not Track” or similar features that allow you to tell each website you visit that you do not want your activities on that website tracked. At present, MSK MyChart does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals and consequently, MSK MyChart will continue to collect information about you even if your browser’s “Do Not Track” feature is activated.

1. Notice to Individuals Located in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area, and Switzerland
This Privacy Policy describes ways in which you may provide information to MSK using MSK MyChart.  Personal Data about individuals located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland (generally referred to here as the “
EU
”) are subject to special protections under EU law when the processing of those data are within the scope of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679), its incorporation into the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland by virtue of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and/or the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, as applicable (together, the “
GDPR
”).  This Notice to Individuals Located in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area, and Switzerland (the “
GDPR MSK MyChart Notice
”) applies to MSK’s processing of Personal Data that is within the scope of the GDPR, which we call collectively the “
GDPR Processing Activities
.”  This GDPR MSK MyChart Notice applies only to GDPR Processing Activities involving Personal Data collected through MSK MyChart.  When you use MSK MyChart to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in the United States for GDPR Processing Activities, MSK is a controller of this Personal Data.
Please be aware that if you use MSK MyChart to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in order to seek care at an MSK facility or a second opinion at MSK, you will be provided a copy of our GDPR Patient Notice and our Notice of Privacy Practices (HIPAA), which will govern our use of protected health information.  The GDPR MSK MyChart Notice will not apply to MSK’s use of such information.
We rely on separate and overlapping bases to process your Personal Data lawfully.  MSK will use the Personal Data provided through or collected on MSK MyChart only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.   MSK’s legal bases for processing your Personal Data include providing you with the information or services that you have requested, protecting your vital interests, furthering our legitimate interests, and your consent, if applicable.  When we process special categories of Personal Data, including data concerning your health, our legal bases for processing such data include protecting your vital interests, furnishing a medical diagnosis, performing preventive or occupational medicine or assessment of the working capacity of our workforce, carrying out our obligations under employment or social protection laws, and your consent, if applicable.  Legitimate interests that we rely on in processing your Personal Data include (i) improving and customizing MSK MyChart for you, (ii) understanding how MSK MyChart is being used, (iii) exploring ways to develop and grow our operations, (iv) ensuring the safety and security of MSK MyChart, and (v) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks.  Without the ability to collect and process your Personal Data, MSK would not be able to achieve those interests.  We may also use your Personal Data for purposes, including scientific research if applicable, that are compatible with the purposes for which such data were initially collected.
If our processing is based solely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.
You may withdraw your consent by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.  Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn consent, if we have a legal basis to do so.  For example, we may retain certain information if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping MSK MyChart safe and secure, or if deleting the information would undermine the integrity of a research study in which you are enrolled.
MSK is located in the United States.  When you enter your Personal Data through MSK MyChart, the data is being transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, and could be transferred to, stored and processed in another country outside of the EU.  Please be aware that the appropriate EU government authorities have not found the United States, and possibly other countries to which your Personal Data may be transferred, to provide adequate safeguards for the protection of Personal Data.  However, MSK will take steps to maintain the privacy of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.  If MSK transfers your Personal Data outside the EU, we will do so in reliance on mechanisms recognized under the GDPR.  This includes (i) transferring your Personal Data to countries that appropriate EU government authorities have determined to provide adequate data protection, (ii) obtaining your consent to transfer your Personal Data outside the EU after first informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer, (iii) transferring your information outside the EU if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between you and MSK, including to provide treatment to you, or if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between your physician or other health care provider located in the EU, and the contract was entered into in your interest, (iv) transferring your information outside the EU if necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or (v) transferring your Personal Data outside the EU to protect your vital interests.
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy (for example, if you have an account, for as long as your account is active), subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your Personal Data erased, as discussed in the next paragraph, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.
If your Personal Data is processed for GDPR Processing Activities, you have the right to (1) see Personal Data that MSK holds about you and receive any details required to be provided to you under applicable law, (2) correct or update your Personal Data, if inaccurate, (3) limit collection and use of your Personal Data under certain circumstances (for example, if you think it is inaccurate), (4) receive your Personal Data in an electronic format as required by law, except Personal Data that has been used for public interest purposes or for MSK’s required legal obligations, (5) request deletion of your Personal Data, subject to MSK’s need to keep such data to comply with legal requirements, for purposes of public health or to preserve the integrity of a research study, or to allow MSK to defend itself from legal claims, and (6) file a complaint with a data protection authority (see
this link
).  If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with your Personal Data, see the section “Contact Us” below.
2. Notice to Individuals Located in the People’s Republic of China
Individuals located in the People’s Republic of China are afforded certain protections where the handling of their Personal Data is within the scope of the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “
PIPL
”).
This notice applies to MSK’s processing of Personal Data that is within the scope of the PIPL, and describes how the information that you transmit to MSK via MSK MyChart will be used by MSK. If you travel to the United States to receive treatment, this notice will not apply to the health care information collected or generated about you at MSK. Instead, you will receive a separate notice that describes how such information will be treated by MSK under U.S. federal and state law.
In this notice, Personal Data shall have the same meaning as “Personal Information” under the PIPL.  Personal Data includes information that relates to you, including but not limited to your name, address, and demographic information.  Personal Data also includes “Sensitive Personal Data”, which is Personal Data that is specially protected under the PIPL. Sensitive Personal Data includes but is not limited to information about your past and present medical health, biometric characteristics, religious beliefs, specially-designated status, and your financial accounts, as well as the Personal Data of minors under the age of 14.
MSK is a Handler of your Personal Data for the purposes of the PIPL.
Description of Personal Data Handling
MSK will handle your Personal Data for the following purposes:
To diagnose your condition.
To provide treatment to you and/or a medical opinion to you and/or your health care provider in your country.
To follow-up with you and/or your health care provider in your country before, during, or after your treatment or medical opinion is provided.
To seek payment from you or a third-party (such as an insurance company or national health benefits program) making payment on your behalf.
To comply with MSK’s statutory duties, responsibilities, and obligations, including responding to requests of regulatory agencies.
To establish and defend against legal claims.
To support MSK’s business and institutional interests (for example, conducting quality assurance and improvement activities and managing MSK’s business operations).
To respond to your questions and/or your requests to exercise your rights over your Personal Data as provided by the PIPL.
If you are a Proxy account user, to allow you to register a Proxy account and monitor parts of the medical record of the Patient who granted you access to their MSK MyChart account.
In order to achieve the purpose for which MSK will handle your Personal Data, MSK will handle the following categories of Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data:
Basic personal information, such as your name, date of birth, gender, family relation, address, personal phone number, or email.
Personal identity information, such as your ID number, passport, or resident certificate.
Physiological and health information, including records generated in connection with your medical treatment, such as pathological information, hospitalization records, physician’s instructions, test reports, surgical and anesthesia records, nursing records, medication administration records, drug and food allergy, fertility information, medical history, diagnosis and treatment, family illness history, history of present illness, and history of infection, and personal health information such as weight and height.
Personal property information, such as financial information or insurance information.
Other information, such as emergency contacts.
Employees or contractors of MSK, such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, administrative staff and other members of the MSK workforce, who are involved in your treatment or rendering a medical opinion to you, or who act in furtherance of MSK’s business and institutional interests.
MSK will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this notice, unless a different retention period is required or permitted by law.
In order to achieve the above purposes, MSK will use various handling methods, including by collecting your Personal Data from you, your health care providers, and others involved in your medical treatment through email, secure web forms, physical mail, and/or digital portals designed to facilitate healthcare services.  Once MSK receives your Personal Data, MSK will store your Personal Data in a data center owned by MSK, as well as in platforms owned by MSK or provided by entrusted persons designed to store and/or handle health data, such as an electronic medical record system and radiology imaging platform.
The following types of persons and entities at, or affiliated with, MSK, will handle your Personal Data in order to achieve the purposes outlined in this notice:
Contractors, vendors, collaborating entities and other entrusted persons that provide services to MSK in support of MSK’s medical services to you or in furtherance of MSK’s business and institutional interests.
Sensitive Personal Data
In order to fulfil the purposes of the Personal Data handling described in this notice, it will be necessary for MSK to handle the categories of your Sensitive Personal Data described in the section above. Without handling your Sensitive Personal Data, MSK would not be able to provide you with medical services or operate its business, as your Sensitive Personal Data is required for MSK to perform necessary actions such as diagnosing your medical condition, providing treatment or medical opinions to you, seeking payment for services, or allowing you to exercise your rights provided by the PIPL.
The handling of your Sensitive Personal Data by MSK may influence your rights and interests in various ways, some of which may not be knowable by you or MSK at the time your Personal Data is handled by MSK. However, your rights and interests may be influenced as follows:
You may receive medical services intended to benefit your health and well-being, including a diagnosis, medical opinion, or treatment provided to your or your healthcare provider in your country.
As Sensitive Personal Data is Personal Data that, according to the PIPL, is considered information that may cause harm to your dignity or grave harm to your personal or property security if leaked or illegally used, there is inherently a heightened risk to individuals whenever their Sensitive Personal Data is handled.  However, MSK has various measures in place intended to mitigate or eliminate risks to your Sensitive Personal Data, including but not limited to: information security and access management programs and a staff data privacy training program.
Your Rights Provided in the Law
You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data as provided in the PIPL, including as follows:
You have the right to consult or copy Personal Data that MSK holds about you.
You have the right request that your Personal Data be transferred to another Personal Data Handler. If you make this request, MSK will transfer your Personal Data or provide a channel through which you may transfer your Personal Data.
You have the right to correct or update your Personal Data if it is inaccurate.
You have the right to limit or refuse the collection and use of your Personal Data unless laws or administrative regulations stipulate otherwise.
If information handling is based on your consent, you have the right to rescind consent.
You have the right to request the deletion of your Personal Data.  However, there are limits on your ability to request deletion of your Personal Data. For example, MSK may keep and use some or all of your Personal Data if necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, legal and regulatory obligations related to the maintenance of medical records at MSK), or where the deletion of your Personal Data is technically hard to realize, in which case MSK shall cease handling your Personal Data except for storage and shall take necessary security protective measures.
If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with your Personal Data, see the section “Contact Us” below.

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time.

”).  If we associate Other Information with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data in accordance with this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy.
The technologies we use to collect Personal Data and other information include the following:
Web Log File Data
.  Like most other websites or mobile applications, we collect some basic information automatically about you and store it in log files.  This information may include IP address, browser type, internet service provider, pages you visit from and pages you go to after leaving the Portal, pages you visit on the Portal (
e.g.
, to access articles, videos, forms, and posts from MSK; to sign-up for events organized by MSK; and to communicate with MSK), date and time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information for Portal management and administration, to improve the content, overall performance and user experience on the Portal, for fraud protection and for protecting our rights.
Data from Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies
.  We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to manage the Portal and to collect information about you when you use the Portal.  These technologies help us to recognize you, analyze your use of the Portal and identify solutions for how to make the Portal more useful.  These technologies also allow us to enhance the usability of the Portal by aggregating demographic and statistical data and providing this information to our service providers.
Information for Analytics
.   We use analytics providers to help us track certain information about your activity in the Portal, and to evaluate and measure the use and performance of the Portal.  We may combine this information with other information we have about you to help us improve the Portal and our service to you.
Please see more information on analytics and data collection technologies and the choices you can make in the “Your Online Choices” section of this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy.
3. Additional Uses of Personal Data
In addition to the uses described above, we may, consistent with our other legal obligations, use your Personal Data for the following purposes:
Maintaining, delivering and improving the Portal and our services;
Contacting you to respond to your requests or inquiries and provide support;
Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
Contacting you about programs, products, or services that we believe may be of interest to you, new service announcements, or event invitations;

Terms and Conditions
; and
Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.
We also may use aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Once de-identified and aggregated so that data does not personally identify you (for example, we may aggregate data in order to improve our automation and improve care), it is no longer personal information. Such de-identified or aggregated information which does not identify individuals is not subject to this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy.

Patients and Proxy Users
. If a Patient chooses to give other people access to their Portal account as Proxy users, the Proxy users can view certain parts of the Patient medical record that are available through the Portal, such as the Patient’s treatment, test results, diagnostic and billing information, as well as other information available in the Patient’s Portal account.
Third-Party Service Providers
.
We may disclose Personal Data with vendors who perform services on our behalf, including, but not limited to helping us manage the Portal, manage our communication channels and conduct analytics, providers involved in hosting and monitoring the Portal, payment processors, and pharmacy providers.

Back to top
We seek to use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect Personal Data within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.
Back to top
The Portal may contain links to websites or mobile applications owned and operated by third parties.  Other websites may also reference or link to our Portal. These other web sites are not controlled by MSK. A link to a third party’s website or mobile application does not imply an endorsement of that website’s or mobile application’s content or services.  This MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of third-party websites or mobile applications that are not owned by us.  We encourage you to read privacy statements of any third-party websites or mobile applications to learn about their information practices. Visiting these other websites and mobile applications is at your own risk.

Some web browsers have “Do Not Track” or similar features that allow you to tell each website you visit that you do not want your activities on that website tracked. At present, the Portal does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals and consequently, the Portal will continue to collect information about you even if your browser’s “Do Not Track” feature is activated.
Back to top
This MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy describes ways in which you may provide information to MSK using the Portal.  Personal Data about individuals located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland (generally referred to here as the “EU”) are subject to special protections under EU law when the processing of those data are within the scope of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (“EU GDPR”), its incorporation into the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland by virtue of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and/or the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, as applicable (together, the “GDPR”).  This  Notice to Individuals Located in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area, and Switzerland  (the “GDPR Portal Notice”) applies to MSK’s processing of Personal Data that is within the scope of the GDPR, which we call collectively the “GDPR Processing Activities.”  This GDPR Portal Notice applies only to GDPR Processing Activities involving Personal Data collected through the Portal.  When you use the Portal to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in the United States for GDPR Processing Activities, MSK is a controller of this Personal Data.
Please be aware that if you use the Portal to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in order to seek care at an MSK facility or a second opinion at MSK, you will be provided a copy of our GDPR Patient Notice and our Notice of Privacy Practices (HIPAA), which will govern our use of protected health information.  The GDPR Portal Notice will not apply to MSK’s use of such information.
We rely on separate and overlapping bases to process your Personal Data lawfully.  MSK will use the Personal Data provided through or collected on the Portal only for the purposes described in this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy.   MSK’s legal bases for processing your Personal Data include providing you with the information or services that you have requested, protecting your vital interests, furthering our legitimate interests, and your consent, if applicable.  When we process special categories of Personal Data, including data concerning your health, our legal bases for processing such data include protecting your vital interests, furnishing a medical diagnosis, performing preventive or occupational medicine or assessment of the working capacity of our workforce, carrying out our obligations under employment or social protection laws, and your consent, if applicable.  Legitimate interests that we rely on in processing your Personal Data include (i) improving and customizing the Portal for you, (ii) understanding how the Portal is being used, (iii) exploring ways to develop and grow our operations, (iv) ensuring the safety and security of the Portal, and (v) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks.  Without the ability to collect and process your Personal Data, MSK would not be able to achieve those interests.  We may also use your Personal Data for purposes, including scientific research if applicable, that are compatible with the purposes for which such data were initially collected.
If our processing is based solely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.
You may withdraw your consent by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.  Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn consent, if we have a legal basis to do so.  For example, we may retain certain information if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping the Portal safe and secure, or if deleting the information would undermine the integrity of a research study in which you are enrolled.
MSK is located in the United States.  When you enter your Personal Data through the Portal, the data is being transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, and could be transferred to, stored and processed in another country outside of the EU.  Please be aware that the appropriate EU government authorities have not found the United States, and possibly other countries to which your Personal Data may be transferred, to provide adequate safeguards for the protection of Personal Data.  However, MSK will take steps to maintain the privacy of your Personal Data as described in this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy.  If MSK transfers your Personal Data outside the EU, we will do so in reliance on mechanisms recognized under the GDPR.  This includes (i) transferring your Personal Information to countries that appropriate EU government authorities have determined to provide adequate data protection, (ii) obtaining your consent to transfer your Personal Data outside the EU after first informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer, (iii) transferring your information outside the EU if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between you and MSK, including to provide treatment to you, or if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between your physician or other health care provider located in the EU, and the contract was entered into in your interest, (iv) transferring your information outside the EU if necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or (v) transferring your Personal Data outside the EU to protect your vital interests.
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy (for example, if you have an account, for as long as your account is active), subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your Personal Data erased, as discussed in the next paragraph, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.
If your Personal Data is processed for GDPR Processing Activities, you have the right to (1) see Personal Data that MSK holds about you and receive any details required to be provided to you under applicable law, (2) correct or update your Personal Data, if inaccurate, (3) limit collection and use of your Personal Data under certain circumstances (for example, if you think it is inaccurate), (4) receive your Personal Data in an electronic format as required by law, except Personal Data that has been used for public interest purposes or for MSK’s required legal obligations, (5) request deletion of your Personal Data, subject to MSK’s need to keep such data to comply with legal requirements, for purposes of public health or to preserve the integrity of a research study, or to allow MSK to defend itself from legal claims, and (6) file a complaint with a data protection authority (see
this link
). If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with your Personal Data, see the section “Contact Us” below.
Back to top
We reserve the right to amend this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). Therefore, please check this MyMSK Portal Privacy Policy periodically for updates and to stay informed about our information practices.

Account Information
You may request that we update, correct or delete information about you in the Portal, or close your account at any time by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.  Please note that even if you close your account, we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
Native Applications and Push Notifications on Mobile Device
Some features of our App may require access to certain native applications on your mobile device, such as the camera and photo storage applications (
e.g.,
to take and upload photos and videos). If you decide to use these features, we will ask you for your consent prior to accessing the applications and collecting information. Note that you can revoke your consent at any time by changing the settings on your device.
With your consent, we may send push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device or within our App.
Cookies and Analytics Tools
Most browsers allow you to turn off certain cookies if you do not want your preferences tracked.  However, your cookie feature on your browser must be turned “on” so you can use the Portal. The “help” menu on most internet browsers contains information on how to control cookies, or you can visit

We do not exercise control over third party websites or applications. These sites or applications may place their own cookies or other files on your device or collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the sites or applications you visit.
OUR POLICY TOWARDS CHILDREN
The App is not directed to persons under 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. MSKCC complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations concerning children and the internet. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, or is the subject of any image to which they have not provided consent, he or she should contact the email address set out in the “About” section of the App and be sure to include in the message the name of the minor and identification of the information and/or image
.
If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with their Personal Information, or if the subject of any uploaded media is a minor, and the parent or guardian of such minor notifies us that such minor has submitted his or her Personal Information, or is the subject of any uploaded media, without the parent or guardian’s permission or consent, MSKCC will take reasonable steps to remove that information and content from the App.
YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATIO
N
Submitting Your Personal Information and Unsubscribing.
MSKCC respects your choices about how your Personal Information is used when you register an Account with us or that you provide us for other purposes.  You can opt-out of receiving communications from MSKCC at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any e-mail communication you receive. However, we may still send you updates to our legal notices or Privacy Policy, or correspondence regarding any account you have created with us.
Changing or Deleting Information
.
If you are a registered User of the App, you may access and update or correct the Personal Information you provided to us by e-mailing us at the contact address set out in the “About” section of the App. You may request a correction or removal of your Personal Information, or request that MSKCC no longer solicit you by email or any other means, at any time, by emailing a request to us at the contact address set out in the “About” section the App. To ensure that your request is handled in an effective manner, please provide your exact e-mail address, name, address and/or telephone number(s). If you seek to delete your Account, we will delete the things you have posted, such as your photos, status updates, and direct messages.  Please note that any information that other Users have shared about you, or any information you post or share with other Users, is not part of your Account and will not be deleted when you delete your Account.  If you wish to temporarily suspend your Account without deleting it, you may deactivate your account instead.
Management of Your Content.
When you share information on the App (e.g., by posting content), you can choose the audience who can see what you share.  For example, when you post on the App, you can select the audience for the post, such as a customized group of individuals, all of your connections, or to all Users.  Likewise, when you send a direct message, you can also choose the Users you send content to.  You can manage the content and information you share on the App through the privacy settings page.
Other Users.
The Users you share and communicate with may download or re-share your content with other Users.  When you comment on another User’s port or “like” his or her content, said User can decide the audience who can see your comment, emoticon reaction, or “like.”  Additionally, other Users may use the App to share content about you with the audience they choose (e.g., sharing a photo of you, or information about you that you shared with them).  If you have concerns about another User’s post, please flag the post for MSKCC to review or otherwise notify MSKCC.
App Permissions
. You may be asked to consent to giving the App certain permissions, including allowing it to access to your mobile device’s camera function, to send push notifications about content in the App, and to send push notifications about MSKCC events.  You are not obligated to provide any such permissions, however, deciding not to provide the App with the requested permissions may impact your experience in the App.
SECURITY
We maintain an information security program intended to protect Users’ Personal Information.  However, no information security program is entirely guaranteed to protect against all threats to Personal Information, so it is your responsibility to restrict others from access your Account without your permission.
NOTICE TO INDIVIDUALS LOCATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, OR SWITZERLAND
Personal Information about individuals located in the United Kingdom  (“UK”), Switzerland, or the European Economic Area are subject to special protections under law when the processing of those data are within the scope of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (“EU GDPR”), its incorporation into the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland by virtue of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and/or the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, as applicable (together, the “GDPR”).  This portion of our Privacy Policy (the “GDPR Policy”) applies to Personal Information subject to the GDPR collected through the App (“EEA Processing Activities”).  If we collect or receive information about you, please note that this GDPR Policy applies only where we are a controller of your data, i.e., where the purpose and means of processing your data is determined by us.  When you use the App to transfer your Personal Information to MSKCC in the United States for EEA Processing Activities, MSKCC is a controller of your Personal Information.
We rely on multiple bases to process your Personal Information lawfully.  MSKCC will use the Personal Information provided or collected through the App only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.   MSKCC’s legal bases for processing such Personal Information include furthering our legitimate interests, your consent, and for our performance of a contract with you, if applicable.  When we process special categories of Personal Information, including data concerning your health, our legal bases for processing such data include your explicit consent, collected via the HIPAA Authorization Form you completed or via another means, and/or where the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, if applicable.  Legitimate interests that we rely on in processing your Personal Information include (i) improving and providing the App for your use, (ii) understanding how the App is being used, (iii) exploring ways to develop and grow our operations, (iv) ensuring the safety and security of the App, and (v) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks.  Without the ability to collect and process your Personal Information, MSKCC would not be able to further those interests.  We may also use your Personal Information for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which such data were initially collected.
If our processing is based solely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.  You may withdraw your consent by deleting your Account.  Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Information after you have withdrawn consent, if we have a legal basis to do so.  For example, we may retain certain information if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping the App safe and secure.
If your Personal Information is processed for EEA Processing Activities, you may have certain rights available to you under the GDPR.  However, those rights are not absolute and may not apply or will be subject to exemptions in some cases.  You may exercise your rights by emailing us at
DSR@mskcc.org
and we will aim to respond to your request as required by applicable data protection laws. These rights may include:
Access
: to access and obtain a copy of your Personal Information processed by MSKCC.
Correction
: to correct or update your Personal Information, if inaccurate.
Deletion
: to request that your Personal Information be deleted, subject to any exceptions under applicable law, including MSKCC’s need to keep such data to comply with its legal obligations.
Restriction
: to request a restriction on the processing of your Personal Information subject to certain conditions.
Transfer
: to request to receive your Personal Information which you have provided to MSKCC, and the right to transfer that data to another controller.
Object
: to object to MSKCC’s processing of your Personal Information.
You also have the right to file a complaint with the applicable Data Protection Authority in the jurisdiction where you live or work, or in the place where you think an issue has occurred concerning your Personal Information. You can find contact details for each Data Protection Authority in the EU and UK at
https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm
.
If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Information or rights associated with your Personal Information, see the section “Contact Us” below.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
MSKCC is located in the United States and almost all data we process to manage the App will be transferred to or accessed from the United States.   In addition, we may transfer your Personal Information to, and access your Personal Information from, other countries throughout the world, in order to support our operations and provide services to you.  When we transfer your Personal Information, we do so in compliance with relevant data protection laws to provide adequate measures to safeguard your privacy rights and maintain the security of your Personal Information. If MSKCC transfers your Personal Information outside of the EEA, UK, Switzerland, or another country that requires legal protections for international data transfer, MSKCC will ensure that an adequate level of protection is provided for your Personal Information using one or more of the following means:  (i) transferring your Personal Information to countries that have privacy laws recognized by the relevant authority in the country that we transfer your data from as providing adequate protection of your Personal Information; (ii) entering into written agreements, such as standard contractual clauses or other data transfer agreements, with data exporters or importers that require all parties to protect your Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection law; (iii) obtaining your consent to transfer your Personal Information for specific purposes after informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer; or (iv) in reliance on other transfer mechanisms approved by the competent authorities in the country from which your Personal Information are transferred.
HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, subject to any rights available to you under certain circumstances to have your Personal Information erased or transmitted to a third party, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.
POLICY CHANGES
This Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time.  We will notify you of changes by posting the new version in the App and updating the effective date of the policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how we collect, process, and share your Personal Information. Your continued use of the App following such changes will indicate your acknowledgement and acceptance of the changes.

This Privacy Notice describes how we collect, use, and disclose the Personal Data (defined below) that we collect or receive through the App.
The App is made available to registered patients of MSK and Memorial Medical Care, P.C. enrolled in a remote monitoring program as part of their care (“
Patients
”). The App is also offered as a service to any individual to whom a Patient has granted access to his or her medical record in MSK MyChart, which access rights will extend to the App as well (a “
Proxy
account
”).  Any information collected through the App from Patients or Proxy account users will be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Notice. All users of the App are collectively referred to in this Privacy Notice as “
users
”.
Back to top
Patient medical records include patient health information known as Protected Health Information (“
PHI
”), which is regulated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). PHI includes certain information that is (a) created or received by a health care provider and relates to an individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, health care provided to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for health care provided to an individual; and (b) that identifies the individual or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.  Please review our
Notice of Privacy Practices
(HIPAA)
for information on how we may use and disclose your PHI.
When we use the term “
Personal Data
” we mean information that we directly associate with a specific person, or that we can reasonably use to identify a specific person such as a name or email address.  Any Personal Data we collect through the App that is also PHI will be
handled as further described in our Notice of Privacy Practices (HIPAA). We collect and use Personal Data and PHI through your use of the App in the following ways:
1. Personal Data You Provide to Us
We collect Personal Data when you choose to share that information with us, including in the following ways.
All Users:
Users may access the App through their MSK MyChart portal, or by logging into the App using their MSK MyChart username and password.  When you access and set up your App account through MSK MyChart, we collect your name and your MSK MyChart username.
We may collect information and use it to manage how we communicate with you. For example, we may use your email address to alert you that you have a message waiting in the App.
When you send a message to health care providers or other MSK staff through the App, we collect the content of the message and the metadata associated with the message. We use this information to respond to your messages and to manage your care.
Patient Users:
Remote monitoring devices issued to you or approved as part of your care, such as a carbon dioxide or blood pressure monitor, or a fitness tracker, will appear in your App account (“
Monitoring Devices
”).  You may also connect mobile health applications selected by your care team, such as iHealth MyVitals or Omron Connect (“
Mobile App Integrations
”).  Once connected, we will collect data from these Monitoring Devices and Mobile App Integrations which will be used to give us more information about your health. In addition, certain App users may be asked for permission to collect location data and to connect to nearby devices. MSK will use such permissions for the sole purpose of connecting to Monitoring Devices and enable Mobile App Integrations, and all such location and connection data will remain on your mobile device and not be sent to or collected by MSK.
We may collect your street address and contact information to confirm the information given to your care team is correct and to manage the delivery of one or more Monitoring Devices to you.
2. Information We Collect Automatically
We use certain technologies in the App to automatically collect information during your use of the App (“
Other Information
”).  If we associate Other Information with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
The technologies we use to collect Personal Data and other information include the following:
Web Log File Data
.  Like most other mobile applications, we collect some basic information automatically about you and store it in log files.  This information may include IP address, internet service provider, pages you visit from and pages you go to after leaving the App, pages you visit on the App (
e.g.
, to access articles, and other materials from MSK; and to communicate with MSK), date and time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information for the management and administration of the App, to improve the content, overall performance and user experience on the App, for fraud protection and for protecting our rights.
Data from Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies
.  We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to manage the App and to collect information about you when you use the App.  These technologies help us to recognize you, analyze your use of the App and identify solutions for how to make the App more useful.  These technologies also allow us to enhance the usability of the App by aggregating demographic and statistical data and providing this information to our service providers.
Information for Analytics
.   We use analytics providers to help us track certain information about your activity in the App, and to evaluate and measure the use and performance of the App.  We may combine this information with other information we have about you to help us improve the App and our service to you.
Please see more information on analytics and data collection technologies and the choices you can make in the “Your Online Choices” section of this Privacy Notice.
3. Additional Uses of Personal Data
In addition to the uses described above, we may, consistent with our other legal obligations, use your Personal Data for the following purposes:
Maintaining, delivering and improving the App and our services;
Contacting you to respond to your requests or inquiries and provide support;
Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
Developing new resources and services;
Conducting, managing and growing our business operations;

Terms and Conditions
[RA3]
; and
Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.
We also may use aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Once de-identified and aggregated so that data does not personally identify you (for example, we may aggregate data to improve our automation and improve care), it is no longer Personal Data. Such de-identified or aggregated information which does not identify individuals is not subject to this Privacy Notice.
Back to top
We may disclose Personal Data collected through the App as described in the sections above, for the reason(s) provided to you at the time we collect it, with your authorization or consent, as permitted by law, and in the following ways:
Patients and Proxy Users
. Proxy users can view information about the Patient’s Monitoring Devices and Mobile App Integrations and the data collected by those Monitoring Devices and Mobile App Integrations.
Third-Party Service Providers
.
We may disclose Personal Data to vendors who perform services on our behalf, including, but not limited to helping us manage the App, your medical records, and your health care, facilitate single sign-on into the App, manage our communication channels and conduct analytics, and providers involved in hosting and monitoring the App.
Affiliates.
We may disclose Personal Data between and among MSK and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.
Legal Process, Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose your Personal Data to legal or government regulatory authorities in response to a search warrant, subpoena, court order or other request for such information or to assist in investigations.  We may also disclose your Personal Data to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise required by law, if we determine such disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of us or our users or to enforce our legal rights or contractual commitments that users have made.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose Personal Data as a part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution, joint venture or financing, bankruptcy or sale of all or a portion of our assets.
Back to top
We seek to use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect Personal Data within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.
Links to Other Websites or Mobile Applications
The App may contain links to websites or mobile applications owned and operated by third parties.  Other websites may also reference or link to our App. These other web sites are not controlled by MSK. A link to a third party’s website or mobile application does not imply an endorsement of that website’s or mobile application’s content or services.  This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of third-party websites or mobile applications that are not owned by us.  We encourage you to read privacy statements of any third-party websites or mobile applications to learn about their information practices. Visiting these other websites and mobile applications is at your own risk.

We rely on separate and overlapping bases to process your Personal Data lawfully.  MSK will use the Personal Data provided through or collected on the App only for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.   MSK’s legal bases for processing your Personal Data include providing you with the information or services that you have requested, protecting your vital interests, furthering our legitimate interests, and your consent, if applicable.  When we process special categories of Personal Data, including data concerning your health, our legal bases for processing such data include protecting your vital interests, furnishing a medical diagnosis, performing preventive or occupational medicine or assessment of the working capacity of our workforce, carrying out our obligations under employment or social protection laws, and your consent, if applicable.  Legitimate interests that we rely on in processing your Personal Data include (i) improving and customizing the App for you, (ii) understanding how the App is being used, (iii) exploring ways to develop and grow our operations, (iv) ensuring the safety and security of the App, and (v) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks.  Without the ability to collect and process your Personal Data, MSK would not be able to achieve those interests.  We may also use your Personal Data for purposes, including scientific research if applicable, that are compatible with the purposes for which such data were initially collected.
If our processing is based solely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.
You may withdraw your consent by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.  Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn consent, if we have a legal basis to do so.  For example, we may retain certain information if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping the App safe and secure, or if deleting the information would undermine the integrity of a research study in which you are enrolled.
MSK is located in the United States.  When you enter your Personal Data through the App, the data is being transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, and could be transferred to, stored and processed in another country outside of the EU.  Please be aware that the appropriate EU government authorities have not found the United States, and possibly other countries to which your Personal Data may be transferred, to provide adequate safeguards for the protection of Personal Data.  However, MSK will take steps to maintain the privacy of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Notice.  If MSK transfers your Personal Data outside the EU, we will do so in reliance on mechanisms recognized under the GDPR.  This includes (i) transferring your Personal Data to countries or by using legal mechanisms that appropriate EU government authorities have determined to provide adequate data protection, (ii) obtaining your consent to transfer your Personal Data outside the EU after first informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer, (iii) transferring your information outside the EU if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between you and MSK, including to provide treatment to you, or if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between your physician or other health care provider located in the EU, and the contract was entered into in your interest, (iv) transferring your information outside the EU if necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or (v) transferring your Personal Data outside the EU to protect your vital interests.
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice (for example, if you have an account, for as long as your account is active), subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your Personal Data erased, as discussed in the next paragraph, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.
If your Personal Data is processed for GDPR Processing Activities, you have the right to (1) see Personal Data that MSK holds about you and receive any details required to be provided to you under applicable law, (2) correct or update your Personal Data, if inaccurate, (3) limit collection and use of your Personal Data under certain circumstances (for example, if you think it is inaccurate), (4) receive your Personal Data in an electronic format as required by law, except Personal Data that has been used for public interest purposes or for MSK’s legal obligations, (5) request deletion of your Personal Data, subject to MSK’s need to keep such data to comply with legal requirements, for purposes of public health or to preserve the integrity of a research study, or to allow MSK to defend itself from legal claims, and (6) file a complaint with a data protection authority (see
this link
).  If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with your Personal Data, see the section “Contact Us” below.

This notice applies to MSK’s processing of Personal Data that is within the scope of the PIPL and describes how the information that you transmit to MSK via the App will be used by MSK. If you travel to the United States to receive treatment, this notice will not apply to the health care information collected or generated about you at MSK. Instead, you will receive a separate notice that describes how such information will be treated by MSK under U.S. federal and state law.
In this notice, Personal Data shall have the same meaning as “Personal Information” under the PIPL.  Personal Data includes information that relates to you, including but not limited to your name and address.  Personal Data also includes “Sensitive Personal Data”, which is Personal Data that is specially protected under the PIPL.  Sensitive Personal Data includes but is not limited to information about your past and present medical health, biometric characteristics, religious beliefs, specially-designated status, and your financial accounts, as well as the Personal Data of minors under the age of 14.
MSK is a Handler of your Personal Data for the purposes of the PIPL.
Description of Personal Data Handling
MSK will handle your Personal Data for the following purposes:
To diagnose your condition and/or monitor your health.
To provide treatment to you and/or a medical opinion to you and/or your health care provider in your country.
To follow-up with you and/or your health care provider in your country before, during, or after your treatment or medical opinion is provided.
To comply with MSK’s statutory duties, responsibilities, and obligations, including responding to requests of regulatory agencies.
To establish and defend against legal claims.
To support MSK’s business and institutional interests (for example, conducting quality assurance and improvement activities and managing MSK’s business operations).
To respond to your questions and/or your requests to exercise your rights over your Personal Data as provided by the PIPL.
If you have a Proxy user, to allow you to register a Proxy account and monitor parts of the medical record of the Patient who granted you Proxy access to their App account.
In order to achieve the purpose for which MSK will handle your Personal Data, MSK will handle the following categories of Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data:
Basic personal information, such as your name, date of birth, gender, family relation, address, personal phone number, or email.
Personal identity information, such as your ID number, passport, or resident certificate.
Physiological and health information, including records generated in connection with your medical treatment, such as pathological information, hospitalization records, physician’s instructions, test reports, surgical and anesthesia records, nursing records, medication administration records, drug and food allergy, fertility information, medical history, diagnosis and treatment, family illness history, history of present illness, and history of infection, and personal health information such as weight and height.
Other information, such as emergency contacts.
MSK will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this notice, unless a different retention period is required or permitted by law.
In order to achieve the above purposes, MSK will use various handling methods, including by collecting your Personal Data from you, your health care providers, and others involved in your medical treatment through email, secure web forms, physical mail, and/or digital portals designed to facilitate healthcare services.  Once MSK receives your Personal Data, MSK will store your Personal Data in a data center owned by MSK, as well as in platforms owned by MSK or provided by entrusted persons designed to store and/or handle health data, such as an electronic medical record system and radiology imaging platform.
The following types of persons and entities at, or affiliated with, MSK, will handle your Personal Data to achieve the purposes outlined in this notice:
Employees or contractors of MSK, such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, administrative staff and other members of the MSK workforce, who are involved in your treatment or rendering a medical opinion to you, or who act in furtherance of MSK’s business and institutional interests.
Contractors, vendors, collaborating entities and other entrusted persons that provide services to MSK in support of MSK’s medical services to you or in furtherance of MSK’s business and institutional interests.
Sensitive Personal Data
In order to fulfil the purposes of the Personal Data handling described in this notice, it will be necessary for MSK to handle the categories of your Sensitive Personal Data described in the section above. Without handling your Sensitive Personal Data, MSK would not be able to provide you with medical services or operate its business, as your Sensitive Personal Data is required for MSK to perform necessary actions such as diagnosing your medical condition, providing treatment or medical opinions to you, seeking payment for services, or allowing you to exercise your rights provided by the PIPL.
The handling of your Sensitive Personal Data by MSK may influence your rights and interests in various ways, some of which may not be knowable by you or MSK at the time your Personal Data is handled by MSK. However, your rights and interests may be influenced as follows:
You may receive medical services intended to benefit your health and well-being, including a diagnosis, medical opinion, or treatment provided to your or your healthcare provider in your country.
As Sensitive Personal Data is Personal Data that, according to the PIPL, is considered information that may cause harm to your dignity or grave harm to your personal or property security if leaked or illegally used, there is inherently a heightened risk to individuals whenever their Sensitive Personal Data is handled.  However, MSK has various measures in place intended to mitigate or eliminate risks to your Sensitive Personal Data, including but not limited to: information security and access management programs and a staff data privacy training program.
Your Rights Provided in the Law
You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data as provided in the PIPL, including as follows:
You have the right to consult or copy Personal Data that MSK holds about you.
You have the right request that your Personal Data be transferred to another Personal Data Handler. If you make this request, MSK will transfer your Personal Data or provide a channel through which you may transfer your Personal Data.
You have the right to correct or update your Personal Data if it is inaccurate.
You have the right to limit or refuse the collection and use of your Personal Data unless laws or administrative regulations stipulate otherwise.
If information handling is based on your consent, you have the right to rescind consent.
You have the right to request the deletion of your Personal Data.  However, there are limits on your ability to request deletion of your Personal Data. For example, MSK may keep and use some or all of your Personal Data if necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, legal and regulatory obligations related to the maintenance of medical records at MSK), or where the deletion of your Personal Data is technically hard to realize, in which case MSK shall cease handling your Personal Data except for storage and shall take necessary security protective measures.
If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with your Personal Data, see the section “Contact Us” below.

Notice to Individuals Located in the UK, EEA, or Switzerland
Personal Data about individuals located in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or the European Economic Area (together generally referred to here as the “EU”) are subject to special protections under EU law when the processing of those data are within the scope of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (“EU GDPR”), its incorporation into the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland by virtue of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and/or the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, as applicable (together, the “GDPR”). This portion of our Website Privacy Policy (the “GDPR Website Notice”) applies only to our processing of Personal Data that is within the scope of the GDPR and where we are a controller of your data, i.e., where the purpose and means of processing your data is determined by us (“GDPR Processing Activities”).
Please be aware that if you provide your Personal Data concerning your health to MSK through the Sites in order to seek care at an MSK facility or a second opinion at MSK, you will be provided a copy of our EU Patient Notice and our Notice of Privacy Practices, which will govern our use of your Personal Data concerning your health. This GDPR Website Notice will not apply to MSK’s use of such information.
We rely on separate and overlapping bases to process your Personal Data lawfully.  MSK will use the Personal Data provided through or collected on the Sites only for the purposes described in this Website Privacy Policy. MSK’s legal bases for processing your Personal Data include providing you with the information or services that you have requested, protecting your vital interests, furthering our legitimate interests, and your consent, if applicable.  When we process special categories of Personal Data, including data concerning your health, our legal bases for processing such data include protecting your vital interests, furnishing a medical diagnosis, performing preventive or occupational medicine or assessment of the working capacity of our workforce, carrying out our legal obligations under employment or social protection laws, and your consent, if applicable.  Legitimate interests that we rely on in processing your Personal Data include (i) improving and customizing the Sites for you, (ii) understanding how the Sites are being used, (iii) exploring ways to develop and grow our operations, (iv) ensuring the safety and security of the Sites, and (v) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks. Without the ability to collect and process your Personal Information, MSK would not be able to achieve those interests. We may also use your Personal Data for purposes, including scientific research, that are compatible with the purposes for which such data were initially collected.
If our processing is based solely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.  You may withdraw your consent by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.  Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn consent, if we have a legal basis to do so.  For example, we may retain certain information if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping the Sites safe and secure, or if deleting the information would undermine the integrity of a research study in which you are enrolled.
MSK is located in the United States. When you enter your Personal Data through one of the Sites, the data is being transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, and could be transferred to, stored and processed in another country outside of the EU.  Please be aware that the United States, and possibly other countries to which your Personal Data may be transferred, have not been determined by the appropriate EU government authorities to provide adequate safeguards for the protection of Personal Data.  However, MSK will take steps to maintain the privacy of your Personal Data as described in this Website Privacy Policy.  If MSK transfers your Personal Data outside the EU, we will do so in reliance on mechanisms recognized under the GDPR.  This includes (i) transferring your Personal Information to countries that the appropriate EU government authority has determined to provide adequate data protection, (ii) obtaining your consent to transfer your Personal Data outside the EU after first informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer, (iii) transferring your information outside the EU if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between you and MSK, including to provide treatment to you, or if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between your physician or other health care provider located in the EU, and the contract was entered into in your interest, (iv) transferring your information outside the EU if necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or (v) transferring your Personal Data outside the EU to protect your vital interests.
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Website Privacy Policy (for example, if you have an account, for as long as your account is active), subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your Personal Data erased, as discussed in the next paragraph, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.
If your Personal Data is processed for GDPR Processing Activities, you have the right to (1) see Personal Data that MSK holds about you and receive any details required to be provided to you under applicable law, (2) correct or update your Personal Data, if inaccurate, (3) limit collection and use of your Personal Data under certain circumstances (for example, if you think it is inaccurate), (4) receive your Personal Data in an electronic format as required by law, except Personal Data that has been used for public interest purposes or for MSK’s required legal obligations, (5) request deletion of your Personal Data, subject to MSK’s need to keep such data to comply with legal requirements, for purposes of public health or to preserve the integrity of a research study, or to allow itself to defend itself from legal claims, and (6) file a complaint with a data protection authority (see
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm
). If you want to exercise your rights over your Personal Data, please contact us at
dsr@mskcc.org
. If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with your Personal Data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
