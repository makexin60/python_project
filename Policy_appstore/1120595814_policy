Privacy Policy
Hi! Thanks for downloading my app! 
            I am committed to maintaining your trust and confidence in my apps. 
            I’m a young indie developer and I want you to know that I do not store your data.
In this Privacy Policy, I’ve provided information on when and why I collect your information, 
            how I use it, and the limited conditions under which I may disclose it to others.
Types of data that the apps collect:
Location data (e.g. so the app can serve you the latest weather or find restaurants near you).
This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone (the data is anonymised).
Also, this location data is not stored anywhere outside your device.
I may share anonymised information with other organisation such as Google Admob to serve relevant ads in the app. You can find out more

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my app!
