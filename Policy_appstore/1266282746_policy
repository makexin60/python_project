We process your personal data in order to provide you with our services and to assist us in the operation of our business.  Under data protection law we are required to ensure that there is an appropriate basis for the processing of your personal data, and we are required to let you know what that basis is.
There are various options under data protection law, but the primary bases that we use are (a) processing necessary for the performance of our contracts with you, (b) processing necessary in order for us to pursue our legitimate interests, (c) processing where we have your and/or your dependants’ consent, (d) processing that is required under applicable law, and (e) we process health related data using Section 50 of the Data Protection Act 2018.
Here are further details of our processing of your personal data below, together with the basis for that processing:
Administering your policies –
We will process your personal data in order to administer your policy.  This includes processing your personal data in order to make and receive payments, and to maintain our records of the insurance products that you have purchased.  Where we process your personal data in order to administer your policy this will be on the basis that it is necessary in order for the performance of our contract with you.
Providing you with quotes –
We will process your personal data in order to provide you with a quote for insurance and to provide communications regarding this quote. Where we process your personal data in order to provide you with a quote this will be on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our contract with you or to process this data at your request prior to entering into a contract.
Providing you with services -
Vhi provides different channels to engage with you in order to perform our contractual obligations, including where you have opted to avail of electronic channels such as MyVhi, our mobile app and Snap and Send. The MyVhi section of our website, and our mobile applications, give you access to your policy documents and information in one secure place, anytime, anywhere.  We also provide a Snap and Send feature that allows you to send us your day to day receipts on the go. Where we process health related claims data in the context of providing these services, this will be on the basis that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of providing health insurance policies as part of our business.
Processing claims –
In order to process a claim that you make under a policy we will need to process personal data in relation to the claim.  This includes the underlying medical condition that is treated, your medical history, the medical services that you receive and details of previous policies you may have had (in order to calculate waiting periods and determine coverage for pre-existing conditions).  We will also need to process your personal data in order to deal with queries about your level of cover, to highlight benefits under your policy that are most relevant to you, for pre-certification/approval of treatment, or to deal with complaints from you or a medical services provider. To process health related data we use Section 50 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  When we process a claim on a child under the age of 18 years of age that is insured on your policy, we will communicate with the policyholder in relation to that claim, if the child turns 18 during the processing of that claim we will continue to communicate with the policyholder for the duration of the claim.                                                                                                                                                                  If your claim is successful, we will process your personal data in order to refund you fees that you may have incurred or pay the medical services provider.  Where we process health related claims data, this will be on the basis that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of administering your health insurance policy
Running our business –
Like all insurance companies it is essential to ensure that we can manage the costs of claims and determine what treatments and services each of our policies can cover. In order to do this we undertake extensive modelling of the current and historic claims made by our customers, which we use to identify patterns in claims, to try to predict future trends and how they might affect our business, and to undertake pricing and profitability and studies. This information may be used to help us develop new product benefits and services.  We also carry out auditing and quality control to check that our processes are robust and are being followed.  In addition, we also need to process your data to meet certain regulatory and legislative obligations that apply to our business.                                                                                                                                                                  We try to do all of the above by using aggregated or anonymous data where possible, so you won’t be identifiable from the data, but some of this work involves processing your data without anonymising it. Where we process health related claims data, this will be on the basis that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of providing health insurance policies as part of our business.
Information updates - We may provide you with information and updates on unused benefits on related information that may assist in making the best use of your VHI policy and would be in the legitimate interest of VHI. You can opt out of these communications at any time by contacting us using the contact details at the bottom of this notice or the contact details included in any communication sent to you
Marketing –
We may send you marketing communications about our products and services that are relevant to you and which would be in the legitimate interest of Vhi. You can opt out of these marketing communications at any time by contacting us using the contact details at the bottom of this notice or using the contact details at the bottom of each marketing communication.                                                                                                                                                                                              Where we process any health related data in relation to you for marketing communications, this will be based on consent. This consent is completely optional and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time.
Customer feedback surveys and market research –
We may send you market research communications, including survey invitations about your experiences with our products and services that are relevant to you, and which would be in the legitimate interest of Vhi. You can opt out of these surveys at any time by using the opt-out process contained as part of the survey invite or by contacting us using the contact details at the bottom of this notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Where we process any health related data in relation to you for survey invites, this will be based on consent. This consent is completely optional and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time. While we try to carry out market research and surveys using aggregated or anonymous data, in order to measure the success of these campaigns we may process your personal data.
Fraud prevention and claims management –
It is an unfortunate feature of any insurance and health systems that fraud can occur from time to time. We have a number of systems and procedures in place to monitor for potentially fraudulent claims, or claims for inappropriate treatments and procedures. If we identify a suspicious claim or pattern of claims, we will process your personal data in order to investigate the claim and to take appropriate measures to protect Vhi and its members and on occasion this may require further access to medical information/medical records. Where we process health data in connection with fraud prevention and claims management, this will be on the basis that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of administering your health insurance policy. If your part of a company paid group scheme and your policy is cancelled we will notify your company that the policy has been cancelled.
Administering our computer systems –
Vhi relies on state of the art technology and computer systems to run our business and to process claims.  We have an extensive team of developers and support engineers who are constantly testing our systems, running trials of new software, and providing support to our users.                                                                                                                    Where possible we try to use test data or anonymised data, but on occasion we may have to access live data directly, or we will often make a copy of some of the data that sits in our live systems and run our tests on that to make sure everything is working before we roll out a change.  These copies may include your personal data, including details in relation to claims you have made.  In general this processing of your personal data is justified by our legitimate interests in making sure our computer systems run properly and are safe and secure.  If we process health data when running these tests or providing support services to our users, this will be on the basis that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of providing health insurance policies as part of our business.

When we receive a claim we want to make sure that we process it as quickly as possible. We have therefore developed a system that undertakes an initial assessment of your claim automatically. Most of the time the system will be able to identify that a claim should be paid out, at which point the claim is then processed automatically. The algorithms we use for automated processing are simply the Terms and Conditions and Table of Benefits relevant to your plan, written into software code. Each claim is then assessed under the rules relevant to the treatment/procedure in question along with the information you have provided (the invoices, receipts etc.). If your claim is rejected through automated processing we will always send you the reason in plain English that reflects the relevant rule under your Terms and Conditions and/or Table of Benefits that triggered the rejection. The explanation provided would be the same as if the claim had been manually adjudicated, because the same software coding is used for manual adjudication on our systems. If the rejection occurred because we need you to provide some further information to us we will explain exactly what we need and you can then re-submit your claim accordingly. Also, you always have the right to object or appeal a claims decision by contacting us at either of the following:
Post: Vhi Healthcare, IDA Business Park, Purcellsinch, Dublin Road, Kilkenny.
Phone: (056) 444 4444

Managing legal claims - When we assess how long we keep personal data we take into account whether that data may be required in order to defend any legal claims which may be made. If such data is required, we may keep it until the statute of limitations runs out in relation to the type of claim that can be made (which varies from 2 to 12 years).
Business requirements - As we only collect personal data for defined purposes, we assess how long we need to keep personal data for in order to meet our reasonable business purposes.

In the event that you use the App to locate a parkrun accessible to your current location please note that the App sends your request to parkrun directly (without disclosing any personal data other than your location). The App will then provide you with a list of the five nearest parkruns. The App does not use any location data other than as is strictly necessary to provide you with the list of parkruns and does not use it for any other purpose. From time to time this feature might be disabled; in this case no location data is used.
When you link your parkrun account with the Vhi parkrun Rewards feature you will be asked to provide your parkrun ID to verify your account with parkrun. We will also share your parkrun ID number and your date of birth at this stage to validate your account.
Policy Termination in the event that your Vhi policy is terminated (you leave Vhi or cancel or do not renew your policy or do not hold any other Vhi policies) all data in relation to your parkrun activity sent from parkrun to Vhi will cease to be sent. This includes the information received from parkrun (location of parkrun, timings, parkrun activity). This means your participation in the Vhi parkrun rewards programme has concluded.
