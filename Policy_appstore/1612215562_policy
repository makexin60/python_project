Introduction
McArthurGlen develops and manages designer outlet centres ("
Centres
") across the UK, Europe and Canada. We provide services at these Centres and process your personal data for the reasons set out in this Website, App and Centre Visitor Privacy Notice ("
Privacy Notice
"), including to facilitate and enhance your experience at these centres and on our website and apps.
In this notice, where we refer to "
McArthurGlen
", "
we
", "
us
" or "
our"
, this means the McArthurGlen Group Company or Group Companies responsible for processing your personal data.
McArthurGlen UK Limited is the primary controller of personal data for the McArthurGlen Group, but there will be circumstances where McArthurGlen UK Limited and the relevant McArthurGlen Group Company or Companies act as joint controllers. "Joint controllers" jointly determine how and why we process your personal data. For example, in some instances, McArthurGlen UK Limited, along with a Group Company or Group Companies, may act as joint controllers of your personal data which we share between us in order to evaluate and improve our services.
When visiting our Centres, the controller for some personal data collected (e.g. in relation to outlet centre security and CCTV collection) is the relevant Group Company (as defined below) in that country as identified through signage/notices at that Centre.
Purpose and overview of this Privacy Notice
McArthurGlen takes the privacy of your personal data seriously. We understand that by providing your personal data – whether through use of our website, mobile apps, including the McArthurGlen Club app ("
apps
"), or other digital services, visiting our Centres (including in relation to data collected through CCTV) or logging into our WiFi – you are entrusting us with your information.
We have developed this Privacy Notice to give you full transparency about the information we collect from you online, why we collect it and how we use it. This Privacy Notice also explains what personal information we collect and record at our Centres - on our in-Centre computers and devices and in certain cases offline- and what we do with that information. We also need to ensure that you understand the rights you have over your personal data, including your rights of access to that data and how you can correct it and erase it. These rights are described below.
Annexed to this Privacy Notice is additional information that relates specifically to the personal information we collect and record when you use WiFi provided by us (“
WiFi Annex
”).
Please note that there is additional information in the jurisdiction-specific information section at the end of this Privacy Notice. If you use our services when located in one of the jurisdictions named in that section, then any information in the section relating to your jurisdiction takes precedence over any conflicting information in the other parts of this Privacy Notice. If you are in the European Economic Area ("
EEA
"), the GDPR applies to the processing of your personal data. If you are in the UK, the UK GDPR applies to your personal data.

dataprotection@mcarthurglen.com
to indicate that you do not want to receive direct marketing communications from us.

Where appropriate, and in line with their own policies, we may match information from these sites to better understand and improve our customers' experience. This includes posts or other information made public or made available to us where you use hashtags or tags relating to us, our business, the Centre Owners, the Centres and our industry. Information from these sites may include information which has been held outside the UK and European Union.
Legal bases for processing your information
We are required by data protection law to have a lawful basis or reason for processing your personal data, which we explain in this section.
We process your personal information with your
consent
when you agree that we may place certain types of cookies, when you agree to receiving certain direct marketing or on other occasions where we ask you for consent. Where we process personal information based on consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time (without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal).
We process your personal information when we are required to do so by
law
, including in response to requests by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation or court orders.
We process your personal information when it is necessary for the performance of a
contract
to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. This applies in any case where we provide or deliver products and services to you pursuant to a contract, such as when you have signed up for Privilege Club or its replacement, known as McArthurGlen Club, or when you purchase a gift card, process your registration on the website or enter into a competition. If you do not provide the personal information that we need in order to provide or deliver the service, we will not be able to provide or deliver services to you.
We also process your personal information when it is necessary for the purposes of a
legitimate interest
pursued by us or a third party (when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights). These legitimate interests include the administration and running of our business, marketing our products and services to our customers, servicing our existing customers, protecting our business and assets and improving our services to current and potential customers. Further details of our legitimate interests are included in the table above.
Special categories of personal data and criminal data
We are required to have an additional lawful basis when we process
special categories of personal data
and comply with requirements as set out in data protection law when we process
criminal conviction or offence data
. We do not collect special categories of personal data or criminal conviction or offence data about you, other than in limited circumstances described below:
On occasion, we may collect data relating to injuries or illnesses occurring in our Centres or other premises. We may also process health data where it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest  (Art 9(2)(g) GDPR/UK GDPR) and to establish, exercise or defend legal claims (Art 9(2)(f) UK GDPR/GDPR). We may also request your explicit consent to process such data (Art 9(2)(a) GDPR/UK GDPR). Very rarely, we may process such data where it is necessary to protect your life (Art 9(2)(c) GDPR/UK GDPR).
It is also possible that we will on occasion process special categories of personal data about you, where you expressly provide it or when this is inferred from data you provide to us, e.g. where you include it in the personalised message you write when purchasing a gift card. Please avoid providing us with any special categories of personal information, such as that related to health, race, ethnicity or religion, other than when it is strictly required or requested by us in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
We will process criminal conviction or offence data in limited circumstances, such as for the prevention or detection of unlawful acts or for the purposes of legal claims (Art 10 GDPR/UK GDPR in conjunction with the conditions set out in local law). The processing of criminal data will be carried out in compliance with the applicable UK, European and/or local legislation on public security and terrorism prevention.
Information sharing
We disclose or transfer personal information to other parties as follows:
to our Group Companies (including subsidiary management companies), Centre Owners, investors and joint venture partners;
to third party service providers that perform functions on our behalf in relation to the Site and apps or our Centres and for the purposes set out in this Policy (for example, website hosting, social media analysis providers (e.g. Google), marketing email service providers, data analysts and website developers);
our lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers;
our insurers, claims and loss adjusters and auditors;
other insurance companies to support their legitimate interests, or those of their clients;
to brand partners (stores) in order to fulfil Click and Reserve orders;
media agencies and their advertising partners in order to run targeted marketing campaigns as described above;
to regulators, law enforcement agencies and government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government and law enforcement authorities or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas;
We also disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of our website or apps, or other third parties and to detect, prevent and respond to such activity. We may therefore share CCTV, body-worn camera footage, photo, video and/or audio recordings and/or automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) data with law enforcement agencies, government or local authorities, tenants, our other Centres and local crime reduction partnerships and initiatives.  Additionally, we cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property rights and other rights;
to sellers or buyers as part of a sale or merger of our business or assets;
to an applicable Centre Owner, a Group Company or to buyers as part of a sale or merger of a Centre Owner or Centre. In addition, if McArthurGlen UK Limited or one of our Group Companies ceases the role as a manager of a Centre, we will need to transfer your personal data to the Centre Owner or the replacement manager to ensure the continuity of our products and services; and
as described in the WiFi Annex.
In addition, subject to your consent where required by law, we share your personal information with carefully selected third parties so that they can send you information about special promotions and offers.
To enhance your shopping experience, our website and apps may include links to other websites. Those websites will have their own privacy policies that you may wish to review. We have no control over, or responsibility for, the data processing carried out by these linked websites.
We also share information about visitors to this website or apps in an anonymous or aggregate form with third parties including advertisers, business partners and sponsors, to understand customer trends and patterns and manage and improve our business relationships.
Securing your information
We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information as you visit and use the website and our apps and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Unfortunately, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and we recommend that you follow reasonable precautions, e.g. when using public WiFi networks to transmit data.
Transferrin
g y
our information
We transfer personal information to countries outside the UK and EEA to our Group Companies and to third parties, including to countries which have different data protection standards to those which apply in the UK and EEA.
Where service providers process your personal information in countries deemed adequate by (as applicable) the European Commission or the UK, we rely on the European Commission's or the UK's adequacy decision to protect your personal information.
For transfers to Group Companies and service providers outside the EEA or UK where there is no adequacy decision in place, we use EU Standard Contractual Clauses, UK Standard Contractual Clauses (as applicable) or rely on (data protection authority approved) corporate rules that are in place to protect your personal information. You have a right to ask us for a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses or a copy of the other safeguards used by contacting us as set out below.
Retaining your data
We retain personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and as permitted or required by law.
In general, we will only retain your personal data so long as the original purpose for which that personal data was collected still applies although we may retain it longer if necessary for legal reasons such as retaining data to deal with any disputes or for regulatory reasons such as tax and accounting purposes. We will only ever retain your personal data for a limited period of time, for example where we retain your personal data for customer relationship management purposes, this is generally retained for three years from the date of your last interaction with us.
Your rights
Subject to certain conditions, you may ask us for a copy of your information and, where applicable, to correct it, erase it or to transfer it to you or other organisations at your request. You also have rights to object to some processing and, where we have asked for your consent to process your personal information, to withdraw this consent. Where you withdraw your consent, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data which was carried out before the withdrawal of your consent.
You also have the right to restrict the way in which we process your personal data in some situations which means you may limit the way in which we use your personal data. Where we process your personal information because we have a legitimate interest in doing so or for direct marketing purposes (as explained above), you also have a right to object to this. These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information.
You have the right to make a request to exercise these rights to the relevant controller entity (i.e. McArthurGlen UK Limited and/or another relevant Group Company, as applicable). Please contact us at
dataprotection@mcarthurglen.com
if you wish to make a request exercising your rights. This is the email for all rights requests to the McArthurGlen group. Alternatively, you can contact the relevant McArthurGlen group entity directly (see the contact details below). Where we act as joint controllers, you can contact any of the relevant Group Companies to exercise your data protection rights at
dataprotection@mcarthurglen.com
When making the request, please provide your full name and address and/or email address in exactly the form in which they were originally provided to us to avoid any possible confusion with a different individual. We may ask you for further information to verify your identity.
Complaint
If you have any concerns about our use of your personal information, you can make a complaint to us at
dataprotection@mcarthurglen.com

WiFi Annex
Introduction
This WiFi Annex to the Privacy Notice relates to your use of a WiFi service (the “
WiFi Service
”) at our Centres which is provided by or on behalf of McArthurGlen UK Limited (referred to in this WiFi Annex as "
McArthurGlen
", "
we
", "
us
" or "
our
") . This WiFi Annex, in addition to the Privacy Notice, explains in further detail how we use your personal information we collect and generate when you use the WiFi Service.
For the purposes of this WiFi Annex, “
Group Company
” has the same meaning as set out in the Privacy Notice.
Information we collect
We collect, receive, store and process the following information about you:
information that you provide when registering for the WiFi Service (e.g. name, address, telephone numbers, email address and date of birth);
your device details and MAC address (see below for further information about MAC addresses);
details about when and where you connect to the WiFi Service, including your venue location and the WiFi access point(s) where you are using the WiFi service. This data will be collected automatically by the wireless access point unless your phone/device is switched off or you have switched off WiFi on your phone/device; and
your communications with us in connection with the WiFi Service.
If it is mandatory for you to provide personal information, we will make this clear at the time and will also explain what will happen if you do not provide the information.
We will collect your personal information from you and from your use of the WiFi Service, from our WiFi providers and from social media providers if you register using a social media account.
A MAC address is a unique identifier for your device that tells us the make of a device, e.g. Samsung or Apple, but it does not tell us your name or phone number, or allow us to access any data held on your device. If your WiFi settings on your mobile device are turned on when you visit one of our locations (including the parking area but no further) then we automatically collect the MAC address from your device. We explain how we use MAC addresses in the next section.
Use of your information
In addition to the purposes described in the Privacy Notice, in respect of the WiFi Service we use your personal information for the purposes set out in the table below. In this table any reference to “our legitimate interests” will be replaced with “reasonable and legitimate purposes as permitted by law” in respect of Canada only.
