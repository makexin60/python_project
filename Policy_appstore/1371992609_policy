Data is processed for purposes that are primarily geared toward the specific insurance contracts concluded, and may include requirements analyses and insurance consultations. For information regarding further purposes of data processing conducted as part of the contractual relationship, please refer to the
general Privacy Policy of the Helsana Group

If, in individual cases, you have consented to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose, we will base the processing on this consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time, whereby such withdrawal only applies to the future and does not affect the legality of data processing already carried out.

The consent portal enables customers to manage topics of interest to them on a targeted, individual basis, allowing us to take more customer-specific wishes into account. New consent options are continuously being created.
Since the portal has been embedded at the heart of the Helsana infrastructure, further touchpoints can also be integrated in order to generate added value for customers.
5.1 Cookies
5.1.1 What are cookies?
We use cookies on our Websites. Cookies are small text files that are sent by the websites you visit to the browser you use (Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.) and stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. They enable websites to run or are intended to provide information to the owners of a website or third parties who receive data from this Website, such as information about the devices you use and your preferences. Cookies store certain settings about your browser as well as data concerning interactions with the Website through your browser. When a cookie is activated, it is assigned an identification number (cookie ID), which is used to identify your browser and use the information contained in the cookie. Generally speaking, this information does not identify you directly, however it can make it possible for you to have a tailored online experience.
Most of the cookies we use are temporary session cookies that are automatically deleted from your computer or mobile device at the end of your browser session. We also use permanent cookies. These remain stored on your computer or mobile device after your browser session has ended. Depending on the type of cookie, permanent cookies remain stored on your computer or mobile device for up to two years and are automatically deactivated after the scheduled period has expired.
5.1.2 Why do we use cookies?
The cookies we use help enable various features offered by our Websites. For example, cookies help save your language preferences across different pages visited during a single Internet session and thus facilitate your access to the Websites. Cookies also enable us to track and analyse the behaviour of visitors to our Websites. This helps us design our Websites in a more user-friendly, effective way and, to make your visit to our Websites as pleasant as possible and to improve the Website’s general visitor experience.
If you use the myHelsana client portal or other parts of our Website where users must log in to access content, the Website may use cookies or some other technology that helps us authenticate you more easily, store and recognise your configuration and user attributes, facilitate your navigation on the Website and provide you with more tailored content to make the available information more interesting for you.
However, cookies also enable us to personalise the content of our Website in general. We also use remarketing cookies to help us target advertisements on other websites to the interests of our Website’s visitors based on the pages you view on our Website. Cookies on our Websites additionally enable us to offer social media features that let you share content via Facebook, X (Twitter), etc.
5.1.3 How can you change your cookie settings?
In the cookie preference centre you can adjust your consent to the use of cookies on our Website at any time based on your needs.
Cookie settings
You can choose at any time to set your browser such that no cookies are accepted or saved. Instead, you can choose to receive a warning message each time before accepting a cookie or set your browser to accept only cookies from certain websites. You can also delete any cookies that have already been saved at any time.
We would like to point out that the use of individual features offered by our Website may be restricted or prevented altogether if you reject cookies from the Website. To make navigation easier, we recommend that you accept cookies and do not delete them. If you block cookies, you may not be able to make full use of the interactive features on this Website.
5.1.4 Which cookies do we use?

Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:

5.2 Web analytics
5.2.1 Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target
We use Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target or similar services on our Website. These are services provided by third parties, generally in Europe but also worldwide (in the case of Adobe products this is Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 6 Riverwalk, Naas Road, Dublin 24, Ireland,
www.adobe.com
), which we can use to measure and evaluate the use of the Website. Permanent cookies, set by the service provider, are also used for this purpose. The service provider does not receive any personal data from us (and does not store any IP addresses), but may track your use of the Website, combine this information with data from other websites you have visited and which are also tracked by service providers and use these findings for its own purposes (e.g. to control advertising). If you are registered with the service provider, the service provider also recognises you. The service provider’s processing of your personal data is then the responsibility of the service provider and is carried out in accordance with its data protection provisions. The service provider merely informs us how our respective Website is used (without any information about you personally). You can find more information about Adobe’s web analytics services at
https://www.adobe.com/uk/privacy/policy.html
.
5.2.3 Adobe Campaign
Helsana uses Adobe Campaign for personalised e-mail marketing (e.g. personalised forms of address in product mailings and when sending out newsletters). The data is stored in the Adobe Experience Cloud in Ireland on behalf of Helsana.
5.2.4 Adobe Tags
Helsana uses the tag manager Adobe Tags. This service allows us to manage Website tags such as analytics tags and advertising networks such as Google and social media. The tag manager only implements tags and does not collect any personal data. The tag manager triggers other tags that may collect personal data, based on your consent and privacy settings in the cookie preference centre and consent portal. Cookies and tracking that are disabled at domain or cookie level remain disabled if they are implemented with the tag manager.
5.2.5 Google remarketing and AdWords
Google remarketing and AdWords are used to analyse your browsing habits and show you targeted, personalised advertising while you are browsing the web or using the Google search engine. In this way, personalised advertising messages tailored to you on the basis on your previous usage and browsing habits on one device (e.g. smartphone) can also be displayed on your other devices (e.g. tablet or PC).
You can permanently object to cross-device remarketing/targeting by disabling personalised advertising in your Google account. The data is collected on the basis of the consent granted via your Google account. If data collection cannot be reconciled with your Google account settings, data is collected on the basis of Helsana’s legitimate interests in the anonymised analysis of Website visitors for advertising purposes.
5.2.6 Google Marketing Platform (formerly Double Click)
Helsana uses Google Marketing Platform (formerly DoubleClick), a web analytics service provided by Google, on its Websites. The platform optimises the interaction with Google Adwords by setting cookies when you view an advert or click on one of our advertising banners on a partner website. The aim is to show you banners that are more interesting to you. The cookie enables us to record certain data on the interaction between your browser and a particular display. It also records whether you looked at an advert, clicked on it and ultimately concluded a contract with Helsana via this channel. The information stored locally (user or client side) in the cookie about the use of our Websites is transferred to Google servers and saved there.
5.3 Friendly Captcha
We use the Friendly Captcha service on our Website. This service is provided by Friendly Captcha GmbH, Am Anger 3-5, 82237 Wörthsee, Germany. Friendly Captcha is an innovative, privacy-first protection solution that defends our Website against automated programs and scripts (bots). Data is used solely to protect the Website from spam and bots. Friendly Captcha does not store or read any cookies on the visitor’s device. IP addresses are only stored in hashed form (a one-way encryption method), meaning that neither we nor Friendly Captcha are able make any inferences about individuals’ identities. The basis for processing is our predominantly private and legitimate interest in protecting our Website against abuse by bots and hence against spam and attacks (e.g. flooding attacks). You can find further information about data protection in connection with the use of Friendly Captcha at
https://friendlycaptcha.com/legal/privacy-end-users/
.
5.4 Social plug-ins
Our Websites use social media plug-ins, e.g. for Facebook, X (Twitter) or Google+ (providers). These plug-ins are labelled with the provider’s logo and can, for example, be a Like button, a Google+ button or a X (Twitter) button.
When you visit one of our Websites which contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection with the provider’s computers. The provider’s website sends the content of the plug-in directly to your browser, which incorporates it into the Website. Through the incorporation of the plug-in, the provider is informed that you visited our Website. If you are logged in to your account on the provider’s website at the same time, the provider can match the visit to your profile. If you interact with the plug-ins – for example by pressing the Like button or posting a comment – the corresponding information is sent by your browser directly to the provider and stored on their servers.
If you do not want the provider to collect data on you via our Website, you have to log out of your account on the provider’s website before visiting our Website. Even if you have logged out of your account, providers still collect data in anonymised form via the social plug-ins and set a cookie on your device. If you log in to your account on the provider’s website at a later date, this data can be linked to your profile.
If a login is offered via a social login service, e.g. Facebook Connect, data will be exchanged between the provider and our Website. In the case of Facebook Connect, this could be, for example, data from your public Facebook profile. By using such login services, you are agreeing to the transfer of your data.
Please see the provider’s privacy policy for the purpose and scope of the data collected and the further processing of your data by the provider, as well as your associated rights and configuration options to protect your privacy:
For Facebook:
https://www.facebook.com/policy
For Google:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en
For X (formerly Twitter Inc.):
http://twitter.com/privacy
For Instagram:
https://privacycenter.instagram.com/
5.5 Microsoft Advertising
Helsana uses the Microsoft Advertising service on this Website. When the service is used, Microsoft stores a cookie on your device if you access the Helsana Website via a Microsoft advert. By using Microsoft Advertising, Helsana can find out which campaigns have achieved which objectives. Only pseudonymous user profiles are created.
You can reject the setting of cookies and the processing of the data obtained by Microsoft. This can be done via the browser setting that generally disables the automatic setting of cookies. Further information about data protection and the cookies used by Microsoft.
5.6 Adjust
Helsana uses the Adjust analytics tool, a product from the company Adjust GmbH (Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405 Berlin, Germany). When users install a Helsana+ app (myHelsana, Helsana+, Helsana Coach), Adjust saves technical records relating to app installations and initial access to the Helsana+ app (e.g. use of the app or interactions in the user account, e.g. clicking on the individual menu items). The tool makes it possible to direct advertising in Google Adwords, DoubleClick, Facebook and X (Twitter) more specifically to user preferences.
Adjust bases its analyses on app users’ IP and MAC addresses, which are used by Helsana on an anonymised basis only. Users can revoke tracking by Adjust, and thus prevent targeted advertising, at any time by going to
https://www.adjust.com/forget-device/
. You can find further information on the Adjust data privacy policy at
https://www.adjust.com/privacy-policy/
.
6.1 Logging
When you read our e-mails, we record the time at which they are opened. We also record when you click on links or articles in the e-mail, which ones and whether you unsubscribe from further e-mail communications/newsletters.
6.2 Intended use of the data collected through logging
We use the data logged to present you with optimised content and offers in the future. Your data is used solely for the provision of services from the Helsana Group. When processing personal data, we comply with regulatory requirements, in particular the Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG).
The data logged will not be passed on to third parties.
6.3 Unsubscribing
You can unsubscribe from our e-mail communications/newsletters at any time. To do so, please refer to the instructions in the footer of every e-mail.
We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data collected via Websites against unauthorised processing, loss and destruction. We are also concerned about the confidentiality, availability and integrity of your personal data.
We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services available on the Website or for other processing purposes, such as fulfilling legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our policies. If we have a legal obligation to retain your personal data, we will delete it after expiry of the respective retention period.
Regardless of how we collect your personal data in connection with the Website, all Helsana Group companies have access to this personal data. This means that your personal data can also be processed for various purposes and linked together with personal data that is collected by another company of the Helsana Group.
Furthermore and to the extent permitted by applicable (data protection) law, Helsana may also disclose personal data to contracted service providers (both inside and outside Switzerland). In connection with data collected on the Website, these specifically consist of IT service providers working in the area of data storage and data analysis.
Personal data obtained in connection with the use of the Website may also be disclosed to third parties (inside or outside Switzerland) if we are obliged to do so by law, by court order or by official order or if this is necessary to support internal or external investigations, other legal investigations or proceedings in Switzerland or abroad or any corporate transactions.
We mainly process and store data in Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA), but in exceptional cases may potentially do so in any country in the world, for example through subcontractors of our service providers. If data is transferred to a country without adequate data protection, Helsana guarantees adequate protection through the use of sufficient contractual guarantees, specifically on the basis of EU Standard Contractual Clauses, binding corporate rules or based on exceptions with respect to consent, contract execution, the determination, exercise or enforcement of legal claims, overriding public interest, the data published by you or because it is necessary to protect your individual integrity. You may request a copy of the contractual guarantees by sending a written request along with a copy of an official form of identification to the contact address specified above (see Section 2) or find out from this contact where you can obtain such a copy. Helsana reserves the right to black out such copies for reasons of data protection or secrecy or to deliver only excerpts.
Profiling refers to the automated processing of personal data in order to analyse personal characteristics or produce forecasts. For example, profiling can be used to carry out analyses of personal interests, preferences, affinities or habits.
We do not generally carry out any profiling for the purposes of operating the Websites, except where you consent via the cookie banner to the use of web analytics tools (e.g. Adobe Analytics or Adobe Target). Unless you access the Website via a personalised link or invitation e-mail, your user activity itself is not personalised.
Your user activity on the Websites is evaluated in order to provide you with an individualised user experience along with offers and services that are tailored to your interests and preferences. If you do not accept the web analytics cookies, no profiling is carried out as your user activity is not recorded.
We do not use automated individual decision-making as defined in the applicable legal provisions for the purposes of operating the Website. Should we use these methods in individual cases, we will inform you separately if this is required by law.
Access to the Website and the related collection of connection data (such as IP addresses) must be logged; this happens automatically during use and cannot be disabled for individual users. With the exception of the data required for technical reasons (see Section 3.1 above), you are not obliged to provide us with any personal data in connection with your use of the Website. However, certain services cannot be used without the provision of personal data, or their functionality will be impaired.
Within the scope of the data protection law applicable to you, you have the right to access your data, to have it rectified or erased, the right to restrict data processing and otherwise to object to our data processing and to the disclosure of certain personal data for the purpose of transferring such personal data to another location (data portability). If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you may withdraw this consent at any time. Exercising these rights usually requires that you can clearly prove your identity. Please note, however, that we reserve the right to enforce the statutory restrictions, for example if we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have an overriding interest in it (insofar as we may invoke it) or need it for enforcing claims.
If Helsana makes an automated decision concerning an individual person that has a legal impact on the data subject or significantly affects them in a similar way, the data subject may speak to a competent person at Helsana and request a reconsideration of the decision, or demand that the matter be assessed by a competent person from the outset, to the extent provided for by law. In this case, the data subject might no longer be able to use certain automated services. The person will be informed of such decisions subsequently or separately in advance.
Every data subject has the right to file a complaint with the competent data protection authority. In Switzerland, this is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (
http://www.edoeb.admin.ch
).
You can also prevent or restrict the installation of cookies by changing your browser settings accordingly. However, we would like to point out that, in this case, you may not be able to use all the features of this Website to their full extent.
You can also take the following technical steps to prevent the automated data processing carried out on this Website:
Google Analytics: Install the browser add-on by clicking on the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
If you do not want the provider of social plug-ins to collect data on you via our Website, you have to log out of your account on the provider’s website before visiting our Website. Even if you have logged out of your account, providers still collect data in anonymised form via the social plug-ins and set a cookie on your device. If you log in to your account on the provider’s website at a later date, this data can be linked to your profile.
Helsana may modify this Privacy Policy at any time without advance notice and without notification. The version currently published on the Website shall apply.

Cookie settings
As described below, certain uses of the Website also require Helsana to collect personal data. When using the Website, you either provide this manually (see Section 4 below), or it is provided based on your web browser’s technical settings and is either automatically collected or made available by third parties in accordance with those settings (see Section 5).

For information regarding further purposes of data processing conducted as part of the contractual relationship, please refer to the
general Privacy Policy of the Helsana Group

If, in individual cases, you have consented to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose, we will base the processing on this consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time, whereby such withdrawal only applies to the future and does not affect the legality of data processing already carried out.

5.1 Cookies
5.1.1 What are cookies?
We use cookies on our Websites. Cookies are small text files that are sent by the websites you visit to the browser you use (Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.) and stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. They enable websites to run or are intended to provide information to the owners of a website or third parties who receive data from this Website, such as information about the devices you use and your preferences. Cookies store certain settings about your browser as well as data concerning interactions with the Website through your browser. When a cookie is activated, it is assigned an identification number (cookie ID), which is used to identify your browser and use the information contained in the cookie. Generally speaking, this information does not identify you directly, however it can make it possible for you to have a tailored online experience.
Most of the cookies we use are temporary session cookies that are automatically deleted from your computer or mobile device at the end of your browser session. We also use permanent cookies. These remain stored on your computer or mobile device after your browser session has ended. Depending on the type of cookie, permanent cookies remain stored on your computer or mobile device for up to two years and are automatically deactivated after the scheduled period has expired.
5.1.2 Why do we use cookies?
The cookies we use help enable various features offered by our Websites. For example, cookies help save your language preferences across different pages visited during a single Internet session and thus facilitate your access to the Websites. Cookies also enable us to track and analyse the behaviour of visitors to our Websites. This helps us design our Websites in a more user-friendly, effective way and, to make your visit to our Websites as pleasant as possible and to improve the Website’s general visitor experience.

Cookies on our Websites additionally enable us to offer social media features that let you share content via Facebook, X (Twitter), etc.
5.1.3 How can you change your cookie settings?
In the cookie preference centre you can adjust your consent to the use of cookies on our Website at any time based on your needs.

More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:

5.2 Web analytics
5.2.1 Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target
We use Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target or similar services on our Website. These are services provided by third parties, generally in Europe but also worldwide (in the case of Adobe products this is Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 6 Riverwalk, Naas Road, Dublin 24, Ireland,
www.adobe.com
), which we can use to measure and evaluate the use of the Website. Permanent cookies, set by the service provider, are also used for this purpose. The service provider does not receive any personal data from us (and does not store any IP addresses), but may track your use of the Website, combine this information with data from other websites you have visited and which are also tracked by service providers and use these findings for its own purposes (e.g. to control advertising). If you are registered with the service provider, the service provider also recognises you. The service provider’s processing of your personal data is then the responsibility of the service provider and is carried out in accordance with its data protection provisions. The service provider merely informs us how our respective Website is used (without any information about you personally). You can find more information about Adobe’s web analytics services at

5.2.3 Adobe Campaign
Helsana uses Adobe Campaign for personalised e-mail marketing (e.g. personalised forms of address in product mailings and when sending out newsletters). The data is stored in the Adobe Experience Cloud in Ireland on behalf of Helsana.
5.2.4 Adobe Tags
Helsana uses the tag manager Adobe Tags. This service allows us to manage Website tags such as analytics tags and advertising networks such as Google and social media. The tag manager only implements tags and does not collect any personal data. The tag manager triggers other tags that may collect personal data, based on your consent and privacy settings in the cookie preference centre and consent portal. Cookies and tracking that are disabled at domain or cookie level remain disabled if they are implemented with the tag manager.
5.2.5 Google remarketing and AdWords
Google remarketing and AdWords are used to analyse your browsing habits and show you targeted, personalised advertising while you are browsing the web or using the Google search engine. In this way, personalised advertising messages tailored to you on the basis on your previous usage and browsing habits on one device (e.g. smartphone) can also be displayed on your other devices (e.g. tablet or PC).
You can permanently object to cross-device remarketing/targeting by disabling personalised advertising in your Google account. The data is collected on the basis of the consent granted via your Google account. If data collection cannot be reconciled with your Google account settings, data is collected on the basis of Helsana’s legitimate interests in the anonymised analysis of Website visitors for advertising purposes.
5.2.6 Google Marketing Platform (formerly Double Click)
Helsana uses Google Marketing Platform (formerly DoubleClick), a web analytics service provided by Google, on its Websites. The platform optimises the interaction with Google Adwords by setting cookies when you view an advert or click on one of our advertising banners on a partner website. The aim is to show you banners that are more interesting to you. The cookie enables us to record certain data on the interaction between your browser and a particular display. It also records whether you looked at an advert, clicked on it and ultimately concluded a contract with Helsana via this channel. The information stored locally (user or client side) in the cookie about the use of our Websites is transferred to Google servers and saved there.
5.3 Friendly Captcha
We use the Friendly Captcha service on our Website. This service is provided by Friendly Captcha GmbH, Am Anger 3-5, 82237 Wörthsee, Germany. Friendly Captcha is an innovative, privacy-first protection solution that defends our Website against automated programs and scripts (bots). Data is used solely to protect the Website from spam and bots. Friendly Captcha does not store or read any cookies on the visitor’s device. IP addresses are only stored in hashed form (a one-way encryption method), meaning that neither we nor Friendly Captcha are able make any inferences about individuals’ identities. The basis for processing is our predominantly private and legitimate interest in protecting our Website against abuse by bots and hence against spam and attacks (e.g. flooding attacks). You can find further information about data protection in connection with the use of Friendly Captcha at

.
5.4 Social plug-ins
Our Websites use social media plug-ins, e.g. for Facebook, X (Twitter) or Google+ (providers). These plug-ins are labelled with the provider’s logo and can, for example, be a Like button, a Google+ button or a X (Twitter) button.
When you visit one of our Websites which contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection with the provider’s computers. The provider’s website sends the content of the plug-in directly to your browser, which incorporates it into the Website. Through the incorporation of the plug-in, the provider is informed that you visited our Website. If you are logged in to your account on the provider’s website at the same time, the provider can match the visit to your profile. If you interact with the plug-ins – for example by pressing the Like button or posting a comment – the corresponding information is sent by your browser directly to the provider and stored on their servers.
If you do not want the provider to collect data on you via our Website, you have to log out of your account on the provider’s website before visiting our Website. Even if you have logged out of your account, providers still collect data in anonymised form via the social plug-ins and set a cookie on your device. If you log in to your account on the provider’s website at a later date, this data can be linked to your profile.
If a login is offered via a social login service, e.g. Facebook Connect, data will be exchanged between the provider and our Website. In the case of Facebook Connect, this could be, for example, data from your public Facebook profile. By using such login services, you are agreeing to the transfer of your data.
Please see the provider’s privacy policy for the purpose and scope of the data collected and the further processing of your data by the provider, as well as your associated rights and configuration options to protect your privacy:

https://www.facebook.com/policy
For Google:

For X (formerly Twitter Inc.):

For Instagram:

5.5 Microsoft Advertising
Helsana uses the Microsoft Advertising service on this Website. When the service is used, Microsoft stores a cookie on your device if you access the Helsana Website via a Microsoft advert. By using Microsoft Advertising, Helsana can find out which campaigns have achieved which objectives. Only pseudonymous user profiles are created.
You can reject the setting of cookies and the processing of the data obtained by Microsoft. This can be done via the browser setting that generally disables the automatic setting of cookies. Further information about data protection and the cookies used by Microsoft.
5.6 Adjust
Helsana uses the Adjust analytics tool, a product from the company Adjust GmbH (Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405 Berlin, Germany). When users install a Helsana+ app (myHelsana, Helsana+, Helsana Coach), Adjust saves technical records relating to app installations and initial access to the Helsana+ app (e.g. use of the app or interactions in the user account, e.g. clicking on the individual menu items). The tool makes it possible to direct advertising in Google Adwords, DoubleClick, Facebook and X (Twitter) more specifically to user preferences.
Adjust bases its analyses on app users’ IP and MAC addresses, which are used by Helsana on an anonymised basis only. Users can revoke tracking by Adjust, and thus prevent targeted advertising, at any time by going to
https://www.adjust.com/forget-device/
. You can find further information on the Adjust data privacy policy at

6.1 Logging
When you read our e-mails, we record the time at which they are opened. We also record when you click on links or articles in the e-mail, which ones and whether you unsubscribe from further e-mail communications/newsletters.
6.2 Intended use of the data collected through logging
We use the data logged to present you with optimised content and offers in the future. Your data is used solely for the provision of services from the Helsana Group. When processing personal data, we comply with regulatory requirements, in particular the Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG).
The data logged will not be passed on to third parties.
6.3 Unsubscribing
You can unsubscribe from our e-mail communications/newsletters at any time. To do so, please refer to the instructions in the footer of every e-mail.
We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data collected via Websites against unauthorised processing, loss and destruction. We are also concerned about the confidentiality, availability and integrity of your personal data.
We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services available on the Website or for other processing purposes, such as fulfilling legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our policies. If we have a legal obligation to retain your personal data, we will delete it after expiry of the respective retention period.
Regardless of how we collect your personal data in connection with the Website, all Helsana Group companies have access to this personal data. This means that your personal data can also be processed for various purposes and linked together with personal data that is collected by another company of the Helsana Group.
Furthermore and to the extent permitted by applicable (data protection) law, Helsana may also disclose personal data to contracted service providers (both inside and outside Switzerland). In connection with data collected on the Website, these specifically consist of IT service providers working in the area of data storage and data analysis.
Personal data obtained in connection with the use of the Website may also be disclosed to third parties (inside or outside Switzerland) if we are obliged to do so by law, by court order or by official order or if this is necessary to support internal or external investigations, other legal investigations or proceedings in Switzerland or abroad or any corporate transactions.
We mainly process and store data in Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA), but in exceptional cases may potentially do so in any country in the world, for example through subcontractors of our service providers. If data is transferred to a country without adequate data protection, Helsana guarantees adequate protection through the use of sufficient contractual guarantees, specifically on the basis of EU Standard Contractual Clauses, binding corporate rules or based on exceptions with respect to consent, contract execution, the determination, exercise or enforcement of legal claims, overriding public interest, the data published by you or because it is necessary to protect your individual integrity. You may request a copy of the contractual guarantees by sending a written request along with a copy of an official form of identification to the contact address specified above (see Section 2) or find out from this contact where you can obtain such a copy. Helsana reserves the right to black out such copies for reasons of data protection or secrecy or to deliver only excerpts.
Profiling refers to the automated processing of personal data in order to analyse personal characteristics or produce forecasts. For example, profiling can be used to carry out analyses of personal interests, preferences, affinities or habits.
We do not generally carry out any profiling for the purposes of operating the Websites, except where you consent via the cookie banner to the use of web analytics tools (e.g. Adobe Analytics or Adobe Target). Unless you access the Website via a personalised link or invitation e-mail, your user activity itself is not personalised.
Your user activity on the Websites is evaluated in order to provide you with an individualised user experience along with offers and services that are tailored to your interests and preferences. If you do not accept the web analytics cookies, no profiling is carried out as your user activity is not recorded.
We do not use automated individual decision-making as defined in the applicable legal provisions for the purposes of operating the Website. Should we use these methods in individual cases, we will inform you separately if this is required by law.
Access to the Website and the related collection of connection data (such as IP addresses) must be logged; this happens automatically during use and cannot be disabled for individual users. With the exception of the data required for technical reasons (see Section 3.1 above), you are not obliged to provide us with any personal data in connection with your use of the Website. However, certain services cannot be used without the provision of personal data, or their functionality will be impaired.
Within the scope of the data protection law applicable to you, you have the right to access your data, to have it rectified or erased, the right to restrict data processing and otherwise to object to our data processing and to the disclosure of certain personal data for the purpose of transferring such personal data to another location (data portability). If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you may withdraw this consent at any time. Exercising these rights usually requires that you can clearly prove your identity. Please note, however, that we reserve the right to enforce the statutory restrictions, for example if we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have an overriding interest in it (insofar as we may invoke it) or need it for enforcing claims.
If Helsana makes an automated decision concerning an individual person that has a legal impact on the data subject or significantly affects them in a similar way, the data subject may speak to a competent person at Helsana and request a reconsideration of the decision, or demand that the matter be assessed by a competent person from the outset, to the extent provided for by law. In this case, the data subject might no longer be able to use certain automated services. The person will be informed of such decisions subsequently or separately in advance.
Every data subject has the right to file a complaint with the competent data protection authority. In Switzerland, this is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (
http://www.edoeb.admin.ch
).
You can also prevent or restrict the installation of cookies by changing your browser settings accordingly. However, we would like to point out that, in this case, you may not be able to use all the features of this Website to their full extent.
You can also take the following technical steps to prevent the automated data processing carried out on this Website:

If you do not want the provider of social plug-ins to collect data on you via our Website, you have to log out of your account on the provider’s website before visiting our Website. Even if you have logged out of your account, providers still collect data in anonymised form via the social plug-ins and set a cookie on your device. If you log in to your account on the provider’s website at a later date, this data can be linked to your profile.
Helsana may modify this Privacy Policy at any time without advance notice and without notification. The version currently published on the Website shall apply.
