This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our products and services or otherwise interact with us. “Attensi”, “we” and “us” refers to Attensi and each of our subsidiaries (
“Attensi”
).
Attensi complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679
(“GDPR”
) with respect to the processing and transfer of personal data.
This Privacy Policy also explains your choices surrounding how we use information about you, which include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you.

When you visit the website, we collect data through cookies as described in section 4 below. The data we collect through cookies consists of data relating to your device, IP address, and your use of the website. We use the data collected through cookies for the purposes of offering you the best user experience and for improving the website content by tracking usage patterns and recording preferences. See further information in section 4 below on how to accept and reject cookies by adjusting the settings in your browser.
1.2 When sending our newsletter
When you have been in dialogue with Attensi and/or your details have been provided as a contact point in a customer, partner, supplier or similar business relationship Attensi will collect your name and e-mail address in order to send you our newsletter. The purpose of the newsletter is to provide you with news, press releases and other relevant information from Attensi. You can stop receiving newsletters from us at any time by following the unsubscribe/opt-out instructions at the bottom of the newsletter that you receive.
1.3 When you contact us
When you contact us, for example for general enquiries or for general feedback via our website, we can collect personal data about you. The personal data can include your name, e-mail address and other information you wish to provide us with to respond to your comment or enquiry. If you register to one of our events, we can collect information about your name, contact information or similar information.
The legal basis for this processing is that the processing is necessary for fulfilling a contract with you or for taking steps prior to entering into contract, or that it is in our legitimate interest to meet your request and to improve our business and services and these interests are not overridden by your rights to data protection.
1.4 For recruitment
When you apply for a job through the website, we use a job application portal operated by an external service provider on our behalf, for processing and handling your job application. When you apply for a job, we collect your name, contact information, CV, education level, competencies and skills, career and work experiences. If relevant, you may also provide us with social security number, job certificates, references, and other relevant background information.
We use this information to determine your eligibility for the job that you apply for by assessing whether you are the ideal candidate for the position in question.
With your consent, we may also retain your data for the purposes of identifying you as a potential candidate for future suitable vacancies and/or to inform you of future suitable vacancies. If there are no suitable jobs listed on our website, you can also upload your CV to our job application portal for future opportunities. Your candidate profile will be visible to our recruiters and we will contact you should a suitable vacancy arise.
The legal basis for processing and storing your job application, CV and related information is your consent and that the processing is necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. You can withdraw your consent or update your information at any time through your user profile.
1.5  Customer, supplier and partner management and support
Attensi processes business-related data on customers, suppliers and partners, and their employees, to support and manage those relationships (internal/external), to provide products and services to third parties, for protection of business interests and for conducting and securing business operations, e.g., to secure and verify accounts and activity, respond to potential or actual security incidents, monitor and protect against other malicious, fraudulent og illegal activity, protect our legal rights and interest, compliance, regulatory and audit functions. The legal basis for this processing is Attensi’s legitimate business interests in ensuring good management and support for customers, suppliers, partners and third parties, and to comply with legal and contractual obligations.
1.6 Due diligence
In connection with our business activity, we may perform a due diligence process of business partners. This work may include obtaining personal statements, non-disclosure agreements and background checks and security assessments of employees in the relevant company.
Personal data includes name, gender, position and other publicly available information which we deem necessary for the due diligence.
The legal basis for our processing of personal data in a due diligence process is our legitimate interest in verifying our business partners and maintaining the necessary levels of quality and security in our processes, services, deliveries and premises.
1.7 Compliance with legal obligations and information relating to legal proceedings
Attensi may process personal data necessary to comply with legal obligations, for example tax and accounting information and information relating to legal proceedings. The purpose and legal basis for this processing is Attensi’s legal obligations and Attensi s legitimate interests in the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
2. SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA
We may share your personal data within Attensi when necessary to fulfil a request from you, or for entering into an employment contract with you, or in other circumstances where sharing is necessary in order to meet your inquiry.
We do not share your personal data with third parties except where such sharing is necessary to provide services. We use external third-party service providers for example for operating the job application portal (see section 1.4), for website hosting, for processing transactions and for performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only share your personal data with the service providers to the extent it is necessary for them to deliver the services.
Any sharing of personal data is subject to the GDPR.
In the event that we sell or buy any business or asset, we may disclose your personal data to such prospective buyers or sellers. Moreover, Attensi may share your personal data with public authorities or governments if required by mandatory law.
3. TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA
Attensi will not transfer personal data to a third country outside of the EEA that does not provide adequate protection of personal data unless appropriate safeguards are implemented, or the transfer otherwise takes place in accordance with applicable data protection legislation, e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
