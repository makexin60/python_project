Daily Dictionary respects your privacy.
The app collects minimal data, only storing what it needs to support its features. For instance, we store an anonymous token for every client device which uses the app. Settings such as notification preferences are then associated with this token.
For subscription billing, we use Apple's iTunes merchant processing. We do not see your account or payment information.
