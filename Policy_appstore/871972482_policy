11.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION
a
.
Mandatory Arbitration.
Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND Blade AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit
www.adr.org
for more information about arbitration.
i. Commencing Arbitration
. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Blade, to you via any other method available to Blade, including via e-mail. The Notice to Blade should be addressed to BLADE Urban Air Mobility, Inc., 31 Hudson Yards, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10001, Attn: General Counsel (the “Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice must (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific relief sought (the “Demand”). If you and Blade do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Blade may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (the “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Blade, then Blade will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Blade’s receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.
ii. Arbitration Proceeding
. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. A single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and Blade agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
iii. No Class Actions
. YOU AND BLADE AGREE THAT YOU AND Blade MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.
iv. Decision of the Arbitrator
. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of New York in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in this Agreement.
b. Equitable Relief
. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which Blade seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Blade or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Blade, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.
c. Claims
. You and Blade agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
d. Improperly Filed Claims
. All claims you bring against Blade must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section will be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, Blade may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that Blade has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
e. Modifications
. In the event that Blade makes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration provision (other than a change to Blade’s Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Blade’s Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with Blade and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Dispute Resolution provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this Agreement.
f. Enforceability
. If only Section 10.a.iii or the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 10 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.
12. Governing Law
.
The laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern this Agreement . Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws. To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York, and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.

You may not assign this Agreement or any of the rights or licenses granted hereunder, directly or indirectly, including by sale, merger, change of control, operation of law, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Blade.

BLADE PASSPORT PROGRAM
Certain Flights are eligible for the Blade Passport Program (the “Program”). The Program allows a participant to receive a discount in exchange for purchasing a certain number of Flights. Flights may be used one at a time or in any number by different passengers. NOTE: U.S. DOT REGULATIONS REQUIRE PUBLIC CHARTER FLIGHT PAYMENTS TO BE ESCROWED ON A PER-PASSENGER, PER-FLIGHT BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, PURCHASER MUST, AT THE TIME OF PAYMENT, RESERVE EACH FUTURE FLIGHT DESIRED AND MUST INCLUDE ALL PASSENGER NAMES FOR RESERVATIONS ON EACH FLIGHT DESIRED.
FLIGHTTILT
If you are purchasing seats on a flight deemed “UNCONFIRMED” OR “PROPOSED”:
Your flight will become confirmed once the designated number of seats required to confirm the flight are purchased. A hold equal to the total amount of your order will be placed on your credit card after checking out. You will only be charged if the minimum number of seats required to confirm the flight are purchased. If the minimum number of seats required to confirm the flight are not purchased, the hold on your credit card will be released. You may cancel your seat(s) without penalty and receive a refund only if the flight is not confirmed. By completing your order, you authorize BLADE Urban Air Mobility, Inc. to charge your credit card for the total order value displayed once the flight is confirmed.
Once your flight is confirmed, your order may not be cancelled or changed. Any cancellation or change after the flight is confirmed will result in a full forfeiture of your total order value. Similarly, failure to (i) show up, (ii) arrive at least 15 minutes prior to departure in possession of valid government issued identification, or (iii) board the aircraft when instructed to, will result in a full forfeiture of your total order value.

COOKIES
What are cookies?
We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on Services.
We use two broad categories of cookies:
(1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits Services; and

Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customize.

Your site and user data are safe with Hotjar. There are a number of steps we take to ensure you are the only person who can access your site data and that your users' privacy is respected.
Data Safety, Privacy & Security
Expand All
Data storage
User and usage data that Hotjar collects through its software is stored in Ireland, European Union (EU) on the Amazon Web Services infrastructure, eu-west-1 data centers. Our application and database servers run inside an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Access to the VPC is limited to Hotjar team members on a need-to-know basis. Data stores within the VPC are not directly exposed to the internet. Only systems with a direct technical need are exposed (e.g. frontend web servers, load balancers, and other systems, which directly serve customer traffic).
Hotjar has designated
sub-processors
, some of which are located outside of the EU. These designated sub-processors are used by Hotjar to ensure reliable service for our users. It includes infrastructure and application monitoring as well as other business support operations.
User privacy
Site users are assigned a unique user identifier, UUID, so that Hotjar can keep track of returning users without relying on any personal information, such as the IP address.
No end-user IP addresses are stored at rest
.
IP Addresses can optionally be passed to Hotjar as a User Attribute
In the case of IP addresses passed to Hotjar via the
Identify API
, IP addresses will be stored. They are subject to the same privacy requirements as any other personal information passed to Hotjar. This includes requiring user consent, and for you to have accepted our
Data Processing Agreement
.
When collecting data with Recordings, Hotjar automatically
suppresses keystroke data on all input fields
. In all cases, the data is suppressed client-side, the user's browser, which means it never reaches our servers.
Data collection & transmission
Firewalls are in place exposing only the necessary ports through the internet and between different servers. Intrusion protection system (IPS) software is in place as a second layer of security, which will block access as soon as any suspicious login activity is detected.
Hotjar transmits data from the user's browser to our system using HTTPS.
The protocols and ciphers suite used to encrypt data in transit are available at the end of this article.
Data access & authentication
Only Hotjar engineers who require such access to perform their job efficiently are given this type of access. Different engineers are given different access rights on different system components as well depending on what their job requires. Engineers who do have access, have their own credentials and these are only valid when used from specific IPs. SSH Key-Based authentication is used for server access.
Data collected through Hotjar is exclusively reserved for use by our users and customers. Hotjar does not make use of the data collected in any form or way unless consent is officially given by an admin of the Hotjar account, clearly outlining what the data will be used for.
Data access & backup
At Hotjar we use Database replication to keep your data safe in the case of system failure. Full database backups are taken every day, stored on Amazon Cloud Storage (AWS S3), and kept for three days as an electronic copy. In case two or more database nodes would fail concurrently we would have to revert to a backup.
Data back up does not apply to User Recordings
All Recording data is currently not backed up. Hotjar utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) where our client data resides. Certifications and audit reports for AWS are:
Compliances, Certificates, & Audits
ISO-27001 Certification for AWS:

Hotjar has completed a self-assessment process (SAQ-A) that permits us to accept card-not-present payments by fully outsourcing all cardholder data functions to our PCI-DSS compliant third-party vendor, Braintree, with no electronic storage, processing or transmission of any cardholder data on Hotjars infrastructure.

Updating your Privacy Policy for use with Hotjar
As a company based in the European Union, our technology and processes adhere to the strictest legal privacy requirements. In fact, we engaged a specialized law firm to assist us with the process of drafting a policy that is suitable for us, as well as for Hotjar users around the world.
While we always recommend you seek legal advice within your territory, we suggest you review the provisions of our Privacy Policy and ensure your own policy mirrors the same principles we have included at
https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy
