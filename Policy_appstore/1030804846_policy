On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content, including by forwarding them a copy of the Notice and the name and email address of the person submitting the Notice, so that a Counter Notice may be filed. On receiving a valid Counter Notice, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.
Please note: The DMCA provides that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you falsely claim that content is infringing your copyright. We recommend contacting an attorney if you are unsure whether your content is protected by copyright law or whether content is infringing on your copyright.

Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;
Statements by you that: (a) you have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above and contained on the service is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by protection of law; and that (b) you swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; and
A physical signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf. To satisfy the signature requirement, please designate electronic signatures by typing a forward slash before and after your name (e.g., /Jane Doe/).
