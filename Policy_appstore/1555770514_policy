Last Update Date : 28 Apr 2021
THIS PRIVACY POLICY EXPLAINS WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED, HOW THIS IS DONE, WHAT IS IT USED FOR, AND TO WHOM Blur Video (HENCEFORTH REFERRED TO AS THE APP), HONK HONK PUNCH PTY LTD DISCLOSES THIS INFORMATION AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES.
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the «last updated» date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect about You :
We don’t have a Registration/Login Process, so we don’t store any personal information on our server.
We Collect Only your email name when you decide to email our developers for Feedback/Bug Report/New Features Request. We collect that information to solve bugs or improve our service. The email will be used for contacting you to improve our service. We will never use that information for any other purpose, such as to further market our products, or to disclose your personal information to a third party for commercial gains.
Permission :
The app will ask you for permission before using the application. Below are details of that permission:
1) Camera Access:
Users can take a photo with phone camera and edit.
2) Photo Library Access:
Users can choose photos from the photo library and save after editing.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
We take reasonable security measures to protect the information that we obtain from you (including preventing the loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of your personal information). However, please be aware that unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, hacking, the inherent insecurity of the Internet and other factors, may compromise the security of your personal information at any time. As such, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information, and we will have no liability to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse or alteration.
INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES
We share collected non-personally identifiable information with third parties, third party advertising providers and other third party service providers (collectively referred to as “Partners”).
We may share information that can be used to personally identify your device (e.g. persistent identifiers such as Installation UUID and IP address) for the purposes of delivering our services, displaying appropriate advertisements.
We use a service called Crashlytics to provide details of any crashes that occur when running the app. Crashlytics records the Installation UUID of the device which is "An alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies a device to the app’s vendor." This means that all of our apps installed on one device have this same ID. This is used so we can see the distribution of a crash. For example if we get the same crash 100 times, did those 100 crashes happen on 100 different devices? Or maybe just on 7 devices? If on 7 devices then we know that the crash is happening over and over for the same people. This doesn't tell us who you are, or where you are or anything like that, but it is crucial to our understanding of how a bug occurs so we can fix it and provide you the bug free experience you deserve.
To get more information about how your data is being collected and processed you can visit the sites at:

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may update, change or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the «last updated» date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our app will signify your acceptance of these changes.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
