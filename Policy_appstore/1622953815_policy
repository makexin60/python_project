support@rently.com
to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
Data Security
All location data is securely stored using technology and security features that safeguard the privacy of your location information, including:
• Maintaining and protecting the security of computer storage and network equipment;
• Security procedures that require user names and passwords to access sensitive data;
• Applying encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect location information when stored or transmitted by us;
• Limiting access to location information to only those with jobs requiring such access.
Background Location Data
We may collect approximate location data from a user’s mobile device. We collect this data to enable specific features and for security reasons. We only use location services data when it is directly relevant to the features and services provided by the Services. For example, we access location data from your mobile device when you take a self-guided tour. You are unable to conduct a self-guided tour if we cannot collect geolocation data due to your device and app settings. You must also turn off all VPNs to obtain access to a property for a self-guided tour. Location data is not provided, resold, or remarketed to third parties.
Video Doorbell Data
Rently’s smart home technology includes doorbell video cameras (“Video Doorbells”). Video Doorbells detect motion near their location (an “Event”). Video footage of the Event is stored locally on the Video Doorbell’s SD card.  Photo footage of the Event is stored in the cloud of our Video Doorbell vendor. Only the residents occupying the home where the Video Doorbell is used can access the stored Event recordings. Rently does not have access to stored Event recordings.
When the resident vacates the property, we ensure that their Event video and photo recordings are not accessible to new residents. Event recordings will also be deleted if the resident manually reformats the SD card or performs a hard reset of the Video Doorbell.
Rently does not use Event data for facial recognition purposes or for the purpose of identifying an individual.
Access Panel Data
Properties that utilize Rently’s smart home technology may use a Rently access panel with video intercom capabilities (the “Access Panel”). When individuals visit a property and interact with an Access Panel to call a resident or enter the building, a photo will be taken of the individual. Photos may be shared with the property or law enforcement for security purposes. Rently will not use or share such photos for any other purpose. Rently is not responsible for use of the photo by a property or by law enforcement.
Children Under the Age of 13
Our Website and Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Website, register on the Website, use the Services, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at

Right to Know and Data Portability
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months (the “right to know”). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Your Rights to Know, Correct, or Delete), we will disclose to you:
• The categories of personal information we collected about you.
• The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
• Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.
• The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.

Right to Correct
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal data we maintain about you.
Right to Delete
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions (the “right to delete”). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Your Rights to Know, Correct, or Delete), we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
We will delete or deidentify personal information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records and will direct our service providers to take similar action.
Exercising Your Rights to Know, Correct, or Delete
To exercise your rights to know, correct, or delete described above, please submit a request by either:
• Calling us at 888-659-9596
• Emailing us at
support@rently.com
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know, correct, or delete related to your personal information.  You may also make a request to know, correct, or delete on behalf of your child.
You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know, correct, or delete must:
• Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
• Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.
Response Timing and Format
We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact 888-659-9596 or
support@rently.com
.
We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
• Deny you goods or services.
• Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
• Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
• Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
