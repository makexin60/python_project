If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

.
8. SECURITY
We employ appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and although we employ appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information sent over the internet.
You are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. Nobody at Goodlord will ever ask you for your password, be careful not to share this with anyone.
9. DATA RETENTION
We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes it was collected for (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal tax or accounting obligations).
When we no longer need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
10. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
Our servers are situated in Dublin, Ireland; however we collect data from wherever users are situated. Our third party service providers operate in countries around the world, including US. This means that we may process the personal information we collect in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards as required by law to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
11. YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS
You have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact information provided under the ''Contacting us'' heading above. We may also require you to provide us with appropriate identification before we comply with this request. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request to delete personal information for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
In addition, in certain circumstances you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting us” heading above.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time by following any “unsubscribe” link included in the marketing emails which we send to you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting us” heading above.
Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Our team (
privacy@goodlord.co
) is on hand to address any queries and concerns you may have. If for some reason you are not satisfied with the way these have been handled, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (
www.ico.org.uk
) about our collection and use of your personal information.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
