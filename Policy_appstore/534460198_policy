Your fitness data is securely stored in a local, private database on your device and is only shared with external services when you explicitly choose to do so via the app's share and export features.
You will always remain anonymous, and no account or data is stored on our servers.
Any data shared with external services will be subject to that service's privacy policy and any agreements you have with them.
For some services that do not offer modern APIs, login credentials (username and password) are required. These credentials are stored securely in your iOS Keychain on your device and are transmitted securely (encrypted).
Non-identifiable usage analytics are collected through Google Analytics to monitor performance and enhance the app. Google retains user-level and event-level data for up to 14 months.
In summary: We do not store any of your data, and you do not have an account with us.
