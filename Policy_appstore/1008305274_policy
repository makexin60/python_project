Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website or use an online service. When you visit the website or use the service again, the cookie allows that website or online service to recognize your browser or device. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information.
We may use “session cookies” or “persistent cookies.” Session cookies are temporary and expire once you close your browser or once your session ends. Persistent cookies remain on your device for much longer or until you or your browser erase them. Persistent cookies have varying durations that are dependent on their expiration date.

We may place cookies on your device. To identify one page request from another, this site uses a common technique called "HTTP-header cookies." These cookies do not contain any personal information. They indicate that a page request is from someone who has already visited the site. Your browser may be set up to warn you whenever a site sends your browser a cookie.

We also use cookies and other data collection tools, such as pixels, to help improve your experience with the Site.
Web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to manage and delete cookies, visit

Web Beacons and Pixels
A pixel is an HTML code snippet embedded in a website or email that collects information about user behaviors and interactions with the website or email.
We may utilize pixels both on certain aspects of the Site and in HTML-formatted email messages to you. Pixels may be used for the purpose of, among other things, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns, compiling statistics about Site usage and tracking the activities of users of the Site and email recipients. For instance, we may use pixels from Meta and Google on the Site to enable us to create targeted advertisements and measure the effectiveness of our advertisements. For additional information on interest-based advertising, please see Section 2 (Interest-Based Advertising).
We may use the following pixels on our site:
2. Interest Based Advertising
We may collect information about your online activities on our Site to provide you with advertising about products tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our advertisements are served.
You may see certain advertisements on other websites because we work with advertising partners (including advertising networks) to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities. Our advertising partners allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. These partners track your online activities over time and across websites, including our Site, by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies and web beacons. They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For example, we utilize certain of our advertising partners’ targeted advertising services to show you our advertisements on other websites based on your prior visits to our Site and other online activity.
Provided that a company participates in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising, you may opt out of interest-based advertising generally through the Network Advertising Initiative website or by visiting
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
(web-based advertising) or
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
(for mobile advertising). To learn more, please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance at
www.networkadvertising.org/choices
. Opting-out does not mean that you will stop receiving advertisements from us. It means that you will stop receiving advertisements from us that have been targeted to you based on your visits and browsing activity across websites over time.
