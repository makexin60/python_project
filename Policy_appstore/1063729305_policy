Privacy Policy
Welcome to BlueMail, a messaging platform that integrates best-of-breed
email, calendar, contacts, and later board for improved team-driven
productivity (the "Platform" and the "Service").
This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how information about
you is collected and used by the Platform developed and operated by
Blix, Inc. ("Blix" or "we", "us", "our").
We are committed to protecting and respecting data privacy. As explained
below, we do not store your emails on our servers, and we do not sell your data.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
PERSONAL DATA PROCESSED
We process your email address. We also optionally process your name or
nickname, photo, and mobile phone number.
We process your email address when you register to use BlueMail.
You may also optionally provide the following items when you register:
A chosen name, nickname, or pseudonym to be displayed with your email
account.
A photo used as your avatar.
Your mobile phone number for SMS verification.
We also generate a unique app instance number when you install and run
an instance of our client-side app on your smartphone, desktop, laptop,
and web browser. It is generated anew if you reinstall our app. We do
not use any hardware identifiers such as Unique Device Identifier
(UDID), SSAID (Android ID), IDFA, GAID, or IMEI, and we have no way to
track the specific hardware you use.
We refer to this as
"Registration Information"
.
We process your account preferences, such as background color, font, and email signature.
We process your account settings, including the background color you have chosen, the refresh rate and font settings you selected, and the automatic email signature you configured.
We refer to this as
"Account Settings Information"
.
We process billing information using BlueMail's fee-based plans.
We process payment information, such as credit card details, that we
may collect from the administrator of an organization or from users who make purchases. This data is securely handled by certified payment processors and not stored directly by Blix.
We refer to this as
"Billing Information"
.
When you use or access groups through the Platform, we process the
group's conversation settings, which include the email addresses of the
group members as well as other settings.
When you use or access groups through the Platform, we process the
email addresses of the group members as well as the group's selected
name, avatar, and notes.
We refer to this as
"Group Conversation Settings"
.
We will process your email credentials in certain cases.
If you use Windows, Mac, or Linux: We do not process your credentials or
OAuth tokens.
If you use a mobile device: If you configure your account settings to allow instant
push notifications when you have a new email and use OAuth-supported
email accounts on Android, or IMAP and Exchange email accounts on iOS,
we will process either the OAuth token or encrypted credentials.
We refer to this as
"Credential Information"
.
We will process user inquiries you choose to send us.
You can submit an inquiry through our online "Contact Us" form or by
emailing or writing to us. We will collect the information you provide
in the inquiry, which typically includes your name, email address, other
contact information, country, and the text of your message.
We refer to this as
"Inquiry Information"
.
We will process user feedback and reviews you provide.
You can provide us feedback, reviews, or answers to surveys or
promotions, on social media channels, by posting on any of our online
public forums or communities, by sending an e-mail to any of our
designated addresses, or any other form of communication. We will
process the data you choose to provide, which may include your name,
email address, and the feedback or review.
We refer to this as
"Feedback Information"
.
In the provision of the Service, the Platform performs limited
processing of your emails, later board, contacts, and calendar events.
In order to provide the Service to you, the Platform is involved in
processing your emails, later board, contacts, and calendar events, but
in a very limited fashion as described below.
We refer to this as
"Your Content"
.
You do not have a legal obligation to let us process any of the above
information. However, you will not be able to use the Platform and the
Service unless we process this information because we require it to
operate the Platform and provide you with the Service.
We collect and process measurements regarding your use of the
Platform.
We collect metadata such as the frequency of your use of the
Platform, your interaction with the Platform's user interface, general
details such as the model of your smartphone and its operating system,
and information about bugs and crashes in our client-side app on your
smartphone, desktop, laptop, and web browser.
We refer to this entire dataset as
"Analytics Information"
.
HOW YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED
We will not share your information with third parties, except in the
events listed below or when you provide us with your explicit and informed
consent.
We will process your information to provide you the functionality of
the Service.
We store and use your Registration Information, Account Settings
Information, Credential Information, and Group Conversation Settings to
provide the functionality of the Platform.
We use your Billing Information to charge the fees applicable to your
organization's use of the Platform or for your in-app purchases. Payment
processors handle data securely, and we do not store credit card details.
We do not store your email messages or calendar events on our servers.
If you use an iOS device or an Android device with an OAuth-compliant account, and
have configured your account on the Service to send you instant push
notifications of new incoming emails, our servers will momentarily process portions of each incoming email message. The Platform's push proxy receives emails and within 1-2 seconds pushes them to the device's push service, after which the emails are automatically and completely deleted from the
Platform's servers.
If you use the Service's spam filter, our servers will momentarily process information about the sender of incoming email messages to determine if the message is believed to be spam. If you tag an email message as spam, we will store the sender's email address in order to keep flagging it as spam.
If you use the optional Share feature, you can share a link to a specific email by uploading it to our servers. You can then send it to any of your contacts.
If you use the optional GemAI (Generative Email) feature, the relevant email will be temporarily processed by our servers and subsequently transferred to a generative AI service provider for a response. We will not retain the email information and its response and will use it solely for the purpose of facilitating AI services.
If you use the optional Convo feature, you have the option to include other members. Should you choose to do so, an automatic email notification is sent to these members. This email informs the recipients that they can view and participate in a Convo created by you. The content within your Convo, whether it's a solo endeavor or a collaborative effort, is uploaded and stored on our servers to ensure accessibility and functionality. By default, your Convo is private. If other members are included, they can gain access to all the content of the Convo.
Our Platform's servers store your later boards (excluding the email message attached to the task, which we do not store). These are all stored in an encrypted form, which you can read more about below.
We will use the Inquiry Information to handle and respond to your inquiry for quality assurance and for the development and enhancement of the Platform, to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and for related purposes.
We will use your Inquiry Information to contact you about your inquiry and to handle and respond to it. If your inquiry relates to any other information we have about you, we will process that information to respond to your inquiry.
We may also use the content of your inquiry to maintain and improve the
Service, for quality assurance and for the development and enhancement of
the Platform, to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems,
assist with any investigations, and enforce our terms of use for the
Platform.
We use the Analytics Information and your Feedback Information for our
business needs of developing and enhancing the Service, preventing fraud,
resolving disputes, and troubleshooting problems and related purposes.
We process the Analytics Information and Feedback Information to
maintain and improve the Service, for quality assurance, and for the
development and enhancement of the Platform.
We will also use the Analytics Information and Feedback Information to
prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
investigations, and enforce our terms of use for the Platform.
If you expressed your consent, we will use your email address to
contact you with marketing messages, promotions, and offers relating to
the Platform and the Service.
We will use your email address to send you emails containing BlueMail
updates, promotions, marketing, and special offers. We will only do so
if you have given your consent. If you gave your consent but later wish
to unsubscribe from these emails, you may opt-out of receiving them by
following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each
communication or by emailing us at
privacy@bluemail.me
.
We will use your email address to contact you with administrative
messages relating to the Platform, the Service, this privacy policy, and
our terms of use.
We will use your email address to initiate contact with you on
administrative issues related to the Services or support and
maintenance.
We will process information with our service providers helping us to
operate our business.
We will process personal information with the assistance of our
service providers who assist us with the internal operations of the
Service. These companies, which include Amazon Web Services, Google, DigitalOcean, OpenAI, and Stripe, are authorized to use your
personal information in this context only as necessary to provide these
services to us and not for their own business purposes.
We will share information with competent authorities if you violate
any applicable law.
If you violated any applicable law, we may share information we have
about you with competent authorities and with third parties (such as
legal counsels and advisors), for the purpose of handling the
violation.
We will share your information if we are legally required.
We will share information we have about you if we are required to do
so by a judicial, governmental, or regulatory authority.
We will share your information with third parties in any event of a
change in our structure.

framework, or through another legal structure or entity (such as due to
a merger or acquisition), we will share information only as required to
enable the structural change in the operation of the business.
COOKIES
What are cookies?
Cookies are text files, comprised of small amounts of data, that are
saved on your computer or other device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, etc.)
when you use the internet and visit various websites.
The information that the cookies maintain is read by the website you
visit, during the session of your visit to the website (these are called
'session' cookies), and when you return to visit it again (these are
called 'persistent' cookies).
We use cookies necessary to operate the Platform and for measurement
of analytics.
We use cookies for a number of purposes, as briefly explained below:
Necessary.
We use a login cookie to validate your login credentials
when you use login to the Platform through the web. This cookie is
strictly necessary for the functioning of the Platform. The Platform
cannot operate properly without this cookie.
Statistics.
Google Analytics cookies that help us understand how you
interact with the Platform by collecting data that does not directly
identify you.
You can always delete or disable cookies.

BLUEMAIL MAILBOX
For users of the optional BlueMail Mailbox feature, please refer to the dedicated annex:
BlueMail Mailbox Privacy Policy
.
SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION
We will generally retain your information for as long as you are a
registered user, and thereafter for record-keeping purposes if
necessary.
Generally, we will retain your information for as long as you are a
registered user of the Platform. Except as required by law or our
agreement directly with you, we are not obliged to retain your
information for any particular period, and we are free to securely
delete it or restrict access to it for any reason and at any time, with
or without notice to you.
We will also retain and use your information in the following instances:
Keep evidence to our compliance with applicable law (for instance,
records of consents to our terms of use, privacy policy, and other
similar consents are kept for five years).
If there is an outstanding issue, claim, or dispute requiring us to
keep the relevant information until it is resolved.
The information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such
as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For
example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was
banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new
account.
We implement measures to secure your information.
We implement measures to reduce the risks of damage, loss of information
and unauthorized access or use of information. These include TLS and AES
encryption for data in transit and encryption such as for the later board,
when they are stored on our servers. In any event, these measures do not
provide absolute information security. Therefore, although efforts are
made to secure personal information, it is not guaranteed, and you
cannot expect that the Service will be immune from information security
risks.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
We will internationally transfer information in accordance with
applicable data protection laws.
If we transfer your personal data for processing at locations outside
your jurisdiction, we will abide by data transfer rules applicable to
these situations.
