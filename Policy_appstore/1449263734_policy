Certain online information about you or device information may originate from the use of cookies and similar technologies (for example, pixel tags and device identifiers) on our sites or sites of third parties. For more information on cookies and similar technologies, please see

5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We may use personal information for the following business purposes:
to communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle;
to create and administer an Oracle single sign-on (SSO) account (also referred to as an ‘Oracle Account’) and to deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management;
to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process orders for Oracle products and services;
to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services;
to manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems; and
to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
We may use personal information for the following commercial purposes:
to administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters;
to market our products and services or related products and services, and to tailor our marketing and sales activities to your or your company’s interests; and
to provide select business-to-business services to Oracle customers using publicly available information about companies which may include personal information such as the name of a company’s CEO that is publicly available.
These purposes are described below in further detail.
To communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle
If you get in touch with us (such as by submitting contact forms on our sites, reaching out to us via Oracle Sales chat, attending Oracle events or other occasions, sending an email or by visiting social media platforms), we process information about you to communicate with you and to respond to your requests or other inquiries. We can also process personal information to interact with you on third party social networks.
To create an Oracle SSO account and deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management
When you choose to register with us (such as to make use of our communities), we need to process the personal information provided by you so that we can create an Oracle account for you. Please note, this only applies to personal information controlled by Oracle, not personal information Oracle processes on behalf of our customers.
To engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process purchases of our products and services
If you place an order for our products and services, or if you provide services to Oracle, our employees, customers or partners as a supplier or business partner, Oracle processes information about you to engage in and administer the relevant transactions (such as by sending invoices and making payments), administer your order, and help you get started and adopt our products and services (e.g., by contacting you to activate your Cloud services credits). If you download products or services from our sites, Oracle uses information about you to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you did not experience problems in the download process).
To analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services
We may process personal information in order to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, including for quality assurance and training purposes, as well as for marketing and sales campaigns. This includes processing personal information to conduct surveys to improve Oracle products and services. In case the sites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, create a profile, post comments, opportunities or other content, or communicate directly with another user or otherwise engage in networking activities on Oracle sites, Oracle may process personal information when moderating these activities.
To manage the security of our sites, facilities, networks and systems
We may collect site use data for security and operations management to help keep our sites, facilities, networks and systems secure, or to investigate and prevent potential fraud, including ad fraud and cyber-attacks and to detect bots.
To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business
In some cases, we have to process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process personal information in the performance and operation of our business, such as to conduct internal audits and investigations or for finance and accounting and archiving and insurance purposes.
To administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters
If you subscribe to our magazines (such as “Oracle” or “Profit”), we process information about you to administer your subscription to our magazines (including the renewal process) and newsletters.
To market our products, services, events, or related products and services and to tailor marketing and sales activities
Oracle may use information about you to notify you about new product releases and service developments, events, alerts, updates, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns and promotions (including via newsletters). Oracle may also use personal information to advertise Oracle’s products and services or related products and services, and also to have our distributors, resellers or partners notify you about our products or services or their related products or services (such as via joint sales or product promotions). We do our best to tailor your website visit, marketing experience and our communications to your expressed interests. This happens, for example, if you sign up for an Oracle community or program like the Oracle Partner Network or Oracle Technology Network.
If you attend an event, Oracle may process information about you gathered in relation to the event and can share information about your attendance with your company. Oracle may also permit designated event partners or conference sponsors to send you up to two communications related to your event attendance. Please note that our partners or conference sponsors may directly request information about you at their conference booths or presentations, and their use of your information that you provide to them will be subject to their privacy policies.
We may also process your personal information to post testimonials on our sites, but will first obtain your consent to use your name and testimonial.
To provide select services to Oracle customers using publicly-available information which may include personal information such as the name of a company’s CEO
For some business-to-business services, we may collect the publicly available names of company directors and officials to better understand the status of these companies and help inform our services which relate to providing customers information about other companies.
6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?
For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, the UK and other relevant jurisdictions, our basis for processing is the following:

Contact information such as your email address or phone number collected online on our sites or offline from our interactions with you at Oracle events and conferences, and used for direct marketing and sales activities will be retained for as long as we have an active (customer) relationship with you. We treat you as an active contact if (i) you have interacted with Oracle or updated your contact details and preferences in the past 18 months; and (ii) you have not made a deletion request.
If you have reached out to us via Oracle Sales chat, we will delete all chat transcripts 90 days after the chat has concluded.
If you have reached out to us via our support line and you have not opted out of call recording, we will delete call recordings 60 days after the call has concluded unless otherwise specified during the call.
If you have visited an Oracle facility, the personal information needed to allow you to enter the facility will be held for one year after your last visit for records retention purposes.
Personal information needed to retain your opt-out preferences is retained for 20 years (or longer as necessary to comply with applicable law).

The definitions of Services Personal Information and Systems Operations Data do not include Your or User
contact and related information
collected from the use of Oracle websites, or Your or User interactions with us during the contracting process. Oracle’s handling of this information is subject to the terms of the
General Oracle Privacy Policy
.
I. SERVICES PERSONAL INFORMATION DATA PROCESSING TERMS
Oracle treats all Services Personal Information in accordance with the terms of Sections I and III of this Policy and Your order for Services.
In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Services Privacy Policy and any privacy terms incorporated into Your order for Services, including an Oracle Data Processing Agreement, the relevant privacy terms of Your order for Services shall take precedence.
1. Purpose of Processing Services Personal Information
Oracle may process Services Personal Information for the processing activities necessary to perform the Services, including for creating an Oracle services account to access Oracle products and services, for testing and applying new product or system versions, patches, updates and upgrades, and resolving bugs and other issues You have reported to Oracle.
2. Customer instructions
You are the controller of the Services Personal Information processed by Oracle to perform the Services. Oracle will process your Services Personal Information as specified in Your Services order and Your documented additional written instructions to the extent necessary for Oracle to (i) comply with its processor obligations under applicable data protection law or (ii) assist You to comply with Your controller obligations under applicable data protection law relevant to Your use of the Services. Oracle will promptly inform You if, in our reasonable opinion, Your instruction infringes applicable data protection law. You acknowledge and agree that Oracle is not responsible for performing legal research and/or for providing legal advice to You. Additional fees may apply.
3. Rights of individuals
You control access to Your Services Personal Information by Your end users, and Your end users should direct any requests related to their Services Personal Information to You. To the extent such access is not available to You, Oracle will provide reasonable assistance with requests from individuals to access, delete or erase, restrict, rectify, receive and transmit, block access to or object to processing of Services Personal Information on Oracle systems. If Oracle directly receives any requests or inquiries from Your end users that have identified You as the controller, we will promptly pass on such requests to You without responding to the end user.
If you are an end user and you have questions about your choices regarding the disclosure and use of Services Personal Information provided to Oracle, please consult directly with the organization that collected your information from you.
4. Security and confidentiality
Oracle has implemented and will maintain technical and organizational measures designed to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Services Personal Information. These measures, which are generally aligned with the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard, govern all areas of security applicable to the Services, including physical access, system access, data access, transmission, input, security oversight, and enforcement.
Oracle employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of personal information. Employees’ obligations include written confidentiality agreements, regular training on information protection, and compliance with company policies concerning protection of confidential information.
See
additional details
regarding the specific security measures that apply to the Services are set out in the security practices for these Services, including regarding data retention and deletion, available for review.
5. Incident Management and data breach notification.
Oracle promptly evaluates and responds to incidents that create suspicion of or indicate unauthorized access to or handling of Services Personal Information.
If Oracle becomes aware and determines that an incident involving Services Personal Information qualifies as a breach of security leading to the misappropriation or accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Services Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed on Oracle systems that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of such Services Personal Information, Oracle will report such breach to You without undue delay.
As information regarding the breach is collected or otherwise reasonably becomes available to Oracle and to the extent permitted by law, Oracle will provide You with additional relevant information concerning the breach reasonably known or available to Oracle.
6. Subprocessors
To the extent Oracle engages Oracle affiliates and third-party subprocessors to have access to Services Personal Information for the purpose of assisting in the provision of Services, such subprocessors shall be subject to the same level of data protection and security as Oracle under the terms of Your order for Services. Oracle is responsible for its subprocessors’ compliance with the terms of Your order for Services.
Oracle maintains lists of Oracle Affiliates and subprocessors that may process Services Personal Information. Additional information is available to You via My Oracle Support (
https://support.oracle.com
) Document ID 2121811.1, or other applicable primary support tool provided for the Services.
7. Cross-border data transfers
Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and Services Personal Information may be processed globally as necessary in accordance with this policy. If Services Personal Information is transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, Oracle will take adequate measures designed to protect the Services Personal Information, such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to the terms of the EU Model Clauses or other adequate transfer mechanism as required under relevant data protection.
In the event the services agreement between You and Oracle references the
Oracle Data Processing Agreement for Oracle Services
(“DPA”), further details on the relevant data transfer mechanism that applies to Your order for Oracle services are available in the DPA. In particular, for Services Personal Information transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, such transfers are subject to Oracle’s Binding Corporate Rules for Processors (BCR-P) or the terms of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. For Services Personal Information transferred from the United Kingdom (UK), such transfers are subject to the UK Addendum or other appropriate transfer mechanism.
Oracle also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (collectively, the “DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, regarding the collection, use, and retention of Services Personal Information when You and Oracle have agreed by contract that transfers of such information from the EEA, United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), or Switzerland will be transferred and processed pursuant to the applicable DPF for the relevant Services. Oracle will then be responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as a subprocessor on our behalf do the same. Oracle shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its subprocessor processes Services Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Oracle proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Oracle has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPF Principles with regard to Services Personal Information (as described above) that is transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and/or Switzerland to the United States when specified in a relevant contract. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Services Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF program, and to view Oracle’s certification, please visit
Data Privacy Framework website
.
Please see the
Data Privacy Framework website
or refer to this list of U.S. entities covered under Oracle’s DPF self-certification. With respect to Services Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the DPF, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Oracle’s compliance with the DPF.
8. Audit rights
To the extent provided in your order for Services, You may at Your sole expense audit Oracle’s compliance with the terms of this Services Privacy Policy by sending Oracle a written request, including a detailed audit plan, at least six weeks in advance of the proposed audit date. You and Oracle will work cooperatively to agree on a final audit plan.
The audit shall be conducted no more than once during a twelve-month period, during regular business hours, subject to Oracle’s on-site policies and regulations, and may not unreasonably interfere with business activities. If You would like to use a third party to conduct the audit, the third party auditor shall be mutually agreed to by the parties and the third-party auditor must execute a written confidentiality agreement acceptable to Oracle. Upon completion of the audit, You will provide Oracle with a copy of the audit report, which is classified as confidential information under the terms of Your agreement with Oracle.
Oracle will contribute to such audits by providing You with the information and assistance reasonably necessary to conduct the audit, including any relevant records of processing activities applicable to the Services. If the requested audit scope is addressed in a SOC 1 or SOC 2, ISO, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA or similar audit report issued by a qualified third party auditor within the prior twelve months and Oracle provides such report to You confirming there are no known material changes in the controls audited, You agree to accept the findings presented in the third party audit report in lieu of requesting an audit of the same controls covered by the report. Additional audit terms may be included in Your order for Services.
9. Deletion or return of Services Personal Information
Except as otherwise specified in an order for services or required by law, upon termination of services, Oracle will return or delete any remaining copies of Your production customer data, including any Services Personal Information, located on Oracle systems or Services environments. Additional information on data deletion functionality is provided in the applicable Services descriptions.

The algorithms analyze that data and compare it to our historical data on successful and unsuccessful candidates. Automated results are always evaluated by Oracle recruiters and are never the sole source of considering a candidate for employment.
4. WHICH CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE PROCESS AND FROM WHICH SOURCES?
We process personal information that you provide directly to us, such as when you register in the Oracle Recruiting Cloud, submit a job application on the Sites, sign up to receive emails, participate in surveys,  in connection with a recruiting event, or when we conduct a remote or in-person interview. We may also receive personal information about you from other sources, such as from references, in connection with background or employment checks, target companies where Oracle conducts due diligence related to a potential acquisition of your employer, and from third party sources like professional headhunters or recruiting firms, data brokers or if allowed by applicable law other sources such as Sites. Sites include, without limitation, social sites or platforms you have joined, where you have created a public page or profile or otherwise given permission so that recruiters can access and use your information. They also can include vendor sites where Oracle has invited you to participate in assessments, evaluations or online interviews. Online video interviews are subject to supplemental
privacy terms
.

employment background
job qualifications and work eligibility, including your nationality, country of residence, and visa and immigration status

These purposes are described below in further detail.
To communicate with you and respond to your requests or application or to inform you about opportunities and events
If you get in touch with us (for example, through Oracle Recruiting Cloud, contact forms, sign up to receive email, contact with our recruiters, at events or via Sites) we process information about you to communicate with you about your application or job interests.

If you are selected for a position at Oracle, information about you will also be used to facilitate the hiring process. Please be aware that, prior to hiring you and in order for Oracle to be able to extend an offer to you, you may be requested to complete a background check in accordance with Oracle policies and local law. For more information about this background check and the processing of information about you in connection with a background check, please see
Oracle’s Background Check Process

To enable your use of the Oracle Recruiting Cloud
When you choose to register with us to set up an Oracle Recruiting Cloud account, we need to process your personal information so that we can create and administer your personal account. Upon creating your account, we will send you your personal login information. This personal information enables us to administer your account (such as authenticating your access or changing your password at your request).
To analyze, develop and improve the Oracle Recruiting Cloud, our recruiting activities and Oracle products and services
In order to analyze, develop and improve Oracle Recruiting Cloud, our recruiting activities and Oracle products and services, Oracle may process information about you, for example if you encountered any problems in using Oracle Recruiting Cloud or if it is not functioning as expected. We may also process information about you to develop and test new products or system versions, patches and updates. We may also conduct surveys to collect data and see what you think about Oracle and our recruiting activities.
To maintain the security of the Oracle Recruiting Cloud
We may use personal information about you as necessary to maintain the security of the Oracle Recruiting Cloud, and our sites, systems and networks. For example, we may process information about you when investigating suspicious activity on our sites, systems and networks.

In some cases, we may process information about you to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as legally mandated reporting or other legal process requests.

17. NATIONAL HEALTH DATA SYSTEM (SNDS) NOTICE IN FRANCE
Information notice on personal data protection in the context of studies requiring access to data from the National Health Data System (SNDS).
The context
The National Health Data System (SNDS) was created by the law on the modernization of the health system (Law No. 2016-41 of January 26, 2016, available on the Legifrance website) and it was established by the National Health Insurance Fund (Cnam).
The SNDS collects a set of medico-administrative data fed by different databases and covering almost the entire French population under the responsibility of the Health Insurance. The Law on the organization and transformation of the healthcare system of 2019 (Law No. 2019-774 of 24 July 2019, available on the Legifrance website) has further extended its scope to include categories of complementary data.
The main components of the SNDS can be requested to the Cnam on its portal to carry out health research studies under certain conditions.
Access to data from the National Health Data System (SNDS) may be granted if a collective information note is posted on both of the websites of the entities representing and in charge of the research: the health institution (sponsor of the study) identified as the controller, and Oracle identified as the responsible for the implementation of the data processing of the SNDS.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14.5(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this collective information note describes the measures implemented in the context of health research, studies and evaluations requiring access to data from the National Health Data System (SNDS) that does not allow or require individual information.
This notice informs you about how we collect, use, disclose and store information about SNDS data.
As the implementation manager, we process the data on behalf of our clients, Sponsors of the studies. The processing is based on the legitimate interest of our clients, in order to progress scientific research for the development and evaluation of health care.
In addition to this collective information note and to meet the legal obligations of information and transparency on the use of data of the SNDS, the various studies are also referenced in a public directory maintained by the Health Data Hub (HDH)
publicly available on its website
.
Data sources
This note applies to all health research, studies and assessments using data from the SNDS, including:
Reimbursement data for compulsory health insurance schemes (SNIIRAM (National System of Information Inter Regimes of Health Insurance));
Hospital data (PMSI database [Information Systems Medicalization Program])
Medical causes of death databases (BCMD database)
Disability data (from the departmental houses of persons with disabilities - MDPH - data from the National Solidarity Fund for Autonomy - CNSA);
Covid-19 data from the Covid Vaccine and SI-DEP (information and screening system) databases.
The data processed in the SDNS are data relating to hospitalizations (disease responsible for hospitalization and associated comorbidities) and/or data relating to reimbursed care provided outside of hospital settings (medical consultation, delivery of treatments, medical acts, ...)
How and why SNDS data is used
We use and analyze the data of the SNDS according to a protocol specific to each study that has been approved by CESREES (Ethical and Scientific Committee for Health Research, Studies and Assessments). CESREES is responsible for the approval of studies requiring the use of personal health data, before getting the authorization of the CNIL.
The objectives of scientific research include epidemiological, pharmaco-epidemiological and health economics studies. No analysis shall be performed with the purpose of promoting products to health professionals or institutions or for insurance purposes. The processing of the data concerned is in the public interest and is the subject of scientific communications such as conferences and peer-reviewed journals.
We are committed to implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that only unidentified data is used, data minimisation practices are followed and ethical standards are maintained.
Data Privacy
In accordance with the requirements of the Public Health Code, the personal data contained in these databases do not allow the identification of the individuals to which they relate. These data are called "pseudonymised" to preserve the privacy of persons: no surname, first name, address or social security number appears.
The presentation of the results of these studies may in no way permit the direct or indirect identification of the persons concerned. And no reconciliation (data intersection) of the results is possible with other personal data.
People with access to data
The conditions for making the SNDS available are strictly regulated by law. The studies are carried out only through design offices, such as Oracle, which has made a compliance commitment to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL).
For example, only authorized Oracle personnel can access SNDS data for scientific research purposes, subject to professional secrecy in accordance with Articles 226-13 and 223-14 of the Criminal Code. Data is made available through a secure platform from Cnam, without exporting any personal data. No third party, including our clients, has access, directly or indirectly, to the data of the SNDS. Only aggregated and anonymous results may be communicated and in no case allow the direct or indirect identification of the persons concerned.
Data retention
The retention period of the data processed in the context of these studies shall be the period necessary for carrying out the study and is justified by the controller. Data may be retained at the end of the study for a maximum period of two years from the last publication on the results.
Exercising your rights
In accordance with the provisions of Article R. 1461-9 of the Public Health Code, you have several rights in relation to your personal data. You can access and request rectification of your data, as well as object to their processing for research, study or evaluation purposes. You can exercise your rights by contacting the director of the managing body of the compulsory health insurance plan to which you belong. Oracle does not have your identity as part of this research and will not be able to identify you to enable you to exercise your rights.
You also have the right to file a claim with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), online or by mail at 3 Place de Fontenoy - TSA 80715 - 75334 PARIS CEDEX 07.
Oracle has also designated a Data Protection Officer who you may contact at:

4. WHICH CATEGORIES AND SPECIFIC PIECES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE PROCESS?
Depending on how you use the Restaurant Services and whether you are a Restaurant Client, Partner, or Restaurant Holder when interacting with the Platform or FoodBooking, the personal information Oracle processes may include:
Contact information:
name, email address, phone number, address;
Order information:
transactional details based on your orders, financial details, and payment methods, delivery address(es), and your favorite Restaurants in your geographic location;

Please note that we can provide certain Restaurant Services only if you provide your personal information. If you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to use the Restaurant Services. For example, if you do not provide your name and contact details, you will not be able to order food via the FoodBooking app.
5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We may use your personal information for the following business purposes:
to centrally store and manage Restaurant Clients’ personal information in connection with the Restaurant Services;
to provide the functionality of the FoodBooking mobile app to Restaurant Clients;
to generate aggregated analytics for marketing messages sent and websites created by Restaurants via the Platform;
to provide, deliver, and manage the requested functionality of the Restaurant Services and the Restaurant Order-Taking App;
to communicate and respond to requests and inquiries to Oracle, including to provide support via the support chat functionality or email;
to administer the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program;
to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of the Restaurant Services;
to manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems; and
to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
To centrally store and manage Restaurant Clients’ personal information in connection with the Restaurant Services.
When Restaurant Clients order food via the FoodBooking app or the Restaurant’s website or app, their personal information is stored and managed centrally on the Oracle Restaurants eStore Online Ordering system. The information provided by a Restaurant Client when submitting an order is collected specifically for a Restaurant and held by Oracle in order to provide the Restaurant Services.
To provide the functionality of the FoodBooking mobile app to Restaurant Clients.
When Restaurant Clients download and use the FoodBooking mobile app, Restaurant Clients can locate Restaurants that use the Platform, view the menus of these Restaurants, and place orders with them.
To generate aggregated analytics for marketing messages sent and websites created by Restaurants via the Platform.
Restaurant Holders can use the Platform to generate aggregated analytics about the marketing messages they sent, and the websites they created, via the Platform. Oracle uses personal information to generate aggregated analytics on behalf of, and at the direction of, a Restaurant or Restaurant Holder. For example, aggregated information may include the percentage of recipients that open a marketing message without identifying the specific Restaurant Client or the number of new or repeat Restaurant Clients who visit the Restaurant website.
To provide, deliver, and manage the requested functionality of the Restaurant Services and the Restaurant Order-Taking App.
When Restaurant Holders and Partners choose to register with us, we process personal information provided by them so that we can create an Oracle Restaurants eStore Online Ordering account for them. In addition, Restaurant Holders can download and use the Restaurant Order-Taking App to receive orders that are placed with their Restaurant via the Platform. Oracle processes contact and device information to provide this functionality.
To communicate and respond to requests and inquiries to Oracle, including to provide support via the support chat functionality or email.
Oracle may process personal information when individuals have questions about the Restaurant Services or other support questions and reach out to us via the support chat functionality or via email. The support chat functionality is intended only for Restaurant Holders and Partners; Restaurant Clients that have questions about their orders should contact the relevant Restaurant directly.
To administer the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program.
We process Partners’ and Restaurant Holders’ personal information when a Partner enrolls a Restaurant Holder with us, and when we sign up this Restaurant Holder to the Platform.
To analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of the Restaurant Services.
We may process aggregated personal information in order to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, including for quality assurance and training purposes.
To manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems.
We collect and use personal information for our own security and operations management to help keep the Restaurant Services, and related data and systems of Restaurant Clients, Restaurant Holders, Partners, and Oracle under our control, secure. We may also collect usage and systems operations data from Oracle websites or mobile apps to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks, malicious activity, or potential fraud, and to detect bots.
To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
In some cases, we may collect and use personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend against legal claims. We may also process personal information in the operation of our business. For example, to conduct audits and investigations, for finance and accounting, archiving and insurance purposes.
6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?
For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, the UK and other relevant jurisdictions, our legal basis for processing is the following:
The legal basis for processing individuals’ personal information to administer and manage personal information to provide the requested Restaurant Services or related support services is contractual necessity.
The legal basis for processing Restaurant Clients’ personal information to compile aggregated statistics on marketing campaign or website performance is Oracle’s legitimate interest to better understand and improve the services it provides to its customers. The Restaurant is responsible for collecting any required consent from Restaurant Clients prior to sending marketing messages per the Oracle Restaurants eStore Master Agreement.
The legal basis for administrating the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program is our legitimate interest in acquiring new Restaurant Holders for the Platform via the Partner Program and the necessity of this processing to take (pre)contractual measures to sign up the new Restaurant Holders.
The legal basis for analyzing, developing, improving, and optimizing our sites, facilities, products, and services, and to maintain the security of our sites, networks and systems is our legitimate interest to provide functional and secure services.
In some cases, processing may be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Oracle is subject, such as to process an opt-out request.
7. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Oracle maintains personal information for the following retention periods:
We retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
For as long as necessary for Oracle to provide the Restaurant Services;
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
8. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Sharing within Oracle
As a global organization, information about you may be shared globally throughout Oracle’s worldwide organization. See the list of

Third-party service providers (for example, credit card and payment processing services, order fulfilment, analytics, event/campaign management, meeting scheduling, website management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service and support, e-mail delivery, auditing, and other similar service providers) in order for those service providers to perform business functions on behalf of Oracle;
Relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings);
As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to government requests, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes.
When third parties are given access to personal information, we will take appropriate contractual, technical and organizational measures designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with applicable law.

Recursive DNS service
and
Updater Client
(“Internet Performance Tools”). For more information on Oracle’s personal information collection and use practices in connection with these tools, see section 4, “WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?”
This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected by customers of Oracle when they use the Internet Performance Tools on their websites and collect information about you for their own purposes. To find out more about how our customers may collect and use information about you on their websites, please review the privacy policy of the company who collected your information, and consult them if you have any further questions.
This Privacy Policy also does not apply to personal information Oracle collects in connection with your interactions with the
www.oracle.com
website, which is subject to the terms of the terms of
Oracle’s Privacy Policy
.
This Privacy Policy was last updated on December 16, 2022. However, the Privacy Policy can change over time, for example to meet changing business or legal requirements. The most up-to-date version can be found on this
website
. In case there is an important change that we want to highlight to you, we will also inform you in another appropriate way (for example, via a pop-up notice or statement of changes on our website).

2. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Oracle America, Inc., having its registered address at 2300 Oracle Way, Austin, TX, 78741, USA, is responsible for processing your personal information in scope of this Privacy Policy.
For personal information sourced in the EU/EEA, Oracle America, Inc.’s EU representative is Oracle EMEA Limited, having its registered address at East Point Business Park, Fairview, Dublin 3, Ireland.
For personal information sourced in the UK, Oracle America, Inc.’s UK representative is Oracle Corporation UK Ltd, having its registered address at Oracle Parkway, Thames Valley Park (TVP), Reading, Berkshire, RG6 1RA, UK.
3. WHICH CATEGORIES AND SPECIFIC PIECES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE PROCESS AND FROM WHICH SOURCES?
Oracle’s Internet Performance Tools are designed to improve the way you experience the Internet by monitoring the performance of your internet connected devices and services you use to access the Internet. Any time you use or interact with the Internet Performance Tools as described below in Section 4, information is automatically generated and collected by Oracle. Personal information is information collected online by the Internet Performance Tools and may indirectly identify you, which includes:
IP address and port
Country, State, and City
IP address of recursive DNS provider
Time and date of query
Domain queried
Query details (e.g., TTL, query type, DNS flags, DNSSEC info)
Query response
Information related to your device’s performance when accessing and utilizing the internet, including time to resolve DNS, time spent making request, time spent downloading the response, and the total time between the response and the site loading (collectively referred to as “Internet Performance”).
Oracle does not collect direct identifiers (such as first and last name, address, or email address) through the use of the Internet Performance Tools and will not associate—and does not allow our third party partners to associate—the indirect identifiers listed above with direct identifiers.
4. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Oracle uses the information collected by the Internet Performance Tools for the following purposes, which are described in further detail below:
a) to enable the Recursive DNS service for users who choose to use that service;
b) to enable the Dyn Updater Client to update IP address for Remote Access services;
c) to collect data on site performance via RUM beacons;
d) to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of Oracle products and services;
e) to manage and assess the security of our sites, networks and systems and to allow our third party partners to manage and assess the security of sites, networks, and systems; and
f) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
a) to enable the Recursive DNS service for users who choose to use the service
We collect information to enable the Recursive DNS service for users who want an alternative to existing DNS recursive resolvers. For example, if you have noticed that your internet performance has been lagging on your internet connected device, you may enable the Dyn Recursive DNS service on your device by pointing to Dyn recursive resolvers to try to improve internet performance.
b) to enable the Dyn Updater Client to update IP address for Remote Access services;
Oracle’s Remote Access service allows you to choose a unique hostname (e.g., MyHome.dyndns.org) and link it to any IP-compatible device (such as a router, webcam, security camera, DVR, thermostat, computer, or file storage) to create your own unique Remote Access subdomain. The Dyn Updater Client works in conjunction with Remote Access services to keep your dynamic IP address up to date. The Updater Client allows Oracle to recognize that your dynamic IP address has changed and automatically update your IP address for your Remote Access subdomain to enable continued, uninterrupted remote access to your device.
c) to collect data on Internet Performance via RUM beacons;
Oracle’s RUM Beacons are a technology that executes a series of small file requests when users connect and interact with the Internet. This technology may be deployed in one of a number of ways. Oracle might deploy the RUM Beacon as a “web beacon” (or “single-pixel” or “clear” GIFs) embedded in our website that is invisible to users. For example, when you visit an Oracle site that deploys RUM Beacons, your browser will send requests for test files to different locations on the Internet to determine Internet Performance to various datacenters across the globe, allowing Oracle to determine the best data center to serve content from for your Internet Service Provider.
Oracle deploys its RUM Beacons as part of your use of Oracle’s Updater Client, as described above. When you download the Updater Client, it will send requests for test files to different locations on the internet to provide Oracle with Internet Performance information.
d) to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of Oracle products and services
We process the information collected from the Internet Performance Tools for internal research for technological development and demonstration and to improve, upgrade, or enhance Oracle products and services. We also use the information for statistical analyses related to the performance and operation of the Internet Performance Tools.
e) to assess and manage the security of Oracle sites, networks and systems and to allow our third party partners to assess and manage the security of sites, networks, and systems
We process personal information for managing security and operations to help keep our networks and systems as well as our products and services secure, or to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks or potential fraud. We may share the data with our third party partners to allow our partners to assess and manage the security of sites, networks, and systems, or to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks or potential fraud. Please see section 7 for our sharing practices with our partners.
f) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business
In some cases, we may process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process personal information in the operation of our business. For example, to conduct audits and investigations, for finance and accounting, archiving and insurance purposes.
5. FOR EUROPEAN UNION (EU) RESIDENTS, WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?
For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, our basis for processing is the following:
Information about you collected to enable your use of the Internet Performance Tools are
necessary for the performance of the applicable
terms of service or license agreement
.
Oracle will process information about you as may be necessary for internal research for technological development and demonstration and to improve, upgrade, or enhance Oracle products and services based on our
legitimate interests
when such processing has a limited privacy impact on the individual.
Oracle will process information about you as may be necessary to detect, prevent, or predict malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity on Oracle sites, networks, and systems based on our
legitimate interests
in order for Oracle to safeguard such systems.
Oracle may also process personal information as necessary for
compliance with our legal obligations
.
6. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Oracle maintains personal information collected by the Internet Performance Tools for up to 12 months as of the moment it was first collected by the Internet Performance Tools. We may retain de-identified data (such as a hashed IP address incapable of being re-identified) for longer than 12 months.
7. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Sharing within Oracle
As a global organization, information about you can be shared globally throughout Oracle’s worldwide organization  for a business purpose. A list of Oracle entities is available
here
. Please select a region and country to view the registered address and contact details of the Oracle entity or entities located in each country. Oracle employees are authorized to access personal information only to the extent necessary to serve the applicable purpose(s) and to perform their job functions.
Sharing with third parties
We may share personal information with the following third parties for a commercial purpose:
Oracle partners such as internet security companies or retailers, for analytics on site security and site or internet performance. IP addresses are truncated by removing the last octet prior to sharing with internet security companies or retailers for the purposes described in Section 4(f) above.
We may share personal information with the following third parties for a business purpose:
third-party service providers as necessary to perform services on behalf of Oracle;
relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings; and
as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to government requests, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes.
When third parties are given access to personal information, we will take appropriate contractual, technical and organizational measures designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable law.
8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
You can refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser, DNS updater, or email software. Disabling javascript will disable RUM Beacons integrated into websites and will impact your ability to use the Internet Performance Tools. Please refer to your browser software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.
Oracle does not collect direct identifiers (such as first and last name, address, or email address) through the use of the Internet Performance Tools and will not associate—and does not allow our third party partners to associate—the indirect identifiers collected by the Internet Performance Tools with direct identifiers. Thus, requests to access, amend, correct, or delete data collected via the Internet Performance Tools would create a burden or expense disproportionate to the risks to your privacy.
9. WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT?
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended, California residents may request that we:
1. disclose to you the following information:
the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collected about you and the categories of personal information we sold (see
Section 3
);
the categories of sources from which we collected such personal information (see
Section 3
);
the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information about you (see
Section 4
); and
the categories of third parties to whom we sold or otherwise disclosed personal information (see
Section 7
).
2. delete personal information we collected from you or correct inaccurate personal information about you (see
Section 8
); or
3. opt-out of any future sale of personal information about you (see
Section 8
).
Oracle will not discriminate against you if you exercise these rights under the CCPA.
We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.
If you are a California resident, you may obtain information about exercising your rights, as described above, by contacting us at 1-800-633-0748.
10. DOES ORACLE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN?
Oracle does not knowingly collect any personal information from, and does not tailor any services to, children under the age of 16.
11. HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION HANDLED GLOBALLY?
Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and personal information is processed globally as necessary in accordance with this policy. If personal information is transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information under applicable data protection law in the country where such information was collected, Oracle will take adequate measures designed to protect the personal information, such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to EU Model Clauses, Oracle’s BCR-P, or other adequate transfer mechanism as required under relevant data protection laws.
12. HOW IS INFORMATION ABOUT YOU SECURED?
Oracle has implemented appropriate technical, physical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, damage, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, as well as all other forms of unlawful processing.
13. HOW TO CONTACT ORACLE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, COMMENTS OR COMPLAINTS?
