I needed a survey done for my HOA requirements. I called and the survey was done within 2 days and I received a copy after another couple of days. It was just what I needed at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this company.

We work with NexGen often, and they are a wonderful surveying company. They are always willing to go the extra mile and are extremely professional. Their Account Representative, Mike is a huge asset. We love working with them.

Very impressive service! We needed a survey done for new fence installation and NexGen came highly recommended from our realtor. Two phone calls is all it took. First to get quote rolling, second was to make payment for services. Less than 2 days later, survey emailed to me. Quick and easy - hassle free. Would use again without question!
- Douglas Bakke
This company has been great to work with.  They let you know when they are scheduled, show up on time and get the job done.  The price was also reasonable.  I had the pleasure of working with John Pellecchia who was extremely professional and helpful,

We get all our surveys through NexGen and they are outstanding!  They are always quick to respond, their pricing is solid and their turnaround times are great!  We are very appreciative and look forward to working with them for many years to come.

In today's busy environment, it is difficult to find a surveyor that will respond timely.  With NexGen, we were extremely happy when they completed the job and grateful for the attention to detail that their work displayed.  We highly recommend working with them.
- Jerry Hoffman
Very reasonably priced, and turned around the survey in three business days after telling me it would take a week!   The quality of the work seemed professional, and my lender and the title insurance company accepted the boundary survey of my house immediately.
