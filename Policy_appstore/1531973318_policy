I bought this bonnet for my 6 year old daughter because she was waking up with so many tangles in her beautiful long, curly hair. We were having to use so much detangler spray and still brushing her hair in the morning was uncomfortable and time consuming. I knew the bonnet would be too big, but I took a chance because I figured I could just keep it for myself if it didn't work out. It was big, but we put it on anyway and it stayed on for most of the night since she is not a restless sleeper. Her hair was beautiful, frizz-free and shiny this morning and no spray was needed because no more tangles!!! I plan on purchasing another for myself to match! So happy with this product! If a small or kids size would become available that would be great! Otherwise, if you have a sound sleeping kiddo, it will be loose, but still might work!
