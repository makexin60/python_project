Like millions of other apps, MoodTools uses Google Analytics. Google Analytics grabs
anonymous
usage data from users. You are free to opt out of tracking by going to the Settings page within the app.
What does Google Analytics record?
Which pages in the app you visit
Events in the app such as the clicking of buttons, test scores, activity selections, video selections, which information sections are visited, distress levels, etc.
What country you come from
How long you stay in the app
What kind of phone you’re using (device model + operating system)
Estimated demographic data from Google such as age range, gender, and interest categories
What is not recorded?
No personal information is recorded in the application that could be possibly used to identify you in case of a data breach. All of your private information is stored offline on your phone or tablet. This includes:
Text typed in Thought Diary entries
Every part of the Safety Plan
Any data from outside this app other than what is automatically recorded by Google Analytics
What do you do with this data?
The information gathered through Google Analytics will allow us to better understand the usage patterns of the app and improve the app with updates in the future. For example, which functions of the app are people using the most? Which functions do people barely use? When the app crashes, where does it crash? Anonymous aggregated data may also be used for research and publication purposes to answer research questions. For example, which functions of the app are people using the most?

Effective date: February 20, 2020
TL;DR:
No personal information is gathered from the application unless you are using the Cloud Sync feature within Pro Mode. We use Firebase Analytics and Apple App Store Data to collect anonymous aggregate data. Firebase Analytics gathers information such as country, amount of time spent on a page across all users, and how often users return to the application. Apple reports information such as OS version, country, carrier, and date downloaded.
If you are using the Cloud Sync feature within Pro Mode, you will be required to sign in with a Google Account. Your entries will be securely uploaded to Google Cloud Storage via Firebase Storage. Remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you are from the European Union, please view the section below called “European Union Information” for information on how we comply with privacy laws in the EU.
