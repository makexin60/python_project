A Note on COPPA
At Kodable, we take children's privacy very seriously. While our game is designed for children, our website (www.kodable.com) and teacher dashboard (dashboard.kodable.com) is just for adults (parents and teachers) over the age of 18. Our game does not collect
any
personally identifiable information from children.
Please contact us at support@kodable.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper parental consents so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.
To find more information on COPPA, you can visit
