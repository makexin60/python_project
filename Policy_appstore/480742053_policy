How does Stride use Personal Information?
Stride uses Personal Information to provide our Services, including educational services to children enrolled in a Local School, tutoring services, other education related online community platforms managed by Stride, communication services with teachers and/or other users, Local Schools, to contact you and provide customer service and to otherwise support you and your child for things such as testing, curriculum, academic progress, attendance, customer service, communication, student affairs, accommodations or special education, or for health or safety purposes.
For certain Sites, once you have registered your child in a Local School for a Stride School Program or for tutoring or other services, there may be a page that contains some or all the Personal Information. You may also be assigned a Member ID and password and may create, at your discretion, a Member ID for your child any time you are logged on to the OLS. If you choose someone other than yourself as a learning coach, that person will also be assigned a Member ID. The Member IDs will be used to identify you, the learning coach, and your child on the OLS. The Member IDs will be associated with the following information: your first and last name; registration ID; type of account, such as teacher, administrator, parent, learning coach, or student (if you created a separate Member ID and password for your child or learning coach); your child’s Local School; integration number; the e-mail address and education records of your child connected with the account. The Member IDs and the OLS will allow you and the learning coach to track your child’s attendance, school work, and testing, and to submit that to Stride or your Local School to follow your child’s progress and comply with law.
In addition, parts of our Services and products, such as our chatbots, may be supported by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies designed to personalize user interactions based on individual preferences. For instance, if a user indicates an interest in a particular topic, the AI will tailor its responses and suggestions accordingly. In addition, you may be able to create content, such as storybooks, on certain Sites, which rely on AI tools. This personalized information may be shared across our product lines, affiliates, and with service providers essential to the functionality of these products. We may use and retain information and content collected or generated in connection with AI technologies to operate, provide, and improve the Services.
Depending on your relationship with us, we may use your Personal Information for one or more of the following purposes: administering applications and enrollment, providing educational services, personalizing content and experiences, analyzing and improving our services, content, functionality and the usability of our Sites, completing applicant and employee background checks, administering employment benefits and providing employee services, securing and protecting our assets and rights and preventing misconduct and violations to our Terms of Use, complying with legal obligations, inviting you to participate in surveys and provide feedback to us, having a better understanding of your needs and interests, contacting you with information that may be of interest to you, improving marketing and promotional efforts, and supporting our general business.
Stride or your Local School may use the Personal Information you provide to contact you or your child’s learning coach about your child’s progress, testing, attendance, or other school issues or for customer service and quality control. The Personal Information is also used to provide services to you, your child or your child’s Local School, or to carry out activities that you or your child’s Local School have requested. Stride also uses Personal Information you supply to satisfy requests for information, and to deliver requested services to you and your child.
We use Website Usage Data to monitor and improve our Sites and better understand your engagement with the Services. We also use it to study Internet traffic trends and use third party content moderation tools to monitor written content, messages, and communications on our Sites, and to customize and personalize content, administer the Sites, and gather information.
Where permitted by law, Stride may use your information to provide you with information about new products or services available through Stride and may analyze Personal Information to improve the educational experience, improve Stride’s services, or to determine how Stride’s educational products and services may interest other people.
We retain your Personal Information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. When determining the length of time to retain your information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to continue to provide you the Services, resolve a dispute, enforce our contractual agreements, prevent harm, promote safety, security, and integrity, or protect ourselves, including our rights, property, or products. We also retain backups of certain data for archival and record-keeping purposes and as required by applicable law.

How does Stride treat Personal Information about children under 13 years old?
Stride receives Personal Information about children who are under the age of 13 in certain circumstances. When our Services are used by a Local School in an educational setting, we rely on the Local School to create an account for the child and obtain consent on behalf of the Parent. Stride may receive Personal information directly from your child, such as information your child provides on the OLS as part of your child’s education in a Stride-powered School Program or through your child’s interactions with other services on our Sites.
For a child under the age of 13 years old, we require consent from the child’s parent or legal guardian to register for or access services outside the Local School educational setting, including participation in the national K12 Zone.
If you become aware that we unknowingly received information about a child under the age of 13 without consent, please email us at
privacy@K12.com
. Also, if you are the parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has provided us with their Personal Information, you can email us to review that Personal Information or request that it be deleted.
For information on our compliance with COPPA and our use of Personal Information of children under the age of 13, please contact us at:

How does Stride use Personal Information?
” With respect to SMS text messaging consent (see section 20 of our Terms of Use), we will not share mobile information collected as part of such consent with third parties for marketing purposes.
We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA and used throughout this section) Personal Information of residents under 16 years of age. However, we sell, and have sold in the preceding 12 months, identifiers (such as email addresses) to affiliates and third parties for marketing purposes.

Users under 18
Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Services and who have posted content or information on the Services can request that such information be removed from the Services by contacting us at the e-mail, phone number or address set forth in the section at the bottom of this policy. Such request must state that they personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable, good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the resident cannot be individually identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished the post, and archived copies of it may be stored by search engines and other parties that we do not control.
Shine the Light
In addition, California law permits residents to request certain details about how their “personal information” (as defined in California Civil Code Section 1798.83) is shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may from time to time elect to share certain personal information about you with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Residents may, under certain circumstances, obtain the categories of personal information shared and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year. To make such a request, please contact us using the information listed below. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per resident each year.
What are my additional privacy rights if I’m a resident of certain states?

However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law, including in the event you reside in a state that does not currently grant you these rights.
We have the right to limit your rights to the extent they adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others and, if your request is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded, to require payment from you. If a fee applies, we will advise the person making the request before completing the request, explain why a fee applies, and provide an estimate.
Only you, your parent or legal guardian (if you are under 18 years of age), or a person registered with the applicable Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a request related to your Personal Information.

We will also require that you verify your identity directly with us. To verify your identity as a resident of one of the states mentioned above, we may request Personal Information from you to compare against our records. We will only use Personal Information provided in your request to verify your identity. If we believe that your request is fraudulent, we may take additional steps, as necessary, to verify your identity and your residence in the applicable state.

We may have tools or services that help users interact with others on our Sites such as message boards or chat rooms, video chatting, image or screen sharing, electronic mail, or social platforms.

We reserve the right, but not the duty, to monitor your communications with others (including private messages with other users) and to publish your posts or interactions in other places on the Internet or in other formats. Stride may, in its sole discretion, use third-party service providers to assist with content moderation, and/or student or user safety. We may use certain information, which may include content reported to us, to create or use systems or models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, or act against illegal or harmful content.

GPC
Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.
Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
