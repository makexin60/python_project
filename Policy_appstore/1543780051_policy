Accordingly, you and GENTLEBIRTH agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms (a "Claim") in accordance with one of the subsections below or as GENTLEBIRTH and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation. (a) Choice of Law; Forum. These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against GENTLEBIRTH must be resolved by a court located in Santa Clara CA, except as otherwise agreed by you and GENTLEBIRTH or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located within California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes, and hereby waive any claims or defenses that such courts are an inconvenient forum. (b) Arbitration Option. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $5,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any ADR provider chosen under this Section 20.2(b) must be located in an office based in, or be a permanent resident of, Santa Clara County, California. (c) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against GENTLEBIRTH must be resolved in accordance with this Section 20.2 (Dispute Resolution). All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 20.2 (Dispute Resolution) shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 20.2 (Dispute Resolution), GENTLEBIRTH may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that GENTLEBIRTH has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
20.3 Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of GENTLEBIRTH to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
20.4 Severability. In the event that the application of any provision of these Terms to any particular facts or circumstances shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable under the law hereof, then: (a) such provision shall be reformed without further action by the Parties to the extent strictly necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable when applied to such particular facts or circumstances; and (b) the validity and enforceability of such provision as applied to any other particular facts or circumstances, and the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions of these Terms, shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.

(b) Arbitration Option. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $5,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any ADR provider chosen under this Section 20.2(b) must be located in an office based in, or be a permanent resident of, Santa Clara County, California. (c) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against GENTLEBIRTH must be resolved in accordance with this Section 20.2 (Dispute Resolution).

Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 20.2 (Dispute Resolution), GENTLEBIRTH may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that GENTLEBIRTH has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
20.3 Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of GENTLEBIRTH to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
20.4 Severability. In the event that the application of any provision of these Terms to any particular facts or circumstances shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable under the law hereof, then: (a) such provision shall be reformed without further action by the Parties to the extent strictly necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable when applied to such particular facts or circumstances; and (b) the validity and enforceability of such provision as applied to any other particular facts or circumstances, and the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions of these Terms, shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.
