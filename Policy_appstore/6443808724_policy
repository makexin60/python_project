6. Cookies
Browsing on the Website results in the deposit of cookies, with your consent where required.
Cookies are stored on your device when you have browsed the DFS’s Websites. Cookies are small text files which are likely to be stored in a dedicated space on the hard drive of your device (computer, tablet, smart phone, etc.) when you consult an on-line service using your browser.
The deposit of certain cookies on your device requires that you give your prior consent. Thus, as soon as you arrive on our Website, an information banner indicates that we are using this technology and that by clicking on "Accept cookies", you agree to the deposit of these cookies on your device.
The cookies used on our Website are categorised, as follows:
“Strictly necessary” cookies
: DFS uses Cookies that are “strictly necessary” for the functionality of the Website’s platforms. These cookies are essential to enable users to visit the Website and fulfil express requests from the user (e.g., cookies that allow you to hold items in your cart while you shop online or cookies that temporarily store the contents of an online form).
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest. A deactivation of this type of Cookies would reduce all or part of the functions of the Website.
“Statistic” or “Performance” cookies
: Analytics Cookies gather general information on how users use a website, e.g. which pages they visit most frequently and whether they receive any error messages from websites. The data collected with these Cookies will not be merged with any other information on the visitors of the Website. All information collected through such cookies exclusively serves the purpose to comprehend and improve the functionality and services of the Website.

DFS uses the following cookies:
View Details
These cookies are kept for a maximum of thirteen (13) months. This period is not extended by your new visits.
“Advertising” cookies
: Targeting and advertising cookies are used to better customize advertisements to your interests. They limit the number of times the same advertisement is shown to you, evaluate the efficacy of an advertising campaign, and analyse how the viewing of a certain advertisement influences the behavior of individual users. Such Cookies are usually placed by advertising networks with the consent of the respective website operator. They register a user’s visit of the website and either pass such information on to other entities, e.g. advertising companies, or directly adapt advertisements accordingly so that, based on your browsing behaviour, you will be shown exactly such advertisements as may potentially interest you.
DFS uses the following cookies for advertising:
View Details
Facebook Pixel
: We utilize “Facebook Pixel” of Facebook Ireland Ltd. The Facebook pixel enables us to group the visitors to our website into specific target groups to have relevant advertisements (“ads”) displayed to you on Facebook. We do not have access to the data collected (e.g. IP addresses, information on the web browser, location of the website, buttons you clicked on, Pixel IDs and other features), we may only use it to display certain ads.
If you have a Facebook account and are logged in, your visit to this Website will be associated with your Facebook user account.
We also use Facebook’s remarketing feature “Custom Audiences”. This feature enables the display of interest-based ads (“Facebook Ads”) to users of our website that are visiting Facebook or other websites that use this function. We pursue the interest of displaying ads to you that are relevant to your interests to provide you with a more interesting experience on our website.
Your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Facebook server to exchange the relevant data. We have no control over the extent and further processing of the data collected by Facebook using this tool and therefore we provide the information available to us: the integration of Facebook Custom Audiences provides Facebook with the information that you visited the relevant web page or clicked on one of our ads. In case you are logged into a “Facebook” service, Facebook can associate your visit with your account. Even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider ascertains your IP address and other identifiers and stores them.
If you have given your consent, we might pass your telephone number or e-mail address to Facebook to be able to display ads that are relevant to your interests.
Find out more about how the Facebook pixel is used for advertisement campaigns at https://fr-fr.facebook.com/business/help/742478679120153id=1205376682832142.
