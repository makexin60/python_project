2. Hosting and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
We host our website with AWS. The provider is Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, 1855 Luxembourg (hereinafter referred to as AWS).
When you visit our website, your personal data is processed on the servers of AWS. Personal data may also be transferred to the parent company of AWS in the USA. Data transfer to the USA is based on the EU standard contractual clauses. Details can be found here:

3. General notes and mandatory information
Data protection
We know that the protection of your data is important to you. We therefore take this protection very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and would like to inform you about this transparently in this data protection declaration.
When you enter this website, various personal data is collected. This data protection declaration explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.
We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.
Note on the responsible body
The data controller for this website is:
FRITZ EGGER GmbH & Co. OG
Weiberndorf 20
6380 St. Johann in Tirol, Austria
Phone: +43 50 600
E-mail
Data protection officer required by law
The current status does not require the controller to appoint a data protection officer.
Storage period
Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this data protection declaration, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.
General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website
If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the event of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing is also carried out on the basis of Section 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfilment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f paragraphs of this data protection declaration.
Recipients of personal data
As part of our business activities, we work together with various external organisations. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external bodies if this is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in passing on data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis permits the passing on of data. When using processors, we only pass on our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
Note on the transfer of data to third countries that are not secure under data protection law and the transfer to US companies that are not DPF-certified
Among other things, we use tools from companies based in third countries that are not secure under data protection law and US tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in third countries that are unsafe under data protection law.
We would like to point out that the USA, as a safe third country, generally has a level of data protection comparable to that of the EU. Data transfer to the USA is then permitted if the recipient is certified under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) or has suitable additional guarantees. Information on transfers to third countries, including the data recipients, can be found in this data protection declaration.
Revocation of your consent to data processing
Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority
In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.
Right to data portability
You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
SSL or TLS encryption
This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or enquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
Encrypted payment transactions on this website, in particular with myEGGER
If there is an obligation to provide us with your payment data (e.g. account number for direct debit authorisation) after the conclusion of a chargeable contract, this data is required for payment processing.
Payment transactions via the common payment methods (Visa/MasterCard, direct debit) are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
Information, deletion and correction
Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the legal notice for this purpose and for further questions on the subject of personal data.
Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the legal notice. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data held by us, we will usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
If you have appealed pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
Objection to advertising e-mails
The use of contact data published within the framework of the legal notice obligation for the transmission of advertising and information material not expressly requested is herewith objected to. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example by spam e-mails.

Cookies
Our Internet pages use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small data packets and do not cause any damage to your end device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device.

Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or they are automatically deleted by your web browser.
Cookies may originate from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services from third-party companies within websites (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).
Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping basket function or the display of videos). Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behaviour or for advertising purposes.
Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions that you have requested (e.g. for the shopping basket function) or to optimise the website (e.g. cookies to measure the web audience) (necessary cookies) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of its services.
If consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and Art. 25 para. 1 TTDSG); the consent can be revoked at any time.

The data collected in this way is stored until you ask us to delete it, delete the Cookiebot cookie yourself or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Mandatory statutory storage obligations remain unaffected.
Cookiebot is used to obtain the legally required consent for the use of cookies. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.

Furthermore, targeted advertisements can be displayed on the basis of the user data available at Google (e.g. location data and interests) (target group targeting). As a website operator, we can evaluate this data quantitatively by analysing, for example, which search terms have led to the display of our advertisements and how many advertisements have led to corresponding clicks.
The use of this service is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and Art. 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.
Data transfer to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. Details can be found here:

Google AdSense
This website uses Google AdSense, a service for integrating advertisements. The provider is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
With the help of Google Adsense, we can display targeted adverts from third-party companies on our website. The content of the advertisements is based on your interests, which Google determines on the basis of your previous user behaviour. Furthermore, contextual information such as your location, the content of the website you have visited or the Google search terms you have entered are also taken into account when selecting the appropriate advert.
We use Google AdSense in "non-personalised" mode. In contrast to personalised mode, the advertisements are therefore not based on your previous user behaviour and no user profile is created of you. Instead, so-called "contextual information" is used in the selection of advertising. The selected advertisements are then based, for example, on your location, the content of the website you are on or your current search terms. For more on the differences between personalised and non-personalised targeting with Google AdSense, see:
https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9007336
.
Please note that cookies or comparable recognition technologies (e.g. device fingerprinting) may also be used when using Google Adsense in non-personalised mode. According to Google, these are used to combat fraud and abuse.
The use of this service is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and Art. 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.

Google Ads Remarketing
This website uses the functions of Google Ads Remarketing. The provider is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
With Google Ads Remarketing, we can assign people who interact with our online offering to specific target groups in order to subsequently show them interest-based advertising in the Google advertising network (remarketing or retargeting).
Furthermore, the advertising target groups created with Google Ads Remarketing can be linked to Google's cross-device functions. In this way, interest-based, personalised advertising messages that have been adapted to you on one terminal (e.g. mobile phone) depending on your previous usage and surfing behaviour can also be displayed on another of your terminals (e.g. tablet or PC).

Target group formation with customer matching
Among others, we use Google Ads Remarketing customer matching to create target groups. To achieve this, we transfer certain customer data (e.g. e-mail addresses) from our customer lists to Google. If the customers in question are Google users and logged into their Google account, they are shown suitable advertising messages within the Google network (e.g. on YouTube, Gmail or in the search engine).
Google Conversion Tracking
This website uses Google Conversion Tracking. The provider is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google Conversion Tracking allows Google and us to see whether the user has taken certain actions. For example, we can evaluate which buttons on our website were clicked how often and which products were viewed or purchased particularly frequently. This information is used to create conversion statistics. We learn the total number of users who have clicked on our ads and what actions they have taken. We do not receive any information with which we can personally identify the user. Google itself uses cookies or similar recognition technologies for identification purposes.
The use of this service is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and Art. 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.

With the help of DoubleClick, the adverts can be targeted and adapted to the interests of the respective viewer. For example, our adverts may be displayed in Google search results or in advertising banners linked to DoubleClick.
In order to be able to display interest-based advertising to users, DoubleClick must be able to recognise the respective viewer and assign the websites visited, clicks and other information on user behaviour to them.

Meta Pixel (formerly Facebook Pixel)
This website uses the visitor action pixel from Facebook/Meta to measure conversions. The provider of this service is Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland. However, according to Facebook, the data collected is also transferred to the USA and other third countries.
In this way, the behaviour of page visitors can be tracked after they have been redirected to the provider's website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This allows the effectiveness of Facebook ads to be evaluated for statistical and market research purposes and to optimise future advertising measures.
The data collected is anonymous for us as the operator of this website, we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook Data Policy (
https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/
)
This allows Facebook to place ads on Facebook pages as well as outside of Facebook. This use of data cannot be influenced by us as the site operator.
The use of this service is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and Art. 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.
Insofar as personal data is collected on our website with the help of the tool described here and forwarded to Facebook, we and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland are jointly responsible for this data processing (Art. 26 GDPR). The joint responsibility is limited exclusively to the collection of data and its transfer to Facebook. The processing carried out by Facebook after forwarding is not part of the joint responsibility. The obligations incumbent on us jointly were set out in an agreement on joint processing. The wording of the agreement can be found at:
https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum
.
According to this agreement, we are responsible for providing data protection information when using the Facebook tool and for the secure implementation of the tool on our website in accordance with data protection law. Facebook is responsible for the data security of Facebook products. You can assert data subject rights (e.g. requests for information) regarding the data processed by Facebook directly with Facebook. If you assert your data subject rights with us, we are obliged to forward them to Facebook.
Data transfer to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. Details can be found here:

LinkedIn Insight Tag
This website uses the Insight tag from LinkedIn. The provider of this service is LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.
Data processing by LinkedIn Insight Tag
With the help of the LinkedIn Insight Tag, we receive information about the visitors to our website. If a website visitor is registered with LinkedIn, we can, among other things, analyse the key professional data (e.g. career level, company size, country, location, industry and job title) of our website visitors and thus better tailor our site to the respective target groups. Furthermore, we can use LinkedIn Insight Tags to measure whether visitors to our websites make a purchase or take any other action (conversion measurement). Conversion measurement can also be carried out across devices (e.g. from PC to tablet). LinkedIn Insight Tag also offers a retargeting function that allows us to display targeted off-site advertising to visitors to our website. This, according to LinkedIn, does not identify the ad recipient.
LinkedIn itself also collects so-called log files (URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser properties and time of access). The IP addresses are shortened or (if they are used to reach LinkedIn members across devices) hashed (pseudonymised). The direct identifiers of LinkedIn members are deleted by LinkedIn after seven days. The remaining pseudonymised data is then deleted within 180 days.
The data collected by LinkedIn cannot be assigned to specific individuals by us as the website operator. LinkedIn will store the collected personal data of website visitors on its servers in the USA and use it in the context of its own advertising actions. For details, see LinkedIn's privacy policy at
https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?#choices-oblig
.

Qualtrics
We use the Qualtrics service, offered by Qualtrics LLC, 400 West Qualtrics Drive, Provo, UT 84606, United States, as part of customer experience management, panel creation and the implementation and evaluation of surveys. Data is transmitted to the Qualtrics platform in 256-bit TLS/SSL encryption and is fully pseudonymised.

Nevertheless, there are potential risks that cannot currently be completely ruled out despite the existing data protection and data security measures in connection with the processing. These are in particular:
Your personal data could possibly be processed by Qualtrics beyond the actual purpose of order fulfilment and could be obtained by third parties.
You may not be able to sustainably enforce your rights of access against Qualtrics.
7. Newsletter
Newsletter data
If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or only collected on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.
The data entered in the newsletter registration form is processed exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "Unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.
Analysing reading habits
We can analyse our newsletter campaigns with the help of tracking tools. When you open a sent e-mail, a file contained in the e-mail connects (so-called web-beacon). This makes it possible to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links, if any, have been clicked on. These details about how you interact with this content allow us to design, develop, deliver and improve our communications with you. This information is aggregated and utilised so that we can provide you with more useful information and find out what is of most interest to you.
Technical information is also collected (e.g. time of access, IP address, browser type and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. They are used exclusively for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.
The evaluation of the newsletter and the measurement of success are carried out, subject to the express consent of the user, on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purposes of using a user-friendly and secure newsletter system, which serves both our business interests in being able to better tailor our advertising e-mail communication to the interests of our customers and also meets the expectations of the users.
This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and Art. 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of beacons or access to information in the user's end device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. The same applies to the objection pursuant to Art. 21, para. 2 GDPR.
A separate cancellation of the success measurement is unfortunately not possible. If you wish to object to the success measurement, you must cancel your newsletter subscription. We provide a corresponding link for this purpose in every newsletter message
The data you provide us with for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter, shared with companies affiliated with the controller and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data that has been stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.
After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist, if necessary, in order to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is only used for this purpose and is not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.
If you purchase goods or services from us and provide your e-mail address, we reserve the right to use it to send newsletters with direct advertising for our own similar goods or services. This serves to safeguard our legitimate interests, which predominate in the context of a weighing up of interests, in an advertising approach to our customers. You can object to this use of your data at any time by sending a message to the contact options listed below or via the unsubscribe link in the advertising e-mail, without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. Insofar as the newsletter is sent on the basis of the sale of goods or services, we refer to the provisions of the Unfair Competition Act (UWG).

YouTube with enhanced data protection
This website embeds videos from the YouTube website. The operator of the pages is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
We use YouTube in extended data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode means that YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. However, the disclosure of data to YouTube partners is not necessarily excluded by the extended data protection mode. In this way, YouTube establishes a connection to the Google Marketing Network, regardless of whether you are watching a video.
As soon as you start a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube's servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your surfing behaviour directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
Furthermore, YouTube may store various cookies on your end device after starting a video or use comparable recognition technologies (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way, YouTube can obtain information about visitors to this website. This information is used, among other things, to collect video statistics, improve the user friendliness and prevent fraud attempts.
Where applicable, further data processing processes may be triggered after the start of a YouTube video, over which we have no influence.
YouTube is used in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

Data processing
Among other things, we use online conference tools to communicate with our clients. The tools we use individually are listed below. If you communicate with us by video or audio conference via the Internet, your personal data will be collected and processed by us and the provider of the respective conference tool.
The conference tools collect all data that you provide/enter to use the tools (e-mail address and/or your telephone number). Furthermore, the conference tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time) of participation in the conference, number of participants and other "contextual information" related to the communication process (metadata).
Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all technical data required for the handling of online communication. This includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs, device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera type, microphone or speaker, and the type of connection.
If content is exchanged, uploaded or otherwise made available within the tool, this is also stored on the servers of the tool providers. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud recordings, chat/instant messages, voicemails, uploaded photos and videos, files, whiteboards and other information shared while using the service.
Please note that we do not have full control over the data processing operations of the tools used. Our options are largely determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider. For further information on data processing by the conference tools, please refer to the privacy policies of the respective tools used, which we have listed below this text.
Purpose and legal basis
The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our customers (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools serves the general simplification and acceleration of communication with us or our company (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Insofar as consent has been requested, the tools in question are used on the basis of this consent; consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
Storage period
The data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools will be deleted from our systems as soon as you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your terminal until you delete them. Mandatory statutory retention periods remain unaffected. We have no influence on the storage period of your data, which is stored by the operators of the conference tools for their own purposes.

12. EGGER INSIDE Furniture Planner
Processing of user data
Data processing by your carpenter or distributor
The Furniture Planner (Furniture Planner and Furniture Planner PRO) is an application with which you as a user can configure a piece of furniture according to your individual requirements and then order it from your contractual partner. The person responsible for processing your personal data in connection with the furniture planner is generally your contractual partner or the site operator where the furniture is configured. This will provide you with information on the handling of your personal data, the legal basis and further information.
Nevertheless, we would like to briefly describe below how remote data processing takes place within the Furniture Planner:
If you would like to request a quotation in the Furniture Planner, you will need to provide some of your personal data in order to process and fulfil the quotation request.
Your data will be transmitted via the Furniture Planner application, stored and processed for the purpose of processing your request for a quotation or for the fulfilment of the contract by your contractual partner.
Your data is protected by appropriate technical and organisational measures by EGGER as the order processor of your contractual partner. To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data by third parties, the order process is encrypted using TLS technology.
Data processing for analysis purposes by EGGER
In addition to the processing by your contractual partner, EGGER Holzwerkstoffe Brilon GmbH&Co KG is responsible for the subsequent processing: If you consent to the processing, data will be collected for the analysis of user behaviour and for the provision of anonymised reports on the use of the Furniture Planner and its user-friendliness. By anonymising the IP address, it is no longer possible to identify you as a person in the reports.
The Google Analytics service is used in the Furniture Planner and the IP anonymisation function is activated. Further information on Google Analytics can be found in our data protection declaration under section 5. There you will also find information on the legal basis, the possibility of cancellation at any time and the storage of data.
In addition, we use the product enquiries to carry out statistical analyses (e.g. type of furniture configured, materials used, frequency of configuration). For this purpose, the personal reference is removed so that it is no longer possible to draw conclusions about you or your specific offer.
Please note: When using the Furniture Planner, your personal data may be passed on to US servers
. In this respect, we refer to the information on data transfer to the USA in section 2.
The Furniture Planner uses the Microsoft Azure Cloud. In addition to the standard contractual clauses and an order processing agreement, we have also concluded extensive data protection regulations for Microsoft online services (Data Protection Addendum, DPA) with Microsoft. It has been agreed that Microsoft will store the data exclusively in the EU. Processing by Microsoft is subject to the GDPR provisions under European Union law.
