Personally identifiable information, or personal information, is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you either online or offline. Playdek collects personal information when you register and create a user account in order to access certain content and/or utilize aspects of the Services. Playdek may also collect personally identifiable information during the course of your use of the Services and/or in connection with marketing or email campaigns. We do not require, as a condition of participation in any of our Services, that anyone disclose more information than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in an activity.
​
The type of personally identifiable information collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include your first and last name; e-mail address; account information for certain third party third party sites or networks (such as Facebook and Twitter), phone numbers; mailing address; and zip code. We will also collect the contact information of your friends, if you choose to connect your contacts and address book information with Playdek, and/or if you choose to connect those accounts with your Playdek account your login credentials to your social network accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter.

Information on Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We do not currently use “cookies” on Playdek’s website but may do so in the future. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a website visitor’s hard drive to help us improve your access to our website and identify repeat visitors to our website. For instance, when a cookie is used to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our website. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information on our website.
We do not currently use other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, or other web programming code, but may do so in the future from time to time. Such technologies may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Such technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the service, to monitor how users navigate the service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Such technologies may also enable us to send email messages in a format users can read, tell us whether mail has been opened, and ultimately allow us to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. Information collected by or from such technologies will be treated as non-personal information. To the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers may be considered personal information by local law, however, such information will be treated as personal information. To the extent that non-personal information may also be combined with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

How Your Personally Identifiable Information Is Protected from Misuse
The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to attempt to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper use. However, please understand that no security measure is perfect or impenetrable and therefore we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personally identifiable information. We also protect your personally identifiable information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
​
Bulletin Boards and Chat Areas
Users of the Services are solely responsible for the content of messages they post on public forums, such as chat rooms and bulletin boards. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number), as well as other personal ideas, photographs, writings, music, comments, suggestions and other materials (collectively “User Content”) on the bulletin boards, blogs, or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.
​
Please note that Playdek does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. Playdek is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on through the Services or what others do with information you share with them on the Services. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Services.
