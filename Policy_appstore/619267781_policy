Safety precautions
We shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk, in accordance with Article 32 DSGVO, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing and the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons; the measures shall include in particular safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data, as well as the access, input, transmission, security of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that guarantee the exercise of data subject rights, deletion of data and reaction to data risks. Furthermore, we already consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly presettings (Art. 25 DSGVO).

Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or leave the data in a third country only if the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. Process DSGVO.

Administration, financial accounting, office organization, contact management
We process data within the framework of administrative tasks as well as the organisation of our company, financial accounting and compliance with legal obligations, e.g. archiving. We process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The processing bases are Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c. DSGVO, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO. Customers, prospects, business partners and website visitors are affected by the processing. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organization, archiving of data, thus tasks which serve the maintenance of our business activities, perception of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of the data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the information provided in these processing activities.
We disclose or transmit data to the tax authorities, consultants, such as tax consultants or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.
Furthermore, we store information on suppliers, event organisers and other business partners on the basis of our business interests, e.g. for the purpose of making contact at a later date. We store this data, which is mainly company-related, permanently.
Business analyses and market research
In order to operate our business economically and to identify market trends, customer and user requirements, we analyse the data available to us on business transactions, contracts, enquiries, etc., in order to ensure that we are able to offer our customers the best possible service. We process inventory data, communication data, contract data, payment data, usage data, metadata on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO, whereby the persons concerned include customers, interested parties, business partners, visitors and users of the online offer.
The analyses are carried out for the purpose of economic evaluations, marketing and market research. In doing so, we can consider the profiles of registered users with information e.g. about their purchase processes. The analyses serve us to increase the user-friendliness, the optimization of our offer and the economic efficiency. The analyses serve us alone and are not disclosed externally, unless they are anonymous analyses with aggregated values.
If these analyses or profiles are personal, they will be deleted or made anonymous upon termination of the user, otherwise after two years from the conclusion of the contract. For the rest, macroeconomic analyses and general trend determinations are prepared anonymously wherever possible.
Registration function
Users can optionally create a user account. During the registration process, users will be provided with the required information. The data entered during registration will be used for the purpose of using the offer. Users can be informed by e-mail about information relevant to offers or registration, such as changes to the scope of offers or technical circumstances. If users have terminated their user account, their data will be deleted with regard to the user account, subject to its storage is necessary for commercial or tax reasons according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. It is up to the users to save their data before the end of the contract if they have given notice of termination. We are entitled to irretrievably delete all user data stored during the term of the contract.

The data is stored on the basis of our legitimate interests as well as the user's protection against misuse and other unauthorized use. A passing on of this data to third parties does not take place in principle, unless it is necessary to pursue our claims or there is a legal obligation in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. The IP addresses are anonymized or deleted after 7 days at the latest.
Contacting

Retrieval of profile pictures from Gravatar
We use the service Gravatar of Automattic Inc. 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA, within our online offer and especially in our blog.
Gravatar is a service where users can log in and store profile pictures and their e-mail addresses. If users leave contributions or comments with the respective e-mail address on other online presences (above all in blogs), their profile pictures can be displayed next to the contributions or comments. For this purpose, the e-mail address provided by the users is transmitted to Gravatar in encrypted form for the purpose of checking whether a profile has been saved for it. This is the sole purpose of the transmission of the e-mail address and it will not be used for other purposes, but will be deleted thereafter.
The use of Gravatar is based on our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 letter f) DSGVO, as we offer the possibility of personalising their contributions with a profile picture with the help of Gravatar.
By displaying the images, Gravatar obtains the IP address of the users, as this is necessary for communication between a browser and an online service. Further information on the collection and use of data by Gravatar can be found in Automattic's data protection information: https://automattic.com/privacy/.
If users do not want an image associated with their email address to appear in Gravatar's comments, you should use a non-Gravatar email address for commenting. We would also like to point out that it is also possible to use an anonymous or no e-mail address if users do not wish their own e-mail address to be sent to Gravatar. Users can completely prevent the transfer of data by not using our comment system.
Newsletter
With the following information we inform you about the contents of our newsletter as well as the registration, dispatch and statistical evaluation procedure and your rights of objection. By subscribing to our newsletter you agree to the receipt and the described procedures.
Content of the newsletter: We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications containing advertising information (hereinafter "newsletters") only with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission. If the contents of a newsletter are specifically described within the scope of a registration, they are decisive for the consent of the users. In addition, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.
Double opt-in and logging: Subscription to our newsletter takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can log in with other e-mail addresses. Subscriptions to the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process in accordance with legal requirements. This includes the storage of the login and confirmation time, as well as the IP address. The changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider are also logged.
Credentials: To subscribe to the newsletter, simply enter your e-mail address. Optionally, we ask you to enter a name in the newsletter in order to address us personally.
Germany: The dispatch of the newsletter and the performance measurement associated with it is based on the recipient's consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, Art. 7 DSGVO in conjunction with § 7 para. 2 no. 3 UWG or on the basis of the legal permission pursuant to § 7 para. 3 UWG.
The registration procedure is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. We are interested in the use of a user-friendly and secure newsletter system that serves both our business interests and the expectations of users and also allows us to provide proof of consent.
Cancellation/Revocation - You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each newsletter. We may store the e-mail addresses we have unsubscribed for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to prove a previously given consent. The processing of these data is limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims. An individual application for cancellation is possible at any time, provided that at the same time the former existence of a consent is confirmed.
Newsletter - Newsletter2Go
The newsletter is sent by the shipping service Newsletter2Go GmbH, Nürnberger Straße 8, 10787 Berlin, Germany. The data protection regulations of the shipping service provider can be viewed here:
https://www.newsletter2go.de/datenschutz/
. The dispatch service provider is used on the basis of our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 Para. 1 letter f DSGVO and an order processing contract according to Art. 28 Para. 3 S. 1 DSGVO.
The shipping service provider can use the recipient's data in pseudonymous form, i.e. without assignment to a user, to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. to technically optimize the dispatch and presentation of the newsletter or for statistical purposes. However, the shipping service does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write them down itself or to pass the data on to third parties.
Newsletter - measurement of success
The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file which is downloaded from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a shipping service provider, from whose server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are initially collected.
This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behaviour based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. The statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our endeavour, nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our contents to them or to send different contents according to the interests of our users.
Google Analytics
On the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by users is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active
).
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services associated with the use of this online offer and the use of the Internet. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.
We use Google Analytics only with IP anonymization enabled. This means that Google will reduce the IP address of users within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other Google data. Users may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on their browser software; users may also prevent Google from collecting data generated by the cookie and relating to their use of the website and from processing this data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
.
Further information on data use by Google, setting and objection options, can be found in Google's data protection declaration. (
https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
) as well as in the settings for the display of advertisements by Google
(https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated
).
Users' personal data will be deleted or made anonymous after 14 months.
Google Adsense with non-personalized ads
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 letter f. DSGVO) the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, ("Google").
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active
).
We use the AdSense service, which displays ads in some of our apps and pays us for their display or other use. For these purposes, usage data such as the click on an advertisement and the IP address of the user are processed, whereby the IP address is shortened by the last two digits. Therefore, the processing of the user's data is pseudonymised.
We use Adsense with non-personalized ads. The ads are not displayed on the basis of user profiles. Non-personalized ads are not based on previous user behavior. Targeting uses contextual information, including rough geographic targeting (e.g. at the local level) based on the current location, the content of the current website or app, and current search terms. Google prevents any personalized targeting, including demographic targeting and targeting based on user lists.
Further information on data use by Google, possible settings and objections can be found in Google's data protection declaration (
https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
) and in the settings for the display of advertisements by Google
(https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated
).
Online presence in social media
We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to communicate with active customers, interested parties and users and to inform them about our services. When accessing the respective networks and platforms, the terms and conditions and the data processing guidelines of their respective operators apply.
Unless otherwise stated in our privacy policy, we process the data of users who communicate with us within social networks and platforms, e.g. write articles on our websites or send us messages.
Integration of third-party services and content
Within our online offer, we make no representations or warranties of any kind based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) content or service offerings of third parties to incorporate their content and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").
This always presupposes that the third party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content. We make every effort to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address only for the delivery of the contents. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. Pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other information about the use of our online offer, as well as be linked to such information from other sources.
