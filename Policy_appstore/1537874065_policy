11. Ydeevne
Du forstår og accepterer, at driften og tilgængeligheden af de systemer, der bruges til at overføre oplysninger eller til at tilgå og interagere med Softwaren, herunder offentlige telefon- og computernetværk og internettet, uanset om de leveres eller gøres tilgængelige af os, dig eller andre, kan være uforudsigelige og fra tid til anden kan forstyrre eller forhindre adgang til og/eller brug eller drift af Softwaren.

sikre, at du har givet os de aktuelle og korrekte e-mailoplysninger. Alle meddelelser, som sendes af os via Softwaren eller til den e-mailadresse, som du sidst har oplyst, skønnes gyldige og virkningsfulde fra den dato, hvorpå vi slog dem op på Softwaren eller e-mailede dem til dig, og vi er ikke erstatningsansvarlige eller ansvarlige, såfremt en meddelelse ikke når frem til dig, fordi du ikke har givet os de korrekte oplysninger eller har undladt at opdatere dem.

15.1 Vilkårenes uafhængighed og frafald
Såfremt et Vilkår i disse Vilkår findes at være ulovligt, ugyldigt eller uden retskraft i henhold til en gældende ret, skønnes et sådant Vilkår, for så vidt som det kan udskilles fra de resterende Vilkår, udeladt fra disse Vilkår og vil på ingen måde påvirke lovligheden, gyldigheden eller retskraften for de resterende Vilkår.
Et skriftligt frafald fra den anden part af nogen af den anden parts forpligtelser i henhold til disse Vilkår eller en undladelse af at insistere på nøje overholdelse af en forpligtelse vil ikke fungere som et frafald af eller hindring for så vidt angår en efterfølgende eller anden undladelse.
15.2 Definitioner og overskrifter
Henvisninger til:
15.2.1 Softwaren omfatter henvisninger til alle modifikationer, patches, opdateringer, opgraderinger, nye versioner og udgivelser af den software, som er leveret fra os til dig, medmindre den leveres til dig i henhold til Vilkårene i en særskilt licensaftale, som er indgået med os.
15.2.2 Du, dig og dine er en henvisning til dig, der som individ tilgår og bruger Softwaren, og
15.2.3 Vi, os, vores og Allocate er en henvisning til Allocate Software Limited, som er en virksomhed, der er indregistreret i England og Wales (virksomhedsnr.: 2814942) og med hjemsted på 2nd Floor, 1 Church Road, Richmond, TW9 2QE og dens autoriserede efterfølgere og rettighedserhververe.

15.3 Overdragelse og udlicitering
Disse Vilkår og dine rettigheder, pligter og forpligtelser i henhold hertil er personlige for dig, og du må ikke overdrage dine rettigheder, uddelegere dine pligter eller udlicitere dine rettigheder uden vores forudgående skriftlige samtykke, som vi kan give eller tilbageholde alene efter vores eget skøn.  Vi kan tildele, overdrage eller udlicitere disse Vilkår og/eller alle eller nogen af vores rettigheder og forpligtelser i henhold dertil eller give eller udlicitere alle eller nogen af vores rettigheder og forpligtelser til en hvilken som helst person eller enhed. Parternes rettigheder og forpligtelser vil forpligte og have virkning for deres respektive efterfølgere og autoriserede rettighedserhververe.
15.4 Ændringer
Vi forbeholder os til enhver tid retten til at ændre Vilkårene i disse Vilkår, herunder vores politik om beskyttelse af personoplysninger, ved at slå en revideret version op på Softwaren eller via andre meddelelser til dig i overensstemmelse med § 14.1. Al brug af Softwaren af dig efter en sådan meddelelse om sådanne ændringer udgør din accept af disse Vilkår med ændringer. Såfremt du ikke accepterer at være bundet af de ændrede Vilkår, må du ikke fortsætte med at bruge Softwaren. Disse Vilkår må ikke ændres på anden måde udover, hvad der aftales skriftligt af begge parter.
15.5 Aftalens fuldstændighed
15.5.1 Hver part anerkender, at denne ved at indgå i disse Vilkår ikke gør det på baggrund af og ikke er afhængig af nogen erklæring, garanti eller anden bestemmelse med undtagelse af, hvad der udtrykkeligt er angivet i disse Vilkår, og alle forpligtelser, garantier og andre Vilkår, der følger af lovgivningen eller sædvaneretten, udelukkes hermed i det videst mulige omfang, loven tillader.

15.5.3 Du og vi anerkender og accepterer, at fordelingen af risici og erstatningsansvar i disse Vilkår er rimelige under alle omstændigheder for så vidt angår alle relevante faktorer, herunder Softwarens funktionalitet og evner samt afprøvnings- og evalueringsformål med denne licens.
15.5.4 Intet i pkt. 15.5 begrænser eller udelukker erstatningsansvar for urigtige oplysninger fremsat i ond tro.
15.6 Afhjælpning ved forbud
Hver part anerkender, at misligholdelse af pkt. 1, 3, 4, 9 og 10 i disse Vilkår ville forårsage uoprettelig skade for den anden part, for hvilket der ikke er noget tilstrækkeligt retsmiddel, og hver part aftaler derfor, udover de andre tilgængelige retsmidler, at den forurettede part er berettiget til at søge afhjælpning ved forbud for at gennemtvinge Vilkårene i pkt. 1, 3, 4, 9 og 10. Den vindende part er berettiget til at få dækket alle omkostninger og udgifter, herunder rimelige advokatsalærer, som er påløbet på grund af en sådan retssag.
15.7 Force majeure
Vi er ikke ansvarlige for nogen manglende opfyldelse, der skyldes årsager, der ligger uden for vores rimelige kontrol, herunder naturkatastrofer, terrorisme, krig, optøjer, eksport- og importforbud, handlinger fra civile eller militære myndigheder, nationale katastrofer, strejker og lignende.
15.8 Ret
Disse Vilkår reguleres af og fortolkes i overensstemmelse med dansk ret, og eventuelle uenigheder skal indbringes for de danske domstole.

Selvom Apple ikke er en part i disse Vilkår, er Apple og deres datterselskaber tredjepartsberettiget i forbindelse med disse Vilkår. Apple har ret til at gennemtvinge disse Vilkår overfor dig som tredjepartsberettiget i forbindelse med din brug af Softwaren eller Allocate Loop iOS-appen.
16.1.2 Du må kun bruge Allocate Loop iOS-appen på en iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad eller anden Apple-enhed eller andre Apple-mærkede produkter, som du ejer og kontrollerer, og som det tillades af brugsreglerne, som er angivet i Apple Media Services’ Vilkår og betingelser.

Intet i disse Vilkår skønnes at være en indrømmelse af, at du måtte have sådanne krav.
16.1.5 Allocate er ikke forpligtet til at holde dig skadesløs eller forsvare dig for så vidt angår tredjepartskrav, der opstår på grund af eller vedrørende Allocate Loop iOS-appen. I det omfang, at Allocate i henhold til gældende ret skal yde skadesløsholdelse, er Allocate, ikke Apple, eneansvarlig for at undersøge, forsvare, afgøre og ophæve ethvert krav om, at Allocate Loop iOS-appen eller din besiddelse og brug af den krænker en tredjeparts immaterielle rettigheder, og
16.1.6 Du erklærer og garanterer, at (i) du ikke befinder dig i et land, der er genstand for eksport- eller importforbud fra den amerikanske regering, eller som af den amerikanske regering er angivet som et land, der “støtter terrorisme”, og (ii) at du ikke er opført på en liste fra den amerikanske regering over forbudte eller begrænsede parter.
