HISTORY IN THE MAKING
Following a successful 36th edition of World Class Golf, Rory McIlroy returned to defend his 2024 Dallah Trophy, but Tyrrell Hatton emerged victorious and became the winner of the 2025 Hero Dubai Desert Classic.
The Dubai Desert Classic was founded in 1989 as the first DP World Tour event to take place in the Gulf, and in 2023 it became and still is the first and only GEO Certified® golf event in the Middle East. Regarded as one of the most significant events on the DP World Tour, and part of the prestigious Rolex Series, it has been credited with paving the way for golf’s presence in the Middle East, as well as creating some of the most iconic moments in golfing history.
The Hero Dubai Desert Classic returns in January 2026 with some of the world’s top golfers, all competing for the $9million prize pool at this prestigious DP World Tour Rolex Series event. Enjoy daily entertainment, live music, a dedicated kids’ zone, plus great food and drinks over four fun filled days with friends and all the family. Don’t miss out on the action at the Emirates Golf Club.
